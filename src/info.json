So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life\u2013until the unthinkable happens.Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582135294l/36809135.jpg", "title": "Where the Crawdads Sing", "authors": "Delia Owens", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing", "reviews": ["*5 Stars, easily!*WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a gentle yet symbolic depiction of the valiant survival of Kya Clark\u2014a reclusive young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, school system, the entire town surrounding her, and what ultimately feels like life itself. Mother Nature has literally become Kya\u2019s caretaker, and deep in a lonely Marsh along the North Carolina coast is where Kya will not only hide, but blossom into a primal independent being, coaxed inside the loyal embrace of an indiscriminate wilderness as she embodies its uninhibited spirit. Until a young boy from \u201cyonder\u201d befriends Kya, and her lonely existence is shaken straight to its solemn core. Add to that the curious unsolved murder of the town\u2019s local \u201cGolden Boy\u201d, and all that\u2019s left to say is GAME. ON. Although this story delivers one hell of a \npowerful\n punch, it is sculpted with quite a humble hand; a delicate wind that keeps building and building until it ends up emphatically blowing your mind. The writing. \nThe Writing\n\u2026Prose so unique; so breathtaking; so utterly beautiful that a single description of a firefly suddenly grows so intimate and probing, and I might have gotten something in my eye\u2014*sniff*. Here you\u2019ll find sentences that read like poetry, with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy over 0ver-the-top --- but perfect. Owens doesn't tell us what to think, but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense, atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine, all on our own. She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya, and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love. Kya\u2019s journey spans years, the reader present from her childhood into maturity. I love this story\u2019s ode to wilderness and Mother Earth with all her glorious wonder; her instinctual need to nurture and protect. I love each character\u2019s flawed nature as well as those redeemed. I love the heart and soul that saturates every inch of this story, and more than anything, I LOVE that spectacularly bold ending! There were a few tedious moments where I thought this story might begin to drag and possibly not live up to its hype, but I was wrong, and this story was so, SO right. To the reader who appreciates nature\u2019s effortless beauty honored in fiction; to those who seek a love story every bit true as it is tender; to the one who needs a tantalizing murder/mystery to spice things up, and for those who tend to root for the underdog in hopes she\u2019ll someday sparkle like the gem she is\u2014this one\u2019s for you. \n*Traveling Friends Read*\n", "All the Stars!!!!!Can I just say that I loved everything about this book and leave it at that!?!Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of resiliency, survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, desperation, prejudice, determination and strength. This book goes back and forth in time to tell the story of Kya Clark a.k.a. the Marsh girl. She lives on the outskirts of town, in the Marsh, and the locals look down their noses at her, she is judged, ridiculed and bullied. But there are those who show her kindness, friendship, and show her love. Oh, how I loved this book!Kya was a young girl when her Mother walked away without looking back. Soon, all her siblings followed suit, leaving Kya alone with her often absent, drunk, and abusive father. She is left to care for their home, to cook, clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop, to cook and to provide food for herself in her father's absence. All while dealing with loneliness, feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return. She was a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs. Soon 'Jumpin and his wife, Mable, show her kindness, generosity and love. I dare you not to adore this couple!As Kya grows and learns more about life through her interactions with the creatures of the Marsh, two young men enter her life. One is her brother's older friend, Tate, who teaches her to read and shows her acceptance and happiness. Another brings her hope of a future but won\u2019t introduce her to his friends and family. Could one be her chance at happiness? A chance at belonging? A chance at being accepted? A chance at being loved? A Chance for growth? Or will history repeat itself?In 1969, local football legend, Chase Andrews is found dead. Rumors swirl as to motive and possible suspects. Rumors have been circulating for years about Chase and his involvement with the Marsh girl. Could she be his killer? What motive could she have?This book had a little bit of everything that I love: a likeable main character who pulls at your heartstrings, murder mystery, atmosphere, drama, coming of age, and romance. There are several characters who give and show kindness including, Tate, the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give, give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh. I highly recommend this book! It's thoughtful, evokes emotion, and transports the reader back in time to the Marsh. I loved every page. Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com", "All of you talked me into reading this book. The Goodreads reviews were virtually unanimously good, not just good, great. It had to be good, I thought. And because I needed an extra audiobook I bought it on Libro.fm and locked myself into reading it. Bad decision.This book is just a pile of tropes and cliches dressed up in some nice nature writing. The plot is not much of a plot and the mystery makes up only a small section of the book, and much of it ends up being courtroom scenes and not much mystery. This book is basically Manic Pixie Dream Girl In the Marsh. We spend a long time with young Kya, abandoned, fending for herself, almost entirely isolated. I was willing to be patient through all that, to see what kind of person she would grow into because that had the potential to be very interesting.Except it was not. It became less interesting the longer I read. Because Kya doesn't act like a person who has been almost entirely isolated. She just acts like a regular loner. Sure, she may have some habits that fit with her strange upbringing, but she seems to understand people and language just like a regular person. I was nearly out of my head with frustration that the book had spent so long telling me how different she was only to have her be just the same as most people. (Deciding to never love again because everyone leaves you is a pretty regular-person thing to do when you're in your 20's, for example.)This isn't a book of deep psychological insight. You can probably guess from a couple of chapters in how it will end. (And you would be right!) There are no real revelations, the plot is pretty obvious ahead of time. And it's all rather confusing because there are sections where Owens writes well, her courtroom scenes are actually quite competent, but on both the broad strokes and the specific details nothing here really rings true. And the more time that passed the more I got annoyed with this book so it finally fell from 3-stars to a rare 2-star review. (I usually quit a 2-star book.) If you're going to give me a plot I've seen a thousand times, at least wrap it in some keen insight or character development. But sadly this was a failure for me all around.", "You know that person? The one who doesn't like what everyone else seems to love? There has to be someone in the outlier club and this time it is me. I was highly anticipating this book after reading all the praise from readers whose tastes usually align with my own. Unfortunately, I should have DNF'd this one when very early in the book, my eyes glazed over and I began skimming pages and pages of descriptive writing. The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don\u2019t care for overly descriptive writing. And then there's poetry. I skipped over those as well. Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I won't list them all, but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn\u2019t get past. To make things worse, romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it. Finally, I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I don't like. This wasn't one of those times.Recommended for readers who enjoy long, descriptive nature writing, and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief. If I had known these things before starting this book I would have skipped it, so perhaps my review will help other readers like me.* Thanks to Edelweiss for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review", "\u00bb 4.53 across 160,000 ratings on Goodreads.\u00bb 400+ holds at my library (I actually had to buy this).\u00bb #1 on the Amazon charts.\u00bb On virtually every Book Club's reading list....and I can\u2019t finish it. I\u2019m sorry. I do realise with those numbers it is definitely me. I read all of Part 1 and the first chapter of Part 2, then I gave up at page 156. Nothing seemed to be happening other than Kya fishing and cooking grits. There are lots of pretty nature metaphors like:\nWaves slammed one another, awash in their own white saliva, breaking apart on the shore with loud booms\u2014 energy searching for a beachhead. Then they flattened into quiet tongues of foam, waiting for the next surge.\nBut I just don\u2019t enjoy descriptions of trees, swamps and bugs that much. It's funny. Usually when a book doesn't float my boat, I can still totally understand the hype. I wouldn't have called this one, though, I must admit. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "I really enjoyed the parts of this book that were related to the marsh and the natural world, but the story itself did not wow me. I am definitely in the minority here - many glowing reviews, but it had a \u201cwomen\u2019s literature\u201d flavor to me that I don\u2019t personally care for.A nice fiction debut for Owens; just not my cuppa.", "Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia OwensNormally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I\u2019ve decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully schizophrenic\u2014almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author\u2019s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul\u2014I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids\u2019 scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of Law and Order, where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go by the diner on the way out there.\u201d \u201cWell, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town\u2019s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew\u2019s murder\u2019s the biggest thing\u2019s happened \u2019round here, maybe ever. Gossip\u2019s goin\u2019 up like smoke signals.\u201d\u201cWell, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne\u2019er-do-wells can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d(61)Why not just, \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime? In real life, people do not say everything they\u2019re thinking or narrate everything that\u2019s happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think\u2014if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn\u2019t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya\u2019s character. Sorry, friends who adore this book, I\u2019m an outlier on this one, I guess.", "I'm typically skeptical of books that are hyped to high heavens and end up on every book club list for months straight, not because they aren't worthy, but because I can let my expectations get the best of me and keep me from fully enjoying a wonderful book. This book exceeded my already high expectations; it emanates a quiet power, a slow drawing in and connection of reader to book, one that I found myself able to get lost in due to the lush atmosphere and the depth of emotion. I can see now why this book is getting so much attention, and am thrilled to see that for once the hype train was right on track. ", "This is a real controversial book to be hated or to be wholeheartedly loved. I was at the team of deeply in lovers. And I know most of the good readers couldn\u2019t finish it. But if they also give it a shot to try the audiobook read by Cassandra Campbell, I\u2019m positively sure that they will love the story and all the nature parts because this is not only Marsh Girl\u2019s heart-wrenching, sad, poignant, poetic story, but this is also about nature. When you listen to this book, you feel like the story is narrated by nature\u2026The swamp, the trees, all those rare kinds of birds, breezing wind, wild animal\u2019s roaring\u2026That\u2019s all out there and you can hear them, smell them, imagine them in your mind\u2026 It\u2019s so alive, realistic, rejuvenating!So this book is about hate, abandonment, neglect, reject to accept the differences of other people.A little girl tries to stay alive on this wild nature but old those wild, unpredictable, dangerous creatures of nature never scared her. The ruthless people who are adamant to hurt, humiliate, insult her were the real threat she needed to protect from.She feels alive by communicating with the birds because they cannot hurt them with their words, they cannot humiliate her with insulting words. They just fly freely and travel around the world as she is stuck in the swamp and gets jealous of their freedom to escape whenever they want.So she exists by resonating with nature and befriending the birds to fight against her abandonment, sorrow and unhappiness.I felt for Marsh Girl. I wanted her not only exist but live her life fully. I loved the romantic parts and I wished her happy ending.And about the final twist: My spider senses worked that time. Even it was sucker punching kind of surprise, it could still be expected. It still shook me to the core and I cried for her.This is my second round with the book. The author\u2019s writing style a little exhausted me at the first but them words found their rhythm on my head like a lyrical and eccentric journey and I started to enjoy each chapter and let the words take the control of my heart and ache for the characters. As soon as I started listening to the audiobook, I fell in love this book one more time.So this was my favorite historical fiction of last year and I didn\u2019t want to leave it without writing a few words how it made me feel after my second waltz with it! It was spectacular journey and I enjoyed it again and again!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "4.5 stars rounded up .A story of survival, of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother, then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father, because of his meanness, his abuse, his drinking. What she doesn\u2019t understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn\u2019t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned, remembering the beatings, trying to figure out a way to eat. Atmospheric is an understatement, and I don\u2019t use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place, the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya\u2019s realization \u201cAnd the marsh became her mother.\u201d The marsh becomes her life, her livelihood, the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds, her art. But is it enough to heal her? The kind hearts of Jumpin\u2019 and Mabel who help a little girl alone and in need, the only human contact she has until her brother\u2019s friend Tate comes into her life, but is that enough to help her heal ? I love the writing, fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants, the insects, the fish, the birds which pique Kya\u2019s curiosity, give her so much joy and company, and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?There\u2019s a murder mystery, not my usual fare, but I was totally engaged, trying to come up with who the murderer was, totally engaged in the courtroom scenes. I gave it 4.5 stars because there were a couple of things that felt not quite realistic. But when I woke up thinking about this story, I knew I would round it up to 5 stars . I don\u2019t often cry over books, but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read, heartbreaking in so many ways, with wonderful writing and characters, a stunning portrait of a place, of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya, a character to remember. An unforgettable ending. This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together. In this case, we have very similar feelings about this beautiful story.I received an advanced copy of this book from G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons through Edelweiss. ", "there are currently 582 people waiting for this book at my library. at first i thought that notification was a glitch; but then i read this, this impossibly tender story, and now im shocked as to why the waitlist isnt twice that. there is a reason this book has become so sought after, and it feels like a privilege to have experienced it. this is one of the most memorable coming-of-age stories i have read in quite some time. it is a story that proves the growth of a person and the cultivation of nature are not mutually exclusive. this book is a celebration of all life, human and mother earth alike. there is a very special connection between kya and the environment which raised her. the elegant prose and lyrical depictions of the marshlands are so beautifully comforting, guiding the reader through kyas world, just as it guided her throughout life. i cannot describe what an intimate feeling it is, to see the world through kyas eyes. its so enlightening to see someone comprehend that even though there is a harshness to surviving, there is also immense wonder and beauty.this story is as touching as it is inspiring. and i now have a very strong desire to take an evening walk, look at the stars, and just marvel at the world in which i live. \u21a0 5 stars", "\nI've been wanting to read this book for months!!I keep seeing amazing reviews, there are literally 250,000+ ratings so far on here...I should finally have my hands on it within the month according to my library waiting list (I was #200 and something... FINALLY!!).... and I'm DNFing it lol I can't do it.\n", "MEMORABLE CHARACTERS AND MEMORABLE STORY. For me to rate a book five stars it has to give me something bout of the ordinary, make me feel. Most of all it has to be a book or contain a character or characters that I won't forget. Above all it has to make me feel. This book did all three. Kya, aka Catherine Clark, the Marsh girl is an unforgettable character, abandoned by her mother at she six, her siblings shortly after. By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself, her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh, the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart, curious, feArless and so lonely. As if this character wasn't enough to remember, there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel, a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate, who has known her since she was small, teaches her to read anc much more. What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out, trust? Prejudice is a big theme, because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate, unclean, and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian, who claims to love her, but marries another, breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in, a story told in alternate chapters, as when he is murdered , she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in, a man, 74 years old, a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.I could nitpick a few things, but I won't. I loved and learned much about the natural world, a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily wouldn't. A survival story, what Kya has to do it not easy, but since she has little choice it is what she does. Making the most of what one has, regardless of how little. More than one I had tears running down my face, so this gets five, big marshmallow stars from this reader.This was mine, Angela and Esils August read, and as always our reads and discussions are something in which I look forward.ARC from Edelweiss.", "Library Overdrive Audiobook... read by Cassandra Campbell ....Listening to this book was a \u2018fantastic\u2019 choice!!! I plan to buy the physical book, too. I want to re-read many of the sentences - see them in written book form...and own a book by Delia Owens. She\u2019s a one-of-a-kind-author!!!This book could easily become a modern classic!  The prose is so outstanding \u2014 gorgeous\u2014that the smells and visuals of the wildlife \u2014 made me feel as if I was there too.  \u2014 a world with no walls\u2014birds, nests, water, shells, mussels, grasses, trees, \u2014 \u2014 the *marshlands* - becomes a living character in this story. Listening to this novelwhile being outside \u2014surrounded by plants -birds - squirrels- trees- and water myself- added reminders of respect for the world around us....which those who spend time alone in nature know what I\u2019m talking about: quiet transformative thoughts arise with the beauty of the ecosystems.Our human energy is tantalizingly free in ways it never is when indoors behind our computers and other technical devices. The Audiobook narrator -Cassandra Campbell, completely transported me to this world. The voice of Kya was PERFECT!!!! She used many different inflections for each character. I wanted to know Tate Walker and Jumper...but it\u2019s Kya Clark, who dominant my heart and thoughts. She was not only abandoned by her family - but so many in her town rejected her. Abandonment as a child - hours upon hours of a solitary life ... playing in creeks, climbing trees, mudboarding the surface of the beach waters, digging for crabs, no parents around - is a memory which comes back to me from my own childhood....wandering outdoors...Kya Clark is tenacious- brave - resilient- an indomitable heroine....but has flaws too...which made me like her more. The circumstances of her unfortunate family inheritance is heartbreaking enough...but to suspect her of a crime... of murder? - it was almost hard to suspend belief. And so ugly to have a reputation as \u2018swamp trash\u2019. And how is it possible - and why - for heavens sake would a little girl kill an older bigger football player, Andrew Chase? There is suspense in this novel that I didn\u2019t expect or know anything about when I started reading this. I had no idea I was about to read about a murder mystery...not that it\u2019s the prime focus.. but... so much about this book with \u2018mostly\u2019 positive reviews....were surprises to me. Set in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s....alternating timelines.....around the North Carolina Coast marshlands ....The 60\u2019s is the story of Andrew Chase - his body found dead: who killed him?...and a courtroom case...The 50\u2019s is completely Kya\u2019s story - from when her mother left - [The Dominate Story].....*Kya Clark*!!It\u2019s Kya we can\u2019t stop thinking about!!!Kya couldn\u2019t read or write - but there is an inspiring coming of age story in here with a few Guardian Angels - so to speak who are \u2018for\u2019 Kya. We witness Kya out-shine her neglectful youth. Really emotionally moving!!!Mystery murder - suspense - coming of age - occasional cuisine meals to remember- Nature at its best...Gulls as friends...Loneliness...heartbreaking sadness - Human connections...&Trust issues...A little romance...Completely captivating: story & prose!!!! *Delia Owens* will soon be a household name to readers. What in the world will she write next?", "At the time of reading, this book seems to be the most hyped book in my Goodreads feed. Not a minute goes by without a review or update from this book popping up. If you know me, you know that no matter the type of book or the subject matter, if it is hyped I want to give it a go. With that in mind, when I started this, the only thing I knew about it was its hype \u2013 I knew zero about the story, genre, type of book, etc. I just had a cover and a title!Did it live up to the hype?I think it did. I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that \u201cheart-strings were pulled\u201d, and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good, well-told story you will like this one. Who do I recommend it to?Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot.I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But, there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger.Also, while only a little steamy at times, I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again, if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance, you will not find it here, but the relationships in the story should be of interest.Should you read it?I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this, I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So, if you have seen the hype in your feed, too, and have been wondering, I think you should try it out. You may not be blown away, but I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed.", "I seem to be finding myself in the minority a lot these days. The first half of this book was pretty close to marvelous, and then it went south on me (that is a pun). Anyway, after my attempt at weak humor, let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted, albeit gradually, by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment, which would be a necessity to survive in such a place, and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company, she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive, whether she would connect with the outside world, and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then, in what seemed an abrupt change of tone, the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.I am sorry this didn\u2019t work for me. I wanted it to, indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read, I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.I had originally rated this a 3-star read, but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only \"OK\" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars. I think I felt shy of giving it only 2 when so many of my respected friends had given it 5...but truth should prevail.", "Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is a 2018 G.P. Putnam's Sons publication. One part mystery, one part legal drama, one part coming of age story, and one part love story- equals a full heartrending poignant tale that will leave you gasping for air. Barkley Cove, North Carolina- 1969Kya Clark- aka- \u201cThe Marsh Girl\u2019 has been abandoned, one by one, by every single person in her life. She lives by the seat of her pants, in a shack, eluding everyone, except a friend of her brother\u2019s named, Tate. Tate watches out for Kya, when he\u2019s able, and teaches her to read, among other things. As time moves on, however, despite a deepening affection for Kya, Tate knows he'll have to leave, and go away to college. While he's away, the myth of \u2018The Marsh Girl\u2019 will solidify forevermore. Kya will face a challenge like no other, and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove, with folks who have taunted her, shunned her, and judged her, her entire life.In 2016-17, there were several stellar novels written, which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent, \u2018off the grid\u2019 environment, living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable, or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme. Yet, with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers, I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So, obviously, I succumbed, and checked it out of the library. I never doubted the book would be a good one, I just didn\u2019t know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect. But as it turns out, this story isn\u2019t really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing, or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape, as I had originally thought. While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence, this is also a very tender coming of age tale, a story of survival, but also a story of real friendship, true love, and what it means to truly feel free. Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak, even from unexpected sources, but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But, all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh, and Kya\u2019s life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight. The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations, especially with Kya\u2019s character study, is another area in which the book excels. There are layers of thought -provoking topics, and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out, but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction, this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However, you should allow yourself to go along with it, because that is part of the beauty of fiction, and it is well worth any required suspension of belief. Ultimately, I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be, but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama, I enjoyed the trial scenes, and the mystery elements, but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain. 4 stars", "***I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS BOOK MAKING THE #1 SPOT ON THE NYT Bestseller list, I knew this would be a winner***Oh how beautifully mesmerizing this book is. I\u2019ve moved this book to the #1 spot in my list of favorite books of 2018. Thanks to my Goodreads friends Angela and Diane for bringing this book to my attention :)This 5* book is masterfully written, with outstanding character development. That alone would be a great book but there is much more. There is a love story and mystery woven through the story, and add art and poetry to that and you have this incredible book. Well as to the plot I will give you a little information on that, although you\u2019ve all probably read the book blurb. At the beginning of the story we are introduced to Kya, a 6 year old little girl who has already been traumatized for life. Her mother leaves her father and the five children and never returns. Then slowly throughout some years her older siblings leave and then finally her brother whom she was very close to and her drunken father. They leave her completely alone in their falling down shack, no provisions and barely any clothing. She was only 14, she was completely alone and had no idea how to survive, but somehow she does. She has an incredible will and she loves the marsh, it\u2019s the only home she\u2019s known. She learns to fish, cook and clean just by remembering how it used to be. Barkley Cove, where she goes for groceries and gas has a store that is run by an extremely kind and generous couple who have lived on the marsh their entire life. She exchanges mussels and then smoked fish for gas for her motor and a few groceries. Mabel gives her used books, shoes, anything that she can get donated. They were her only friends.Kya has two real love relationships in the book. Tate she has known all of her life but now that she is older she views him differently, she begins to feel real love. He teaches her how to read which opens up the world to her. He is in her life for quite a few years and she seems happy, her life is good. She loves the marsh and all that inhabit it. She collects many things and categorizes them. From the books Tate brings her she learns biology, math, how things grow and change and she is fascinated by the marsh. The author describes the marshland so well I felt myself transported there, felt the humid air, the squashing feel when I walked and encountering all of the creatures described in this book.It\u2019s incredible to think that this could happen but I really think there are those people who live in the marsh. Quoting from the book \u201cthis infamous marsh became a net, scooping up a mishmash of mutinous sailors, castaways, debtors, and fugitives dodging wars, taxes or laws that they didn\u2019t take to. The ones malaria didn\u2019t kill or the swamp didn\u2019t swallow bred into a woodsmen tribe of several races and multiple cultures. .. . . . .two hundred years later, they were joined by runaway slaves, who escaped into the marsh and were called maroons, and freed slaves, penniless and beleaguered, who dispersed into the water-land because of scant options.\"After being disappointed in her relationship with Tate she finally decides that perhaps she could be more trusting. She shares things with Chase, a boy from town who tells her he loves her, talks about a future. But everyone always leaves Kya.Then one especially happy day for Kya, she had met with the publishers of her books, two at this time, but gets an awful message from Jumpin\u2019 upon her return, Chase is dead. The sheriff is looking for Kya and there are rumors in town that perhaps Chase\u2019s death was not an accident.Oh my gosh this review is too long and there is so much more to say. I don\u2019t want to spoil any portion of this gorgeous read. There is beautiful poetry and paintings that I felt I could see. Read this book, you will be wonderfully surprised, entranced and feel great about a book again. Read Kya\u2019s story, she will stay with you a very long time.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley and Edelweiss.", "4.5 all aboard the hype train stars!!!Full review along with a few recipes for a decadent southern fried feast featured on my blog  Recipe and a Read!When Kya Clark is 6 years old, she watches as her mother walks away from her, seemingly without a second thought. With the departure of their matriarch, the Clark family slowly but surely vanishes into the marsh that will become the only family Kya will ever know. Her siblings leave shortly after her mother, leaving Kya alone with her father who negligent at best and abusive at worst. She is left to raise herself, care for her father and their home as she struggles with feelings of abandonment, a deep loneliness and fear that during one of her father\u2019s absences social workers will come whisk her away to the dreaded group home. She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn\u2019t her fault she\u2019d been alone. Most of what she knew, she\u2019d learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored and protected her when no one else would.It\u2019s the 1950\u2019s when we\u2019re given the bulk of Kya\u2019s story and upbringing. To say it was difficult is putting it in the absolute mildest terms. She has no education to speak of, she has no means to make money and she must rely on her whit and the lessons of the marsh and a few kind townspeople. For the most part, people avoid her, don\u2019t let their children play with her, mock and marginalize her. As we see Kya grow, what really shows most brightly for me was her utter resilience. She is one of the strongest and most genuinely likable characters I\u2019ve come across in a long time.While Kya\u2019s story is our main timeline, there is a dual timeline running in 1969 that starts off with the death of town legend and golden boy Chase Andrews. As rumors entrench the town about what could have happened to Chase, what might have happened in his past with Kya things get sticky. Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn\u2019t know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land who caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.This, at it\u2019s heart, is a deeply sad but moving story about a misunderstood girl, about abandonment and loss. However, there are uplifting moments and characters that come into Kya\u2019s life that shed light into her dreary and lonely world - through friendships with a shop owner named Jumpin\u2019 and his wife Mabel, through a boy named Tate who teaches Kya not just how to read but about acceptance and friendship and joy. These two timelines slowly begin to converge upon one another and as it does the true gem of this story becomes apparent: nature and all it\u2019s wonders. I really took my time reading this one, and while it did start off a little slow for me, what never wavered was the truly magnificent prose that Owen deals out with an incredibly deft hand. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever read something so empirically lovely, it\u2019s the type of story that satisfies a need for a reader to love and appreciate language. One of my favorite things I\u2019ve found in many historical fiction novels is the ability of an author to create secondary characters out of things like setting, the time period and in this case, the marsh itself. Kya was bonded to her planet and its life in a way few people are. Rooted solid in this earth. Born of this mother. I\u2019m not sure I quite understood what the term atmospheric meant prior to reading this novel. The marsh, the insects, the birds, the mud and the sand permeate this entire story. It creates a heady need to immerse oneself fully in prose so elegant and indulgent that you can\u2019t help but reflect in awe of the ability to weave such a vivid and emotional story in a way that becomes exceedingly difficult to do it justice with mere words that ultimately fall flat in comparison to what you have just read.I read this with the Traveling Sisters and we all mostly ended up in the same coulee of being enamored with the beautiful writing and development of this story!", "I can\u2019t get over how perfect this book is. The writing grabbed me from literally the first page and kept me entranced. And the story! How can your heart not help but ache for Kya? First her mother leaves, then her siblings, even her ne\u2019er do well father. Left to her own devices by the entire town, she survives without schooling or any aid. The preacher\u2019s wife calls her white trash and hurries her child away from Kya convinced she carries disease. The marsh is a character in its own right. Owens does a magnificent job describing it so that we feel we are there, seeing every plant, bird and insect along with Kya. Owens paints the surroundings just like Kya paints, with a fine brush intent on getting every detail right. There are so many heartbreaking moments in this book. Kya just can\u2019t understand why everyone leaves her. The murder mystery was very well done and I had no clue how it would play out. The suspense was killing me. So, this is my first five star book of 2019. It has everything - beautiful writing, great characters and suspense. Highly recommend it!", "Kya ran to the porch, watching her mother walking down the sandy lane in her fake alligator skin heels, her only going out pair, holding a blue train case. She never wore those heels and she never carried a case. That was the last time Kya saw her Ma. There has been fights before and Ma has left several times but she always came back. Over the next few weeks, Kya's oldest brother and two sisters left too. They were tired of Pa's red faced rages, which started out as shouts, then escalated into fist slugs or backhanded punches.Her Pa had fought Germany in the Second World War. His weekly disability checks were their only income. Her Pa eventually left her too at a very young age and Kya was all by herself. She lived in the marsh all by herself. She went to school once but she was teased and never went back. Steve and Benji saw a body laying in the mud. A man was laying flat on his back. Benji noticed it was Chase Andrews. They ride their bikes fast to the Sheriff's office. They let the sheriff know that they saw Chase Andrews flat out in the swamp under the fire tower. They let him know that he looked dead. The sheriff and the Dr. noticed that there wasn't any footprints near the body. None going toward the stairs or away from the stairs, none around the body and Chase Andrews footprints weren t there either. No footprints were found anywhere. This then turns into a murder mystery.I just loved the setting of this book, in the marsh. I loved the atmosphere and just felt that I was there. The descriptions of the environment, the scenery and nature was just beautiful. I am a bird watcher and loved her descriptions of the birds feathers.I also loved the mystery and suspense also.I really loved her writing style. Her writing was so beautuful. I just wanted to savor it.This was an easy five star rating for me.It just Wowed me.I loved the characters. I loved Kya the best. and felt so bad for her having to live the way that she did at a very young age. she was so intelligent. I loved Tate too, who taught Kya how to read and other subjects. I loved the poetry. I loved Jumpin and Mabel who were heroes.I could go on and on about this book but I could never give it the justice it deserves.One of my favorites for 2018?This was a Traveling Friends read and I thought it was a fantastic discussion. I loved reading this with them.I want to thank Edelweiss, G.P. Putnam's Sons, and Delia Owens for the copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.", "This is an incredibly beautiful novel from Delia Owens, totally immersive, an ode to the natural environment and the marshes in particular. Catherine Danielle Clark, aka Kya, is 6 years old when her mother leaves their shack in the remote wilderness of the North Carolina coastal marshes, next to the town of Barkley Cove. Her family is desperately poor, and before long her siblings follow suit, abandoning her to the care of her alcoholic, neglectful and abusive father, and at 14 years old, he too leaves her for good. Completely isolated, school proves to be a tortuous experience, she stays for only one day, avoiding all attempts by the truant officer and others to bring her back. Kya is the Wild Child, The Marsh Girl, Marsh Trash as far as the residents of Barkley Cove are concerned, directing hate, ridicule, contempt and hurtful prejudice at the bewildered Kya, as she becomes the target of harrassment and attacks, the community dehumanising and shunning her. No-one other than the black Jumpin and his wife, Mabel, offer help or advice to the lonely girl, and they face a barrage of racist attacks and humiliation themselves.Unable to read and write, longing for the return of her mother, Kya desperately desires company, and to belong. For a while, she receives some sustenance in the form of Tate, who looks out for her, teaches her to read and write, and shares Kya's joy in the marsh world with its insects, wildlife, birds, weather and her untethered hold it has on her, collecting ever rare feathers and shells. A close relationship develops between the two of them until he leaves to study marine biology at university. Tate leaving has the effect of chipping away at Kya's inner capacity to trust as she once again finds herself isolated, but her curiosity about the marshes, and her ability to paint all that resides within it, has her pursuing a deeper and more academic knowledge of it. However, she still wants to belong and her burgeoning sexuality and hopes for marriage and family are met with betrayal, treachery and worse. In a narrative that goes back and forth in time from the 1950s to the present of 1969 onwards, where the favoured son of Barkley Cove, the golden boy Chase Andrews is discovered dead by two boys, having fallen from a tower. There is no evidence of murder, but the Sheriff is uneasy, and Andrews\u2019s mother and the town are bursting with rumours of murder so a trial ensues.Owen has written a captivating and mesmerising novel, unforgettable in its vibrant descriptions of the marsh location and the life within it. Juxtaposed with that is the small town of Barkley Cove, indifferent at best, malicious and dangerous at its worst, with none of the spirit of compassion to support a young child forced to find ways to financially survive, emotionally bereft, finding comfort in poetry that lends weight to her inner feelings. Despite all the horrors and struggles she faces, she makes something of herself, something which Barkley Cove refuses to acknowledge. Her profound sensitivity to nature, which proves to be the ultimate educator, shapes Kya's perception of the human behaviour she encounters. The marsh is where she belongs, it and all that it entails is home, everyone else has left her, leaving her exposed and vulnerable when she begins to feel fear. It is barely surprising that when elements of her life begin to shift that she would be wary and distrusting, although buried parts of her harbour tiny sparks of hope. This is simply superb storytelling that winds it way into your heart as I rooted for Kya amidst the barrage of turbulence and heartbreak she endures. Amazing read. Many thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC.", "\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sings\u201d is a rich, well-written novel that, like a good southern meal, left me satisfied and content but not engrossed or astonished as the back cover promised. Maybe I\u2019m a little burned out on young girl coming of age stories having read two others in the prior year. \u201cAll the Ugly and Wonderful Things\u201d was more honest and rawer, and \u201cEducated\u201d was more emotional and more personal, being a memoir. Still, Owens' might be the best writer of the three, and is at her best describing the flora and fauna of the North Carolina wetlands. All three of the books are touted as debut novels (which I guess technically is true), but Owens is already an award-winning and bestselling author of non-fiction wildlife books. Let\u2019s breakdown what I like and didn\u2019t about this novel. Delia Owen\u2019s and her publisher clearly knocked it out of the part with the cover and title. But more important - Owen\u2019s writing is lush and vivid, mostly in setting, but the characters felt fully formed to me as well. The plot was rich, first with a dysfunctional family, then as a survival story, and finally as a murder whodunit. I did like how the author interspersed the beginnings of the murder mystery component in the form of flash forwards, throughout the book, increasing the conflict and intrigue earlier into the book. And while the author left me enough clues to guess the ending, it was engaging until the end. My biggest issue was that the plot was largely predictable. The plot flowing along like a meandering river, not like the twists and turns and tributaries of a dense marsh. The pacing wasn\u2019t bad, but it did get a bit choppy in the middle. I don\u2019t want to leave any spoilers, but let me just say, a few plot points weren\u2019t surprising, but they popped up, out of nowhere, making me feel like I had missed some pages. In addition to the plot, I also never became invested in the characters, maybe because I\u2019m a little burned out on this type of story line. While the swamp and the creatures and the waterways felt real enough to me, the characters themselves, while being well described and true to their motives, didn\u2019t quite pull me in.Big picture, I enjoyed reading the story, never felt bored, but it was as much of the description of the setting and the major plot questions, then it was an emotional investment. A descriptively written, and interestingly plotted story that transitions from a coming of age tale to a murder mystery.", "5 trilling stars to Where the Crawdads Sing! \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f I am super excited to share this review with you because the book is on my favorites list for this year. The writing is lovely, and the storytelling is brilliant.Barclay Cove is a quiet place along the North Carolina coast. I tried to imagine this setting and time period, as someone familiar with the area, and I could not quite fit where it was in reality; however, using the author\u2019s extraordinary gift for description without being overly flowery, in my imagination, I can perfectly picture the mysterious marsh. The book begins with the story of Kya, a young girl whose mother walks out on the family, leaving the children to fend for themselves with an alcoholic father who is absent most of the time. Not to mention the fact that they live in the inhospitable marsh as squatters (there are, indeed, small settlements on the North Carolina coast today that were founded my \u201csquatters\u201d). Kya\u2019s siblings are older, and they flee, leaving her alone with her father. She learns to care for herself at a young age because she has to. Kya is uneducated by choice and circumstance, though the town attempted to get her to attend at first. Even without schooling, she is sharp and caring, as she learns the ways of life through the marsh and all it has to teach her. For years, Kya lives this way and is known as the \u201cMarsh Girl\u201d by the townies. When a young man of the same age is found dead, everyone in town assumes it must have been Kya, and fingers are pointed. She has been involved with two young men who were entranced with her, but was Kya involved in the death of Chase Andrews? Where the Crawdads Sing is a glorious and equally somber coming of age story for Kya. Though she was called to a different life from the one she has always known, how much will her upbringing continue to control who she is? The writing is exquisite, the setting atmospheric on a grand scale, and Kya is a strong and unforgettable character I wanted to hug. Overall, I simply adored this book. I was immersed completely in Kya\u2019s vibrant world, and my heart ached at every turn. The ending is memorable, and the messages are strong. Beautiful nature and a captivating story. Thank you to G.P. Putnam\u2019s Sons for the ARC. All opinions are my own. My reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com", "Stunning, enchanting & emotive!So before I start off with my review there is something that I must confess to. While reading this novel there was always this niggling annoyance in the forefront of my mind telling me that I wasn\u2019t connecting with the third person narrative here. I am not exactly sure what it was for me but that really bothered me that I wasn\u2019t able to give this story my whole heart. Regardless of not connecting with the third person narrative I thought this story and the words written were absolutely beautiful though. And in the end after long discussions with my dear friend, Kris she helped me work out my feelings towards this book and come to a few realizations that were pivotal. I am so happy to say that I was able to get that warm fuzzy feeling that I was so desperately seeking from this book.WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING by DELIA OWENS was an engrossing, moving, heartbreaking and charming coming of age, love story and murder mystery novel all wrapped up into one incredible and delightful story. I was immediately drawn into this quiet and powerful story that revolves around the survival and resilience of an unforgettable young girl named Kya, abandoned at the age of 10 and growing up alone in the marsh. Kya\u2019s story consumed my thoughts and my heart totally while I was reading this novel. She had me laughing, smiling, crying, worried and rooting for her every step of the way. DELIA OWENS delivers an intriguing, atmospheric, suspenseful and beautifully written read here that is so vividly descriptive and absolutely mesmerizing. The descriptions of the marsh and everything that it entails pertains so meaningfully to this story. Unlike Kya, I just wish that it didn\u2019t take me as long to come to that realization of how meaningful the marsh was to her whole being and story.*Traveling Friends Read* This was an awesome group read with an absolutely wonderful discussion and with the help from Brenda and our Traveling Friends I was able to fully enjoy this novel! Thank you friends!  Norma\u2019s Stats:Cover: Eye-catching, beautiful, and an extremely fitting representation to storyline.

But when he reached the lagoon, he stopped under the deep canopy and watched hundreds of fireflies beckoning far into the dark reaches of the marsh. Way out yonder, where the crawdads sing...", "This starts out as a wonderful book well worth a five-start rating. The voice of the coming of age Kya is truly amazing. Had the craft been sustained through to the end of the book this could have easily been compared to, To Kill a Mocking Bird.The setting is marvelous and carries the same weight as a main character. Absolutely wonderful descriptions.The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya, with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder.The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully, the sheriff, not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down. The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful, and done so well it was practically invisible.The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book, however when handling the mystery part of the story, the protagonist doesn\u2019t dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times, and long after the crime has occurred, comes forward and says, \u201cOh, I might have seen something that night. I just didn\u2019t think it was important.\u201d For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided. The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form.I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn\u2019t buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book, the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character, too many points of view. And the use of clich\u00e9\u2019s like \u201cI walked into a door,\u201d and \u201cI jus\u2019 didn\u2019t fall off a turnip truck.\u201d didn\u2019t match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned, or more likely was rushed.The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided), and that there really wasn\u2019t any other possibility, no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn\u2019t twist at the end. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all. So reluctantly I have to give this one four stars instead of a five plus.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series", "Powerful! I'm so happy I read this novel at last! I'd been meaning to do so for some time, but the synopsis was one thing that made me postpone doing so. I was reluctant to read a seemingly depressing book about a little girl who is left by her family to survive on her own, who from the early age witnesses domestic violence and for whom the marsh becomes her mother. I received a copy from the library and I said to myself: it's now or never! And now I'm grateful that my library forced me to get to know Kya at last! I felt for her while reading and I'll remember her incredibly sad and yet beautiful story...... The little girl forms special bond with the wildlife of North Carolina that feeds her and is her only teacher. Kya's innocence is what touched me immensely and the way she perceived the world though her experience.

With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it\u2014in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations\u2014and whose story inspires us to do the same.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528206996l/38746485.jpg", "title": "Becoming", "authors": "Michelle Obama", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming", "reviews": ["I didn\u2019t think I could admire and respect former First Lady Michelle Obama any more than I already did. For eight years she graced our country with her presence, her intellect, her caring. We never had to ask because it is obvious in everything she says and does that she does care. Without a doubt, she cares more than anything about her family, but also cares deeply about this country. Then I read this book, an eloquent memoir, strikingly honest and as inspiring as I suspected it would be. I felt even more admiration and respect for her. She recounts her time growing up on the South Side of Chicago as she shares the joys of her childhood as well as some of the tough things. She was a feisty child, driven to do well in school. Her story begins : \u201cI spent much of my childhood listening to the sound of striving.\u201d She speaks lovingly of her roots in this working class family - her parents and her brother and grandparents and how their values shaped the adult she would become. We witness the grief she experienced over the loss of her father and her continuing admiration and love for her mother who was tenacious in seeking a good education for her children. In this memoir, she is so open and honest and it feels so intimate. Michelle shares her love for her husband and daughters. She speaks about the discrimination against the men in her family, about being black at Princeton, about the attacks on her husband\u2019s citizenship, a conspiracy theory primary pushed by the person who unfortunately followed him after his second term. We discover who she is in the times she is undergoing a self discovery, as she questions her aspirations, as she juggles work and motherhood as Barack\u2019s involvement and aspirations in politics grow. It felt so intimate as she shares some personal struggles that they faced, ones that I don\u2019t think she ever divulged publicly previous to this. The things she chose to focus on as First Lady - children and their health, assisting military families, developing a program for mentoring young women reflect the things that are important to her and the kind of person she is. With an intellect such as hers, she easily could have taken on larger policy issues, but instead focused on children and families bringing people into the White House who would not have had the opportunity to be there if not for her. This book is over 400 pages and it never felt long. The writing is good and I just kept turning page after page always interested in what she would say next. A remarkable story of a remarkable woman.", "\nI\u2019d been lucky to have parents, teachers, and mentors who\u2019d fed me with a consistent, simple message: You matter. As an adult, I wanted to pass those words to a new generation.\nLook, I'm not a happy crier. I might cry at songs about leaving and missing someone; I might cry at books where things don't work out; I might cry at movies where someone dies. I've just never really understood why people get all choked up over happy, inspirational things. But Michelle Obama's kindness and empathy changed that. This book had me in tears for all the right reasons.This is not really a book about politics, though political experiences obviously do come into it. It's a shame that some will dismiss this book because of a difference in political opinion, when it is really about a woman's life. About growing up poor and black on the South Side of Chicago; about getting married and struggling to maintain that marriage; about motherhood; about being thrown into an amazing and terrifying position.I hate words like \"inspirational\" because they've become so overdone and cheesy, but I just have to say it-- Michelle Obama is an inspiration. I had the privilege of seeing her speak at The Forum in Inglewood, and she is one of the warmest, funniest, smartest, down-to-earth people I have ever seen in this world.And yes, I know we present what we want the world to see, but I truly do think it's genuine. I think she is someone who really cares about people - especially kids - and wants to give them better lives and opportunities. She's obviously intelligent, but she also doesn't gussy up her words. She talks straight, with an openness and honesty rarely seen. She's been one of the most powerful women in the world, she's been a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School, she's had her own successful career, and yet she has remained throughout that same girl - Michelle Robinson - from a working class family in Chicago.I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "I\u2019m so thrilled to add Becoming to my list!

I cried - or was teary-eyed so many times - I lost count. THIS BOOK must be \u2018especially\u2019 special to her immediate family and closest friends ....but it\u2019s also a great gift to the rest of us. Nobody else but Michelle could have written this book - it\u2019s so MICHELLE\u2019S STORY! She is gifted in her ability to express her own emotions- write with tremendous insight and sensitivity and from beginning to end it\u2019s artistically rendered with meticulous attention to details. Michelle questioned herself ....was a very hard worker - determined to achieve her goals academically. She wanted to do well. No matter how great she was doing she still had insecurities - doubted herself. She questioned, \u201cam I good enough?\u201dMICHELLE IS GOOD ENOUGH! We are blessed to have her \u2014- simply sharing HERSELF - BEING HERSELF - SHARING ABOUT HER LIFE - HER PARENTS - HER THOUGHTS - FEELINGS - PROJECTS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO HER....HER MARRIAGE - HER DAUGHTERS - HER FAMILY FRIENDS - BEING A WOMAN - BEING BLACK - LESSONS SHE HAS LEARNED AND IS STILL WORKING OUT - HER WARMTH -HER HUMOR- HER HONESTY & HUMANITY - etc. etc. etc. MICHELLE IS A NATURAL LEADER - A PRESENCE WE ARE DRAWN TO - CAN WE LOVE A PUBLIC FIGURE MUCH MORE? Perhaps.... but it\u2019s very easy to love Michelle Obama ..... For me.....It would be fun just to sit with my friends over drinks and yummy treats for a few hours and all pick this book apart \u2014- sharing our favorite parts - AS THERE ARE MANY ***FAVORITE*** parts!!!! I\u2019m happy to host a gathering at my house anytime!!! \ud83d\ude0aMichelle has made it clear - she is never running for office. If you listened to this audiobook for 19 hours - every word - such as I did - I guarantee you won\u2019t doubt her \u2018never running\u2019 announcement. She will contribute her way! Politics is nasty and mean and it\u2019s not the place for her.... she doesn\u2019t hold back in expressing how she feels about it either. I can\u2019t blame her. At the same time it was quite beautiful how she totally understands her husbands brilliant mind and vision - how Barack was the perfect candidate at the perfect time. Oh she would\u2019ve rather had Obama a regular family man, but he was the type of man she herself would have wanted for President. She grew into becoming comfortable with his running.They did well overall....as husband and wife and as parents while also being in the life of politics --living in the white house with security guards everywhere they went. Michelle raised two daughters in the White House as normal as she could. A frightening story about wild sedated animals will having you saying .....\u201cWhat the f#@k\u201d? But have no fear .....the story ends well. :)Many memories came flooding back around Barack\u2019s campaign and Election Day. I was teary eye during much of this part. Parts I remembered well - other personal circumstances that Michelle had to share about the campaign, I knew nothing about. Much made me sad and angry - Election Day had my nerves stirred all over again ... only this time I was more intimately with the Obama family. The beginning of this Audiobook.....we find Michelle at home....home alone. Not at the White House. She was no longer the First Lady. Simply a night alone in her own house. None of us readers have lived in the White House - but she shares a story that most readers will connect with. It\u2019s priceless, moving, and powerful. I suggest taking a moment to reflect on your \u2018own\u2019 similar experience. I\u2019m sure a memory will surface! Enjoy it. A moment of solitude. If you like cheese toast - this might be a time to have a slice. Michelle spends a long time telling us about her early childhood. I questioned \u2018parts\u2019 of this for awhile - I wasn\u2019t sure why I needed to know sooooo many details. But - during a break from listening to the audiobook is when I did some serious reflecting. My feelings changed from feeling a little impatient - as in \u201chow much more do I need about the family games you played in the evening, or details about kids in the neighborhood- and every description of your house - your aunt Robbie\u2019s personality, your grandpas carpentry skills, etc. ...how much more of this Michelle?\u201d....But then.....during my break ....( my first cry).... I understood my own and impatience . The light went off for me of why this portion of the book was valuable to me and also triggering. Michelle taught me things in this book about being black \u2014- really being black \u2014 not just a woman and black \u2014 but what she went through all her life as a very hard working BLACK women WHO ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP REACHING - achievement oriented- her goals were important to her. Being one of the few blacks within mostly a white environment for soooo many years was a constant pressure. Her years at Princeton really shows what she went through.I learned something else from Michelle too .....Things about her \u2018family\u2019 - her parents - the tight knit ways they all were with one another - her incredible love for he older brother ..... and even though Michelle was black and lived on the south side of Chicago ..... she had things that I never had my childhood. She had two parents who were deeply dedicated to her and her brother Craig. Her parents gave up so much of their own lives to provide everything for their children. I literally fell apart with gushing tears during my break - I didn\u2019t have a childhood anything close to hers. When I returned to listening to the Audiobook\u2014 Michelle was still talking about how wonderful her mom was and dad were, their family car - the Buick - family time *together*.....SO MUCH FAMILY TIME - HAPPY MEMORIES.....something shifted in me. I didn\u2019t want rush her childhood any longer. I wanted to try to imagine the type SHE HAD. Once I stopped fighting my uncomfortableness - I was transforming through \u2018her\u2019 family. When Michelle hit her teenage years, I was a little envious. I wanted to be girlfriends with her. I liked her. Hanging out at her house after school - meeting her mom and those gracious sandwiches her mom prepared for Michelle and her girlfriends was just cozy wonderful. I was reminded how much I loved my close friends - Renee, Lisi, and Barbara. Great girlfriends during the teen years makes life so much more tolerable and \u2018fun\u2019. I wanted to be friends with Michelle.....feel safe in her home......cherished her mom and dad too. It was impossible not to fall in love with not only Michelle - but her parents - brother Craig - Susan ( Michelle\u2019s best friend in college), and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, My affinity was also warm for people who supported their family in the White House. Also for Michelle\u2019s female colleagues from her work at City Hall in Chicago ....and of course Barack Obama. Barack gets \u2018guy-of-the-year\u2019 award - the night he asked Michelle to marry her. GREAT STORY!Let\u2019s face it ..... Barack & Michelle are adorable!! Bright - have dignity - are gracious!They undeniably love each another. They had challenges..... but as a committed couple they practiced, learn, and got better over time figuring out what empowered their relationship - and what didn\u2019t. They were not too proud to attend therapy for support ( and Michelle was not too proud to share with the world to read). They looked for solutions - rather than attacked - found fault and blamed. Barack and Michelle are grounded in love - willing to support each individually as whole separate beings. They are also emotionally connected in matters of the heart. They may have had a challenging relationship - logistics alone - but a healthy love relationship based on respect and trust. Yep.... they are a couple much like Paul and I. \u2764\ufe0fMichelle and Barack\u2019s wedding with their \u2018wedding song\u2019 by Stevie Wonder ....\u201cYou and I Can Conquer The World\u201d.....was such a beautiful part of this story.... MY GOD....at one point I said to myself, \u201cthey really are a fairy tale couple\u201d.....lolI usually ever even \u2018think\u2019 like that. .....but their wedding did feel beautiful.....surrounded by many people who loved them both. The only thing that would have made the wedding scene better would have been ......If on the Audiobook....they played Stevie Wonder singing the song. It\u2019s soooo beautiful!!! Sing \ud83c\udfa4 along ....\u201dYou and I Can Conquer The World\u201d. Who knows what \u201cWilly Worm\u201d is? Michelle mentioned she was rushing off to Willy Worm class with Sasha when she was a toddler....and I said, \u201cwhat the heck is that?\u201d... look it up....it\u2019s cute. Might drive adults nuts, though. \ud83d\udc1bI loved hearing about Michelle\u2019s high school AND college years.....Yet I felt angry \u2018with\u2019 her that years later during the Barack Obama campaign, somebody dug up an old paper that Michelle wrote when she was at Princeton as a young college student and wrote nasty things saying she was a black radical. So much UGLY news of pure crappy political lies were being spread about her during the campaign.Fox News talked about her militant anger - and she was accused of calling white people whities. Total lies - outlandish hurtful lies that exhaustive Michelle. And who could blame? All the while Michelle was trying to be positive and supportive. Michelle has contributed to other potential first ladies by writing this book. Michelle was more active than many spouses of candidates in campaigning for their husbands\u2026 But in the future we will see more of this. For over a year Michelle had zero support from the Obama campaign team. Nobody supported her. She wasn\u2019t getting any speech writing experts. Apparently, while Michelle was campaigning - traveling from state to state - not with Obama - everything was going great until all of a sudden it wasn\u2019t. Things turned ugly and hurtful fast. This part of the book gives useful information that others can learn from. Any future wife of a candidate running for President in the future could get an awful lot of value out of reading this portion of the shelves memoir. I\u2019m sorry Michelle paid a painful price ....but she paved the way of possibilities to help \u2018both sides\u2019 of wives of running candidates in the future. It\u2019s hard to finish this book without any tears. I totally love both Michelle and Barack. So many of us are heartbroken with where our country is now .....This book comes at a good time. It\u2019s a great holiday gift! A cute moment...Michelle learned early in childhood that she could discuss things with her parents. Her parents would listen to her ideas...Even debating was allowed. She was little. She asked her mother one day, \u201cwhy do we eat eggs in the morning?\u201dThat led to a discussion about the value of protein. So Michelle thought about it and did a little research and realize that peanut butter had protein. She likes Peanut butter, but she didn\u2019t like eggs. So she was able to negotiate. For the next nine years she had a thick peanut butter sandwich every morning for breakfast and never ate an egg again. Years later a college counselor was the opposite of listening to Michelle. The woman didn\u2019t value who she was ( a MERIT SCHOLAR - top 10% of her graduating class),..... she told Michelle she wouldn\u2019t be \u201c Princeton material\u201d. Michelle will slowly getting stronger and believing in herself.... but was definitely vulnerable and sensitive to a feeling inside of not being good enough. But that day she decided she was going to at least apply to Princeton..... she went and got her recommendation letter from a great neighbor who also worked at the school. She never talk to that counselor again....In other words she wasn\u2019t the woman she celebrated with when she was accepted.Michelle Robinson Obama - is helping breakdown those prejudices just by speaking out - her voice is powerful - she\u2019s more than good enough! She\u2019s A GIFT TO OUR COUNTRY.....a woman who continues to be true to herself - making a difference being who she is .....just keep her sharing!", "\nThe tears...oh the tears running down my face.Check out my video 5 Books that *Actually* Made Me Cry  for all the juicy details.  Thanks for watching. Oh. This was perfect. Review to comeYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads\n", "\"I was humbled and excited to be First Lady, but not for one second did I think I'd be sliding into some glamorous, easy role. Nobody who has the words 'first' and 'black' attached to them ever would. I stood at the foot of the mountain, knowing I'd need to climb my way into favor.\"God, do I miss the Obamas.Since I've had the right to vote, two presidents have energized and excited me\u2014Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. That's not to say that I agreed with everything they did, or that there weren't times when they disappointed me. But in both cases, their candidacy and then their campaigns for re-election motivated me enough to volunteer, excited me enough to be fraught with nerves as election results came in, gave me cause for celebration, and left me sad when their terms ended.Reading Michelle Obama's new memoir, \nBecoming\n, reminded me of those times. It also reminded me just what a fan I've been of hers since watching her and her daughters when President Obama declared his candidacy for the White House almost 12 years ago, since hearing her speak at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. I was always wowed by the sheer joy she appeared to have for the job of First Lady, despite the overwhelming amount of cruelty she and her family were subjected to throughout her husband's two terms as President.With \nBecoming\n, she gives you a glimpse into her childhood and her relationship with her parents, which definitely impacted the way she carried herself throughout her life and how she raised her two daughters. It tells of her ambitions, her desire to help make the world a better place (one clearly shared by her husband), the challenges of marriage and motherhood, and how she dealt with her husband's political ambitions. She talks of her desire to make an impact as First Lady while at the same time ensuring her daughters' lives were as \"normal\" as they could possibly be, and the successes, frustrations, and disappointments she experienced.I love the matter-of-fact way she shares her feelings and experiences, revealing emotions and fears and moments of anger, as well as the moments of sheer joy, as mother, as wife, as daughter, and as First Lady. While she certainly reveals instances when she felt she wasn't treated fairly by the media or by those unhappy with her husband (or her), this isn't a tell-all book. She is critical of those that deserve her scorn, but even when she didn't see eye to eye with people, she didn't tear them to pieces.For the most part, the Michelle Obama you've seen at public appearances, on television shows, and in photos, is the Michelle Obama you get in \nBecoming\n. And that feels just right. This is a woman who loves her life, loves her country, and most importantly, loves her husband, her children, and her family. She doesn't overinflate her importance or her contributions as First Lady but she realizes she held a position few women have through history, and to be the first black woman to be First Lady made her a role model in the eyes of so many. It may have been a position she wasn't always comfortable with, but it is a role in which she absolutely shone.\"For me, becoming isn't about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn't end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to and be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person. I have become, by certain measures, a person of power, and yet there are moments when I still feel insecure or unheard. It's all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there's more growing to be done.\"There was much to enjoy about this book, much to think about, and much to savor. And, at least for me, much to reminisce about.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.", "Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I\u2019m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn\u2019t say \u201cverified purchaser\u201d next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she\u2019ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-\tPg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface \u201cworking-class black student in a fancy mostly white college\u201d-\tPg. 17, chapter 2 \u201cI liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady\u201d. Why does her being white matter?-\tPg. 20, chapter 2, \u201cMy friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent\u201d. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-\tPg.44, chapter 4, \u201cMr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.\u201d Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-\tPg. 71, \u201cmostly white students\u201d Context? History? Why did this matter?-\tPg. 74, \u201cone of the few nonwhite\u201d -\tPg. 74, \u201cmy two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice\u2026\u201d Again, who cares if they were white?-\tPg. 75, \u201cCznery was a smart and beautiful black woman\u201d. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn\u2019t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-\tPg. 120, \u201cNow that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.\u201d I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said \u201cother than make and white\u201d got a lot under my skin (remember I\u2019m not white).-\tPg. 148, \u201cHe was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend\u201d Ok, those white people again.-\tPg. 148, \u201cIn a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago\u2019s famous cronyism.\u201d The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-\tPg. 205, \u201cOur counselor\u2014Dr.Woodchurch, let\u2019s call him\u2014was a soft-spoken white man who\u2019d gone to good school and always wore khakis\u201d. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-\tPg. 208, \u201cThe nervousness of white people\u201d. Sigh.-\tPg. 218, \u201cIts whiteness and maleness\u201d. \u2026Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I\u2019m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I\u2019m not black and I was born in the 80\u2019s and not the 60\u2019s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don\u2019t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I\u2019m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-\tPg. 96. \u201cWhat struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,\u201d-\t\u201cInstead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy\u201d pg. 97-\t\u201cBarack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.\u201d Pg. 97-\t\u201cI found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.\u201d Pg. 97-\t\u201cBarack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.\u201d Pg. 99-\t\u201cThere was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.\u201d Pg.99-\t\u201cHe was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn\u2019t yet know where it would lead.\u201d Pg. 101-\t\u201cBarack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.\u201d Pg. 103-\t\u201cHe had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone\u2014from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He\u2019s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.\u201d Pg. 105-\t\u201cHaving sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn\u2019t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody\u2019s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him\u2014this strange mix-of-everything man.\u201d Pg. 105-\t\u201cBarack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I\u2019d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn\u2014unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I\u2019d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why\u201d. Pg. 111-\t\u201cThis, I was learning, was how Barack\u2019s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I\u2019d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.\u201d Pg. 112-\t\u201cI was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.\u201d Pg.117-\t \u201cAnd now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.\u201d Pg. 123-\t\u201cAll this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack\u2019s strong sense of purpose\u2014sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it\u2014was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.\u201d Pg.131-\tFor better or worse, I\u2019d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. \u201cWe can handle this, right?\u201d he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. \u201cWe\u2019re strong and we\u2019re smart, and so are our kids. We\u2019ll be just fine. We can afford this.\u201d Pg.224I\u2019ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-\tShe told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-\tHer dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-\tShe had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-\tShe smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-\tShe failed the bar exam the first time around-\tShe very much dislikes politics-\tShe had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-\tShe had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-\tHer kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-\tShe tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don\u2019t know if she is always successful.-\tShe graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can\u2019t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn\u2019t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I\u2019d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle\u2019s life in one word is would be \u201cbusy\u201d and one word to describe Michelle herself would be \u201cworkaholic\u201d. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself \"who cares?\". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say \u201cyeah, I read that book\u201d. That being said, it isn\u2019t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people\u2019s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.\tAs a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn\u2019t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they\u2019ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. \tTwo, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn\u2019t that good. I didn\u2019t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my \u201cidentity\u201d but I had to otherwise I just would\u2019ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the \u201cidentity\u201d of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn\u2019t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn\u2019t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.", "I just finished this PHENOMENAL book\u2013seriously, probably THE best autobiography I\u2019ve ever laid my hands on! It\u2019s now in vogue\u2013the coolest new trend\u2013for people to write a book about their lives, and I respect that trend for allowing us to read more TRUE, REAL stories about REAL people. BUT, Becoming is the first autobiography I\u2019ve ever felt I\u2019ve truly connected with, learned from and became a better person for having read it. Within these pages, I both saw myself and re-found myself within Michelle Obama\u2019s narrative; I saw myself in her story and have truly learned a few life changing lessons from this 421-page journey she\u2019s shared with us. It is a rare thing, indeed, for me to be able to say that about any book\u2014that I identified with the words, felt the words in a heartfelt way and came away changed because of those series of words on a page that had been so thoughtfully and candidly laid out. I had the honor of going to see Michelle Obama on her book tour at her Washington D.C. stop the Sunday after Thanksgiving. (In an ironic full circle of events in my experience with this book, I went to see her speak with a friend I met here on Goodreads who has become a very close friend of mine.) Michelle Obama was\u2026everything. She was witty and frankly hilarious; she was open and forthright; she was graceful and dignified, a true orator and inspiration.The tickets to this event sold out within hours--a completely filled arena, pictured above as it is starting to fill.Both in her book and in her talks, she speaks openly about what it was like to be a young black girl from the South Side of Chicago\u2014during the time when whites were fleeing the area and poverty seemed to be creeping its way in\u2014to becoming a young woman at Princeton, unsure of her footing in the new social climate but still clinging to her rigidly drawn-up plan and schedule for her life (of which becoming First Lady was never a part).I\u2019d constructed my existence carefully, tucking and folding every loose and disorderly bit of it\u2026I had labored over its creation. I was proud of how it looked. But it was delicate. If one corner came untucked, I might discover that I was restless. If another popped loose, it might reveal I was uncertain about the professional path I\u2019d so deliberately put myself on, about all the things I told myself I wanted.She walks us through graduating from college and enduring the loss of one of her best friends to an aggressive cancer at the young age of 26 years old and how this changed her outlook on the world and her path through it. Within these pages you\u2019ll learn how she first met Barack Obama, a man who would change her world and ours in so many ways\u2014how he arrived at work late that first day she was to mentor him, wet from the rainy day outside but still sure of himself and confident in a way that spoke of humility. From IVF to being a senator\u2019s wife to the horrible shock of how dirty and personal politics can turn, Michelle Obama gives us an insightful glimpse into her journey into and out of the White House, her personal trek into becoming the icon she is today\u2014a label she still humbly finds bewildering but that she has learned to hone for the betterment of our nation and the society-focused programs she has championed.Throughout it all, Michelle Obama\u2019s outlook is optimistic, her voice clear, witty, candid and insightful. How did she feel the first time she experienced life inside of the presidential motorcade? What fears did she have of exposing her daughters to the \u201cmaw\u201d of public life? And how did she accommodate her outlook on politics \u2013I\u2019ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that. I continue to be put off by the nastiness\u2014the tribal segregation of red and blue, this idea that we\u2019re supposed to choose one side and stick to it, unable to listen and compromise, or sometimes even to be civil.\u2013and her negative experience within the whirlwind of it\u2014A Fox news chyron referred to me as \u201cObama\u2019s Baby Mama,\u201d conjuring cliched notions of black-ghetto America, implying an otherness that put me outside even my own marriage. I was getting worn out, not physically, but emotionally. The punches hurt, even if I understood that they had little to do with who I really was as a person. It was as if there were some cartoon version of me out there wreaking havoc, a woman I kept hearing about but didn\u2019t know\u2014a too-tall, too-forceful, ready-to-emasculate Godzilla of a political wife named Michelle Obama.\u2013to achieve what she has, and with such grace, for our nation, the Democratic party, for children and for people (girls and women especially) of color?Just as the discerning look at the viciousness of American politics will enrage you and make you question the leaders we\u2019ve elected to power, so will Michelle Obama\u2019s experience with the other side of her First Lady journey, the experience with the purity of spirit of genuinely good people\u2014no matter their political affiliations, nationality or socio-economic status\u2014move you.One day in San Antonio, Texas, I noticed a minor commotion in the hallway of the military hospital I was visiting. Nurses shuffled urgently in and out of the room I was about to enter. \u201cHe won\u2019t stay in bed,\u201d I heard someone whisper. Inside, I found a broad-shouldered young man from rural Texas who had multiple injuries and whose body had been severely burned. He was in clear agony, tearing off the bedsheets and trying to slide his feet to the floor. It took us all a minute to understand what he was doing. Despite his pain, he was trying to stand up and salute the wife of his commander in chief.As I read Becoming, I HAD to read it with a pen and highlighter in hand, hence why it took me so long to complete it. I had to savor every word, go back and re-read passages. Just today, as I was nearing the epilogue, a woman sitting next to me asked, \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d I turned the book over and told her, \u201cMichelle Obama\u2019s Becoming.\u201d I hope that gives you an idea of the intensity and connection with which I read this book. To say that I highly recommend this book to any and everyone\u2014especially to American women, women of color and people who have felt persecuted or \u201cothered\u201d by their upbringings or the color of their skin\u2014would be a clear understatement. There is so much truth and integrity and raw emotion to be pointed out in this autobiography, but to do so here would be to write a whole book about the marvels of this book. What I will say is that Becoming earned an easy 5 stars before I\u2019d even finished the preface and continued in its discerning excellence thereafter. There is truly something within these pages for everyone because, as Michelle Obama so elegantly states:I\u2019m an ordinary person who found herself on an extraordinary journey. In sharing my story, I hope to help create space for other stories and other voices, to widen the pathway for who belongs and why\u2026It\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s not about where you get yourself in the end. There\u2019s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there\u2019s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.

The book talks about her roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign, and her role as a mother. The book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More. Become Me, traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago, through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. Becoming Us, departs from the beginning of their romantic relationship and follows their marriage, the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States. Becoming More, describes their life as First Family.\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627: \u00ab\u0634\u062f\u0646\u00bb\u061b \u00ab\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0644 \u0627\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0645\u0627

It was fascinatingly riveting, intriguing, inspirational, powerful, moving! It\u2019s so hard to find role models in our modern world because the appearance, faking, imitation, being artificial are the main values to find some place at the upper level. (The system pushes you kiss more ass to become a winner.)Instead of being honorable first lady, Ms. Obama always attract attention with her fight for social issues even though how controversial, unconventional and challenging they were which made her iconic figure. She is unique. She loves greens, she loves to exercise, she loves to dance. She is different from the other first ladies we\u2019ve been introduced throughout the centuries, isn\u2019t she? I cannot imagine so of them dance with Jimmy Fallon at his late night show or play soccer team of James Corden.Let\u2019s get a closer look st the book: It is divided into 3 main chapters: \u201cBecoming Me\u201d is about early childhood and family life of Obama at South Side of Chicago. Not a wealthy, easy childhood and at young age she loses her father who suffered from multiple sclerosis. But also we see her ambition, success at her school years and take a close look to her education at Princeton and Harvard Universities. Then she starts to work at Sidley Austin and meets with Mr. Barack Obama.The second part: \u201cBecoming Us\u201d; my favorite part of the book. Lately I read so many silly, nonsense romance books. Everything about them was extra far- fetched. But when I read something that directly captivates my heart and makes you feel for the couple, I know that I\u2019m in the right tracks. Their love story excited me. It made me smile and sigh several times. Actually I made so many \u201cawww\u201d voices that my husband thought I was watching \u201cLove Actually\u201d for hundredth time. So yes, it was real, it melt my heart and I loved the parts about their marriage. And yes, this part also tells us Barack Obama\u2019s political carrier and ends with the election night in 2008! Yes he was elected President of the United States.I actually liked the story about Obamas \u2018 giving up the corporate law to do something meaningful. You know they can easily pay the humongous, terrifying student loans with making an impressive amount of money by working as corporate lawyers. And the final part is \u201cBecoming More\u201d tells us the first family life.Overall: I enjoyed this memoir. It is one of my fastest, impressing, touching readings. I loved Michelle Obama\u2019s two quotes that really work as my life mottos which are:\u201cChoose people who lift you up\u201d and \u201cFind people who will make you better\u201dThankfully I did. And I loved this book. I\u2019d better read more memoirs.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "I'm surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this. I was engrossed the whole time and even teared up at some parts. Even when I wasn't reading the book, I was still thinking about Michelle Obama's story. I loved that rather than a rehashed Wiki article of her successes, this was a reflective coming-of-age story that will be inspiring to so many women and people of color who are struggling to find themselves. I loved experiencing Michelle's life alongside her with all her triumphs and heartbreaks. She gives insight not only to what her experiences were like in the White House, but also why she chose certain initiatives during her time as FLOTUS, and how her childhood and upbringing added to her perspective. I especially loved that for all the success she\u2019s had, she always brings it back to how there are so many other kids out there possible of change who just needed the right guidance and opportunities. Her perspective is valuable and very much needed. I was moved hearing her story, and very much appreciate the reminder that even in a bleak country, there are good human beings out there.", "5/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3ame: *screaming through a megaphone and a microphone* I LOVE MICHELLE OBAMA SHE\u2019S MY PRESIDENTI am not even American LOL but I\u2019d still vote for Michelle at pretty much anything to be completely honest.BACK TO THE ACTUAL REVIEWThere is not much I could discuss this book, because everything I could possibly say lays already between the pages of it, so I would make this quick because this is the most important idea of my review: I LOVE MICHELLE OBAMA, thanks for coming to my TED Talk, have a fine day.\nBecoming\n is the complex road Life chose for Michelle to go to and the story of how she became who she is now: a woman of integrity, loved by so many and who inspires towards kind purposes in life. Michelle is a superhero of a nation. But she is just so much more than that. She is a normal person with normal habits, dreams and aspirations, with a ludic nature and a nice sense of humour. She's a fabulous mother to her daughters, a fabulous wife and friend to her husband, a fabulous daughter to her parents. Michelle Obama inspires. Maybe she doesn\u2019t realise it. Or maybe she does. She talks about things that bother her, raising an alarm to the rest of the world. Talking about racism, feminism, health issues, poverty, even peace, Michelle inspires with her words because if she likes it or not, her words weigh. I take off my hat for this incredible, real-life Wonder Woman and I take the liberty to say only this: even though I have no direct connection whatsoever with anything this woman has ever done in her life, I just feel the need to say THANK YOU MICHELLE LAVAUGHN ROBINSON OBAMA FOR EVERYTHING YOU\u2019VE DONE FOR THIS WORLD AND THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING A NEW GENERATION! Thank you for inspiring me. I owe you one in heaven (supposing that I even get there LOL). (x)", "This isn\u2019t so much a review as it is a tiny opportunity to thank the book gods for all the opportunities reading and books have given me. Getting to meet and share time with Michelle Obama was one of the craziest highlights of my professional life and speeding through this book to finish it in time will always be one of the funniest reading experiences I\u2019ve ever had. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "\nAbsolutely stunning in every possible way.

She exemplifies all of the qualities I admire most: beauty, elegance, honor, kindness, intelligence and dignity. To say that I miss the Obamas is an understatement. Going into this read, I knew I would be emotional.  Truth be told, that didn\u2019t begin to describe my reaction to hearing Michelle Obama\u2019s words, her thoughts and learning about her, a good portion of which I\u2019m ashamed to admit, I didn\u2019t know. The former first lady\u2019s humble beginnings, her close knit family, her education and her accomplishments, they simply blew me away. Princeton, Harvard, working at and forming Non-Profits (not to mention her accomplishments as the First Lady!): I am awestruck by you Michelle Obama. The moment Michelle meets Barack Obama when he summers at Sidney Austin, the law firm she is an Associate at, she feels it. That spark. My eyes filled, they glossed over, the tears fell. The two shared an ice cream cone and became an us. (Here, listening to this, I admit to sobbing, heavily). The inflection and enthusiasm in Michelle Obama\u2019s voice, her feelings of love for this man, it is so evident. We saw them every day for 8 years. Such sweet romance, pure pure love and complete respect for each other and their relationship. Oh how I love them. Oh how I miss them.From life in politics, campaigning, being bullied, becoming the First Lady and raising Malia and Sasha in the White House, Michelle Obama gives an honest portrayal of what life was like for her and Barack Obama. While in the White House, the President always made time for family. Always having dinner with them. Never discussing politics. Family was their bond. Yet his love for this Nation was and is still evident.There were so many moments while listening to this audiobook that I teared up. Not just teared up, but sobbed uncontrollably.  Her words, her voice, her thoughts struck a chord, for a myriad of reasons, some sad, some happy. I tear up just thinking about them. Michelle Obama memoir is about \u201cBecoming\u201d - her life\u2019s journey, the amazing part of course, is that it never ends. Her final message is one of hope, of letting people in, and helping others. I received it. Thank you to Michelle Obama for sharing your life with us. I am honored. Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 12.8.18.Excerpt to be published on Instagram.", "4.5 stars!!I\u2019ve had Becoming pre-ordered since I saw it was coming out. I was so excited to read it. Per my Amazon account, I purchased The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama in early 2007. When I read this book, I was moved and hoped this man would be president one day. When I was in my early 20\u2019s, I volunteered for his 2008 campaign. My point is, I\u2019ve always loved the Obamas, but I never knew much about Michelle. After reading this book, I feel like I know so much more. Her story is inspiring, fascinating, and I adore her.If you\u2019re going to read this book, I can\u2019t recommend the audio book enough. Michelle herself narrates it and I always love when authors narrate their own stories. It makes them that more personal and captivating. I loved reading about her past, her family, and of course when she met Barack and their story. I could relate to some of her story and learned a lot of new things about her. This was a fantastic autobiography and I can\u2019t recommend it enough!", "\nYou bet your ass I just preordered this. As a female minority, Queen First Lady Michelle Obama has become one of my most go-to role models, and I already know I'm going to be in tears while reading this.\n", "\nThank you, Michelle Obama, for all you've done.\n", "Michelle Obama Give Me A Hug And Tell Me Everything Is Going To Be Okay 2k19.One of my greatest wishes is for the entirety of my thought process to be narrated - if not controlled - by Michelle Obama.

Knowing full well that I would be swept up in the wave that surrounded the recent release of Michelle Obama\u2019s memoirs, I vowed to take some time to read them, partially to offset some of the alarming pieces about current events in DC. Obama seeks not to define herself as FLOTUS (First Lady of the United States), but rather Michelle Obama (n\u00e9e Robinson), taking the reader as far back as she can remember. Obama sets the stage for the reader with a solid recounting of her life on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1960s. In an era rattled by race wars, she remembers her parents forced to pinch pennies and living with relatives, while the world around them tried to come to terms with racial integration. Working hard in school and always striving to excel, Obama remembers gaining a spot at Princeton, where her older brother was already attending. There, she learned the power of community and helping others, a theme that repeats itself throughout the memoir. After leapfrogging into Harvard Law School\u2014again, through hard work and merit\u2014Obama was able to settle back in Chicago at a law firm. Here, she met an ever-tardy and somewhat esoteric Barrack Hussein Obama, whose basic living was something to which Michelle could relate, though they clashed considerably in their approaches to organization. Barrack and Michelle soon began a courtship that led to marriage and the introduction of politics into the equation. Barrack was a community organiser who was being touted for more, first a State Senate seat and then all the way to Congress. While Michelle was never fond of the political arena, she argues throughout the middle of the memoir about how she could never stand in the way of her husband\u2019s ambitions. The Obamas welcomed two girls into their lives, doubling the size of their family and bringing new meaning to work ethic. Michelle struggled with this, as well as being a wife/mother while her husband was away a great deal, though the reader will see much change throughout, as the girls got older. The last great transformation for Michelle was her husband\u2019s choice to seek the White House. If she struggled before, the campaign showed her new issues and concerns, as exhibited through a number of lenses. The Obamas worked hard and utilised their fresh message approach to reach the political pinnacle, but that was only the beginning. In wonderfully fluid narratives, Michelle Obama depicts life inside the White House and roles of the First Family, inviting the reader to explore some of her most personal thoughts as initiatives, bills, summits, and security decisions shaped America at break-neck speed. Even when the time came to leave, Michelle refused to turn off and fade into the background, arguing that there was still much life to live, as can be seen with the publication of this book. Stunning in its frankness and refusal to shrink out of sight, Michelle Obama offers readers a refreshing look at a woman\u2019s life who was shaped by her life experiences, but refused to be defined by the man who stood beside her. Recommended for those who love memoirs, politics, coming of age, and anything uplifting, which is sure to offset much of the sludge that Washington is spewing out these days!There have been many notable First Ladies in the last number of years, all of whom left their own marks on America. However, I can think of only one who stood out and sought to define herself independent of the role her husband brought as President of the United States. That thought came to mind before I began this book, though now that I am on the flip side, I can see that Michelle Obama was more than \u2018wife of\u2019, but rather a woman of great importance in her own regard. Michelle Obama refuses\u2014throughout and in many scenarios\u2014to allow herself to be defined as simply a member of a group. She is not just a woman, an African American, a mother, a First Lady. This memoir catapulted many of the views I had of Obama and helped me see the woman who sought to fight for equality years before she made headlines, who advocated for others decades before healthy snacks in schools became an initiative, and who loved life to its fullest before being thrust before the cameras. In essence, Michelle Obama became many things on her life journey, hence the aptly chosen title. As the memoir argues so effectively, there was more to the woman than being a spouse and mother, tending house while Barrack Obama rose to power. Without Michelle, there would have been no winning campaigns, but not because she stumped or smiled for the cameras. It was her passion and dedication to the kernel of the Obama family that saw these four people become firsts in many things and helped America realise its greatness. Being able to tear down walls, rather than build them; communicate passionately, rather than attack venomously, Michelle Obama forged the cornerstone of the legacy she wishes to leave the world. Let it never be forgotten that beside every decent man is a fundamentally stupendous woman and the brilliance of the words in this book give new meaning to this. When I speak of brilliance and earth-shattering aspects of this memoir, I refer not only to the wonderful prose and sound vignettes that rise from page upon page, but also the shards left to twinkle in the sunlight, as the reader notices just how many glass ceilings Michelle Obama was able to break in her life, paving the way for other women to follow her.Kudos, Madam Obama, for one of the most enthralling memoirs I have read in a long time. I am stunned, in awe, and so happy I took the time to get to know you better. Thank you for making the world a better place by being an active part of it!Like/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at: http://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/A Book for All Seasons, a different sort of Book Challenge: https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...", "Becoming is a memoir of a famous person, Michelle Obama, the first black First Lady in the United States who lived with her husband, President Barack Obama, and their two daughters, Malia and Sacha in the White House for eight years. During that time, alongside taking care of her family, Michelle Obama managed to accomplish four major initiatives as First Lady to help improve people\u2019s lives and well-being.The first thing that struck me when I was partway into the book is how her background and her first years resonated so strongly. She is relatable, plain and simple. I could relate to her and her experiences as a woman, yet there is no doubt in my mind that a great deal of her story will also resonate with men. On a personal level, partway through the book I went online and discovered that Michelle Obama\u2019s birthday is 3 days before my Dad\u2019s, and Barack Obama\u2019s birthday is the same day as my Mom\u2019s. Regardless of color, religion, sex, age, or any of the other \u2018discriminators\u2019 that still cling to our so-called advanced societies, each one of us makes our way into the world with a desire to accomplish something. Whether those accomplishments take place on a very small scale or a large scale matters not. Whether those accomplishments are on the dark side, the low road of stepping on top of others to gain lift matters a lot.It is the attitude of optimism and gratitude for our lives and opportunities that drives us to make a positive impact. We also somehow magnetize the mentors we need to help us along the way. This is the story of a woman who came from very humble beginnings and spent the largest part of her life in the cause of elevating others into a better life because she, too, had positive mentors and people who showed her possible doors and helped her to open them. From my perspective, it was during this process of passing along the good she experienced in her life that her own life became more elevated, too.I can\u2019t even count the number of times that tears came to my eyes while reading Michelle Obama\u2019s story. Tears of recognition and empathy, but also because her story touched my heart over and over again in incident after incident, and event after event.At one point, I was reading along as Michelle Obama described their eldest daughter Malia\u2019s 10th Birthday \u2013 a July 4th day in the midst of the high-tension campaign that Barak Obama was involved in. Near the end of their long day of campaigning, participating in the town\u2019s July 4th celebrations, talking with people, shaking hands, and making connections with as many people as they could, all they had energy for was a thrown-together private party for their daughter at the end of the day. While reading this, I could feel a tightness in my diaphragm . . . I had a feeling I knew what was coming . . . and then she described the look she and Barak Obama exchanged, a tired and rueful \u201cwe really blew it, didn\u2019t we\u201d look. At that moment Malia came over, plopped herself in her daddy\u2019s lap and said, \u201cThis is the best birthday ever\u201d! I lost it.There is so much in this memoir that is inspiring, interesting, fascinating even. I could write an entire short story on everything this book gifted me. Instead, if you haven\u2019t already, I urge you to read it. It is a remarkable story that is uplifting and, despite all odds, all the hurdles, and all that has followed since the Obama family left the White House, it remains hopeful, and it re-kindled hope in my own heart. ", "Becoming like Michelle Obama herself, is both eloquent and relatable. She talks about becoming her, becoming us, and finally, becoming more. As most of us know by now, Michelle is from Chicago, grew up with loving and supportive parents, attended Princeton followed by Harvard for law school, then began her position as an associate at the prestigious law firm of Sidley Austin, where she eventually met Barack. My favorite section of the book was by far, Becoming Us, in which Michelle describes meeting Barack and the evolvement of their relationship. Michelle does not pretend living in the White House was not a privilege or shy away from the associated perks. She doesn\u2019t pretend it was always amazing and wonderful either. There were plenty of tough days with the various events happening around the world. The pressure and scrutiny of trying to raise 2 daughters with some semblance of normalcy could also be taxing on the family of 4. Through it all, Michelle always remained committed to being the best mom to Sasha and Malia. The nostalgia and longing for the former Obama reign in the White House, was, as I read this memoir, and is, still real. The Obamas are admirable not just for their smart talents but also their continued relatability. They are genuine people who want more for their kids, for their country, and just doing their part to contribute to this goal. A tad oversimplified? Maybe, but if it\u2019s not clear yet, I\u2019m a huge fan. \u201dFor me, becoming isn\u2019t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it more as a forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to continuously reach toward a better self. The journey doesn\u2019t end. I became a mother, but I still have a lot to learn from and give to my children. I became a wife, but I continue to adapt to and be humbled by what it means to truly love and make a life with another person. I have become, by certain measures, a person of power, and yet there are still moments when I feel insecure or unheard. It\u2019s all a process, steps along a path. Becoming requires patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there\u2019s more growing up to be done.\u201cHighly recommend Becoming for fans Michelle, Barack, and the Obama administration.", "i\u2019ve been crying for like 3 hours lol", "Michelle Obama calling Donald Trump a bully in one of the best selling books of the year gave me the strength to get through 2019. This was wonderful to listen to, Michelle is beautifully eloquent and her way with words was bewitching. I listened to this in the car and at times found myself just sitting in the car outside work/home/wherever just so i could finish listening the chapter. This book is relatable in all the best ways, incredibly interesting and most importantly, inspiring. I'm fairly confident this will be one of my favourite reads of the year.I loved this and i really think you will too.", "\nRating: 4.5 stars\n", "I found this fast-paced, interesting, and touching. Also, heartbreaking to be painfully reminded of having once had a thoughtful, ethical president and first lady, and the vindictive, misogynist, racist disaster who doesn\u2019t read that we have now. Michelle wrote about how guilty she felt for putting out secret service agents and people driving in New York City so she and Barack could have a rare date night together. Now we have a president who doesn\u2019t mind squandering 3.6 million taxpayer dollars every time he wants to play golf at his own resort. (Currently at a total of more than 72 million\u2014how many teachers could we pay, schools and bridges could we repair if he cared at all?)I also felt more close to the Obama\u2019s because even though I\u2019m white and not Ivy League material, it was interesting to read about their astronomical student loan debt and that though both of them could have made a ton of money in corporate law, Barack wanted to do something to help people and Michelle got out of corporate law for the same reason, well before Barack had his sights on national politics. I also struggled with student loans and car payments. When I paid them off I thought, now life will be a lot easier. Ha! Whoops. Turns out life is always ready to just present new challenges. It seems strange to me that Michelle\u2019s initiative to get folks, kids in particular, to eat more vegetables and be more active could in any way be construed as controversial when Diabetes 2 is ravaging our nation. Michelle herself learned a lot about nutrition upon becoming first lady. She'd always worked out, but often took her girls to McDonalds to save time pre-White House.I enjoyed this memoir a lot. I teared up at times, remembering the sad events that Michelle and Barack were on the front lines for like Sandy Hook and the deaths of black folks and gay folks at the hands of cops and racists and homophobes. For all the attacks made on her for stupid things like what she wore, Michelle has been able to remain largely upbeat and positive, and this book reflects that. It\u2019s an important contribution to history. Her story of how education helped her get from where she was economically on the South Side of Chicago, which grew less racially diverse every year because of white flight, is truly inspiring, as is the way she is as a mother, wife, career woman, and human being. For more reviews, please visit http://www.theresaalan.net/blog", "MonumentalMichelle Obama\u2019s book, Becoming, is a refreshingly honest and fascinating insight into the major decisions, challenges and events in her life. This left me with even more respect and admiration for her and Barak. It provides wonderful coverage of her thinking and actions through life, from childhood to lawyer, to wife and mother, and to First Lady.Michelle\u2019s background in the South Shore neighbourhood in Chicago is openly chronicled to the reader and shows a person shaped by her hardworking and loving family, a father that grafted every single day at the water filtration plant, even with multiple sclerosis making it difficult to walk. The foundations of her determination and her devotion to her own family with Barak were rooted deeply during those early years. Her telling of losing family and friends is just heartbreaking, more because she goes beyond loss, and ties it to the gift of life, and life\u2019s lessons.After meeting Barak and establishing a loving relationship, Michelle recognised his vision and drive, which led her to question her own highly paid legal career. She would seek something that would give her similar meaning and purpose, that would go well beyond the need to secure a higher and higher salary. She changed jobs, taking massive pay cuts to find that meaning, purpose and contribution to society. She worked for non-profits, City Hall, healthcare and academia, so she could make an impact where it mattered, to heal divisions and disparities.What has inspired me most about Michelle and Barak is that they give a sense of possibility to ordinary people. A possibility that doesn\u2019t require sacrificing everything for that single self-centred goal. We can strive for a life of balance, a balance between family and career, between self-need and freely giving, and between reality and dreams. The realm of politics is very strange and I have often held a thought that anyone determined to be in politics should be enough reason for them not to be elected. Those thoughts played on Michelle\u2019s mind as she watched Barak become drawn into that manipulative and dishonest world. While ultimately providing all the support she could to her husband's mission, she was steadfast in keeping her focus on family needs. There are slips along the way but with careful and honest reflection, she grounds the family again and prevents the glamour of their position affecting her family values. \n\u201cI was a full-time mother and wife now, albeit a wife with a cause and a mother who wanted to guard her kids against getting swallowed by that cause.\u201d\nThis book provides a unique perspective on the greatest political achievement for many decades in the US. The achievement that working class people can further their education, their careers and their dreams to the pinnacle of ambition. What caught the imagination of the world was that Barak Obama would not only become the USA\u2019s first black president but would disregard the supposition that only money families could achieve such a high office.Of course, this book is inspirational, but it is also the manner in which it was achieved that inspired people worldwide. Michelle pays such heartfelt devotion and praise to her husband\u2019s role and gives another lens on his achievements. Barak\u2019s views came from a place of inclusion, positivity, caring, principles and hard work. Compare that with what we see today, not only in the US but globally. He also had a natural ability to engage people and inspire possibilities. \n\u201cBarack looked out at the audience and into the TV cameras, and as if kick-starting some internal engine, he just smiled and began to roll. He spoke for seventeen minutes that night, explaining who he was and where he came from.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe media response to Barack\u2019s speech was hyperbolic. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen the first black president,\u201d Chris Matthews declared to his fellow commentators on NBC.\u201d\nMichelle\u2019s life as First Lady illustrates how serious she took the role and how she used it to tackle issues that were important to her, such as the families of service personnel, and the education rights for girls, while also remaining resolute in maintaining a regular family life that they would return to when the presidency terms were over. She is a lady of utmost intelligence and dignity, with a strong moral focus. Pity, she won\u2019t ever run for President - we'll see.I felt the book revealed more than I was expecting, however, it wasn\u2019t a tell-all account and provided the perfect balance between factual insight and titillating gossip. The book created a captivating and enthralling story, deeply moving at times, and with a conviction to keep family and friends\u2019 secrets private.I listened to the audiobook version so I could take the opportunity of hearing Michelle Obama\u2019s story in her own eloquent words. The narration feels deeply moving and personal and on the many emotional events in her life, it becomes so touching that you are totally enchanted in the little bubble that now surrounds you.This is a book I highly recommend it and really worth reading or my preference, listening to."], "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Biography", "Audiobook"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/60334006-becoming", "avg_ratings": "4.56", "ShelvedNumber": "7162"}

{"published_year": "2018", "rating_counts": "594004", "ISBN": "0399590501\n", "description": "Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her \"head-for-the-hills bag\". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg", "title": "Educated", "authors": "Tara Westover", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated", "reviews": ["\nOn the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.\nEducated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times\nWe had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene\u2019s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.\n\u2026he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father\u2019s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one\u2019s ills, calling her products \u201cgod\u2019s pharmacy.\u201d And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover\u2019s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom\u2019s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.\n\u2026there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother\u2019s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun\u2019s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara\u2019s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family\u2019s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?\nAll abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you\u2019re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as \u201cShawn\u201d in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara\u2019s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, \u201cYer a wizard, Harry.\u201dWhen setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she\u2019d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss. Review Posted \u2013 3/23/18Published \u2013 2/20/18November 29, 2018 - Educated is named as one of The 10 Best Books of 2018December 2019 - Educated is named winner of the 2018 Goodreads Choice Award for memoirs, beating out Michelle Obamas's blockbuster hit, Becoming. From a GR interview with Westover\nGoodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I\u2019m really, really excited about it. It\u2019s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, \"Oh, you wrote a good book,\" but it does mean something extra when it\u2019s readers, when it\u2019s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it\u2019s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers\u2019 award is a really exciting one. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAlthough the internet yielded no vids of Tara singing lead in her town\u2019s production of Annie in the wayback, here is one of grown-up Tara singing lead vocal on The Hills of Aran with John MeedInterviews----- C-Span - interviewed by Susannah Cahalan \u2013 video \u2013 1 hour \u2013 If you can manage only one of these, this is the one to see -----CBS This Morning - video \u2013 6:41-----Penguin promotional video \u2013 7:01-----Channel 4 News - 8:46-----NPR - with Dave Davies \u2013 the link includes text of the interview.

Whenever I don\u2019t know a lot about something, I\u2019ll read a textbook or watch an online course until I do.I thought I was pretty good at teaching myself\u2014until I read Tara Westover\u2019s memoir Educated. Her ability to learn on her own blows mine right out of the water. I was thrilled to sit down with her recently to talk about the book.Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in rural Idaho. Her dad had very non-mainstream views about the government. He believed doomsday was coming, and that the family should interact with the health and education systems as little as possible. As a result, she didn\u2019t step foot in a classroom until she was 17, and major medical crises went untreated (her mother suffered a brain injury in a car accident and never fully recovered).Because Tara and her six siblings worked at their father\u2019s junkyard from a young age, none of them received any kind of proper homeschooling. She had to teach herself algebra and trigonometry and self-studied for the ACT, which she did well enough on to gain admission to Brigham Young University. Eventually, she earned her doctorate in intellectual history from Cambridge University. (Full disclosure: she was a Gates Scholar, which I didn\u2019t even know until I reached that part of the book.)Educated is an amazing story, and I get why it\u2019s spent so much time on the top of the New York Times bestseller list. It reminded me in some ways of the Netflix documentary \nWild, Wild Country\n, which I recently watched. Both explore people who remove themselves from society because they have these beliefs and knowledge that they think make them more enlightened. Their belief systems benefit from their separateness, and you\u2019re forced to be either in or out.But unlike Wild, Wild Country\u2014which revels in the strangeness of its subjects\u2014Educated doesn\u2019t feel voyeuristic. Tara is never cruel, even when she\u2019s writing about some of her father\u2019s most fringe beliefs. It\u2019s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.Of the seven Westover siblings, three of them\u2014including Tara\u2014left home, and all three have earned Ph.D.s. Three doctorates in one family would be remarkable even for a more \u201cconventional\u201d household. I think there must\u2019ve been something about their childhood that gave them a degree of toughness and helped them persevere. Her dad taught the kids that they could teach themselves anything, and Tara\u2019s success is a testament to that.I found it fascinating how it took studying philosophy and history in school for Tara to trust her own perception of the world. Because she never went to school, her worldview was entirely shaped by her dad. He believed in conspiracy theories, and so she did, too. It wasn\u2019t until she went to BYU that she realized there were other perspectives on things her dad had presented as fact. For example, she had never heard of the Holocaust until her art history professor mentioned it. She had to research the subject to form her own opinion that was separate from her dad\u2019s.Her experience is an extreme version of something everyone goes through with their parents. At some point in your childhood, you go from thinking they know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. I\u2019m sad that Tara is estranged from a lot of her family because of this process, but the path she\u2019s taken and the life she\u2019s built for herself are truly inspiring.When you meet her, you don\u2019t have any impression of all the turmoil she\u2019s gone through. She\u2019s so articulate about the traumas of her childhood, including the physical abuse she suffered at the hands of one brother. I was impressed by how she talks so candidly about how na\u00efve she once was\u2014most of us find it difficult to talk about our own ignorance.I was especially interested to hear her take on polarization in America. Although it\u2019s not a political book, Educated touches on a number of the divides in our country: red states versus blue states, rural versus urban, college-educated versus not. Since she\u2019s spent her whole life moving between these worlds, I asked Tara what she thought. She told me she was disappointed in what she called the \u201cbreaking of charity\u201d\u2014an idea that comes from the Salem witch trials and refers to the moment when two members of the same group break apart and become different tribes.\u201cI worry that education is becoming a stick that some people use to beat other people into submission or becoming something that people feel arrogant about,\u201d she said. \u201cI think education is really just a process of self-discovery\u2014of developing a sense of self and what you think. I think of [it] as this great mechanism of connecting and equalizing.\u201dTara\u2019s process of self-discovery is beautifully captured in Educated. It\u2019s the kind of book that I think everyone will enjoy, no matter what genre you usually pick up. She\u2019s a talented writer, and I suspect this book isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll hear from her. I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next.", "Difficult to read. Impossible to put down. A powerful, powerful book that you shouldn\u2019t miss. I can\u2019t just leave it at that because Tara Westover\u2019s story deserves more than those few words. I don\u2019t often read memoirs, but when I do I want them to be told by extraordinary people who have a meaningful story to tell and that would be faint praise for this book. It sounds odd to say how beautifully written this is because we are not spared of the ugly details of what this family was about, but yet it is beautifully written. I had to remind myself at times that I wasn\u2019t reading a gritty novel, that Tara and her family were real as I got more than just a glimpse of a life that was hard for me to even imagine. A religious fanatic father, hoarding food and guns and bullets and keeping his family off the radar, not filing for birth certificates, not getting medical attention when they needed it, avoiding the government, the feds at all cost , keeping his children out of school, the paranoia, the preparation for the \u201cDays of Abomination\u201d - this is what we find in this place on a mountain in Idaho. There are horrible accidents and he won\u2019t get medical help for his family. Her mother\u2019s healing herbs and tinctures are used to treat the slightest scrape to the most horrible head injury or burns from gasoline to an explosion. If some thing bad happens it because that\u2019s the will of the Lord. Her mother seems at times more sympathetic to her children, but she is complicit by her subservience to her husband. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it other than gut wrenching to see the effects on this family of neglect in the name of religious beliefs and in reality mental illness. It isn\u2019t just her father but the brutality by one of her brother\u2019s which is more than awful and creates rifts between family members,  That she was bold enough and somehow found the will to rise above it all while she is torn with the sense of duty, of loyalty to her family, the ingrained beliefs, still loving her family is miraculous. Going to college was the first time she\u2019d been in a classroom, not knowing what the Holocaust was, learning about slavery, the depression, WWII, the civil rights movement. She doesn\u2019t just get a college education but ultimately a PhD from Cambridge, a Harvard fellowship. She struggles for years to discover who she was, who she could be - a scholar, a writer, an independent woman. This is a stunning, awe inspiring story that will haunt the reader long after the book ends. Thank you to Tara Westover for sharing yourself with us. I received an advanced copy of this book from Random House through NetGalley. Thanks to my friend Diane for bringing this book to my attention. Without her review I might have missed this.", "What an interesting fantasy novel.I'm kidding. I think. Some parts of this do seem farfetched, such as how an uneducated mountain wildgirl clicked her heels together, magicked up thousands of dollars (yeah, yeah, scholarships don't cover everything, you know), and went on to some of the world's most prestigious higher education centres. Intelligence is not the main thing required to attend Harvard or Cambridge; being able to pass exams and perform the system's dance is. Someone without formal education should have no idea how to do that.Also-- are some people magically cured by herbs and finger-clicking here or did I miss some medical intervention along the way?But I think, overall, I was just a little underwhelmed by this book because everyone seemed to find the survivalist aspect so dramatic and awful. I've read a few books about isolated communities that go off the grid and enforce their own laws and, I have to say, Westover's experience felt pretty tame. Her family were survivalists who spent months canning peaches and hunting for scrap, but is this really that odd? My grandfather used to take us to collect blackberries and then we'd spend time making blackberry jam and canning. How avant-garde.They are also just really bad at going off the grid. I heard all these promises of \"wilderness\" and \"mountain survivalists\" but they have a phone and TV. Come on, guys! If you're going to do it, do it properly. I would say this family is more \"eccentric\" than \"survivalist\".Where the book does succeed is as a portrait of physical and emotional abuse. I think this was the most important part of the book and it's been glossed over in favour of people's delight at learning about weirdos running around wild in the mountains. (I'm not judging; I came for that too.) I also found it really interesting and sad when the author suggested that her father's paranoid delusions might have been undiagnosed bipolar disorder. It's a quick read with crowd-pleasing writing, I'll give it that. But it's hard to not feel like something is amiss, and certain events were probably exaggerated. Or, alternatively, Westover's \"survivalist\" family were sitting on a few on-the-grid dollars that conveniently popped up when equipment needed repairs and people needed to go to college. It's also possible that the writing lacked clarity because some things definitely didn't add up.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "\"It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you\"I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .Tara grows up free or wild. She didn\u2019t bathe that often, didn\u2019t wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc. I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid forPlus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College isn't cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she didn't seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to \"learn\". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who doesn't want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I don't care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book. What worked for me in this book was Tara's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just wasn't for me.I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing group and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com", "2 stars and I know, I am an outlier.I have been born with a gene called the \"doubting Thomas\" gene. It has made me very leery of trusting and believing a lot of things and unfortunately this gene kicked in big time in this story billed as a memoir.While I do believe that the things described by Tara Westover might have happened, I also have to think that this was a book of childhood memories. Sometimes, as children, we distort the truth, and sometimes grown to adulthood we only remember fragments of what happened and when confronted by others realize our memory was somewhat faulty.There are actually quite a few things I just could not wrap my hands around in this story. For one, being a former teacher and having had the pleasure of teaching many gifted and brilliant students, I just could not see what, with the quantum lapses in Tara's education, how she could possibly have made it into both a fairly prestigious college and then onto the highest level of university in England. Learning builds upon itself and being a former math teacher, I can say that if one only had the rudimentary knowledge of the four simple math functions, that going onto higher level math would be virtually impossible. Was it possible that her early education being home schooled was not as lacking as she described it to be?The next issue I had was that of the number of injuries incurred by she and her brothers and her mother just snapping her fingers, using essential oils and other agents and then recovery occurred. Granted, I am not a medical professional, but the incidents described in one or two particular cases was life threatening and yet these techniques done by the mother worked? I know I still blame it on my doubting Thomas gene. I do also have a belief in both holistic and regular medicine being a partnership in the healing process.Next up for me, was Tara's ability to obtain somehow the finances to attend college and then to travel overseas to England and back. Yes, I do know that she was awarded scholarships but what about the incidentals, travel, food not provided in school. Did she live like a hermit and never leave the confines of the school she was attending? From her writing, we know that is not true.Lastly, if indeed these things were happening, where were the people who should have noticed the abuse? Where were the friends, the church goers, the people who did business with the father? Would they have not noticed untoward things happening to the Westover children. Would not at least one of them have come forward? Why are some of them coming forward now to defend this family?So, sorry to say, I am going against the grain of many of my fellow much respected readers and reviewers, and saying that I just could not buy into what was being set forward in this book. I am not an advocate for her parents, nor do I think that things never did happen. Perhaps to me, this book just has not explained the circumstances well enough for the doubting Thomas in me to believe. Thankful to my Traveling Sisters who read this book along with me. We all seemed to share the same ideas on this one and I am glad as always to have my thoughts and feeling able to be expressed to such a wonderful group of avid readers. Also thank you to netgalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book.", "I had a really tough time reading this book.The physical and emotional abuse made me want to put it down and forget about it. The manipulation, the abuse she went through left me speechless. While not unique, family issues are still so taboo. Brainwashing your own self into thinking it's your fault, that it wasn't that bad or that you imagined it will hit way too close for comfort for a lot of people.The author's writing was beautiful and her courage to get an education and stand up to her family was inspiring.Do recommend if you can stomach it.", "5 brilliant stars to Educated! \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f I grew up in a home of readers with a teacher mom and a dad who questioned my effort when I made an A-minus on my report card. When I began reading Educated, I was floored that Tara and her siblings were not in school, and they were not homeschooled either. How could this happen in modern times with compulsory schooling put in place long ago? Tara made it clear from the start that her family\u2019s Mormon faith did not cause her father\u2019s substantial paranoia; however, he used his faith to feed it. This family not only did not have insurance, they did not believe in accessing traditional medical care. Horrific accidents and illnesses abounded due to the father\u2019s and one sibling\u2019s risk-taking, and no one went to the doctor. While the family was clearly having difficulty grappling with many things, I was struck by the love and devotion between them, even with the strained family dynamics. It was both fascinating and heartbreaking to watch those dynamics shift even more as Tara\u2019s aspirations developed and were achieved. Strength. Grit. Perseverance. Tara\u2019s tenacity resulted in her leaving the farm at Buck\u2019s Peak and enrolling in college, after never attending a day of school. Her words were upfront, bold, but never complaining or looking for pity. Overall, I found Educated to be one of the most engaging, powerful, and inspiring memoirs I have read. Thank you to Tara Westover, Random House, and Netgalley for this reading experience I will treasure. Educated is now available!", "Every second of this book is enthralling!EVERY.SINGLE.SECOND.The tales in here are true. The stories are mind-blowing. The events are not from a time long ago - they happened in the past 20 years! You will have to keep reminding yourself of that because the mindset and ideas discussed sound antiquated, but they are alive and kicking . . . and that is just crazy!One thing that brought this story close to home is that at the time a lot of the events in this book we're taking place, I was living in Yellowstone National Park and frequently travelled to or through Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Salt Lake City and all points in between. This means I could have been mere miles away from the events in this book while they were taking place! Again, this seems impossible to me and I had to keep reminding myself that this was happening in my neck of the woods! And, because of this, my mind was repeatedly blown.I suppose I should mention what might be a trigger warning for some. Most of the men and some of the women in this book are described doing crazy and abusive things. I swear that every few minutes I had to stop, collect my thoughts, and say, \"Wow!\" While none of us were there to witness this and the author even says there are many who will deny the events and say that her version of the events are driven by the devil himself, they are shocking and will get your mind churning! I feel her frustration and so many times I wanted to reach into the pages and tell her, \"It doesn't have to be like this!\"Also, another trigger warning, if you work for OSHA or help maintain OSHA workplace safety standards, you are going to probably throw this book across the room or at least slam it in disgust a few times.This book is amazing and I highly recommend it - I am driven to follow this up by hunting down interviews with the author.", "Tara Westover\u2019s book \u201cEducated\u201d is a distressing & discomforting - alarming & startling exposure of her Mormon fundamentalist family. \u201cEducated\u201d is a memoir of nonfiction - but names and identifying details have been changed. Aaron, Audrey, Benjamin, Erin, Faye, Gene, Vanessa, Judy, Peter, Sadie, Shannon, Shawn, Susan, Robert, and Robin are pseudonyms. Tara tells us in her authors notes: \u201cThis is not about Mormonism. Neither is it about any other form of religious belief. In it there are many types of people, some believers, some not; some kind, some not. The author disputes any correlation, positive or negative, between the two\u201d. Yet....as I read this novel - I not only felt angry - sickened at times - but really conflicted too. I had duel thoughts from the beginning of this novel to the end. I \u2018did\u2019 think - in part this book was about Mormonism ( let\u2019s call a spade a spade). Tara and her siblings had backpacks filled with supplies to defend themselves ready to \u201chead-for-the-hills\u201d ....ready to run ( away from the government).Her dad, Gene, feared that the government might one day try to intervene their lifestyle. They were living off the grid. The kids had no formal education, or medical care when sick or injured. Instead of going to the hospital when needed - their mother, midwife/herbalist cared for them with alternative remedies. The government might have even brought in social workers to evaluate the health their family. Abuse? YES! This family stayed hidden. Abuse in many forms was hidden. Tara\u2019s memoir-impart- also details ( summarizes) the transitions and challenges entering the academic world -Brigham Young University- Harvard- Cambridge ( PhD in History). Her educational journey was interesting \u2014 some of it maddening to me also ....not faulting anyone - but it was painful for me to discover just how \u2018much\u2019 about the world - life changing world events a 7 year old knew - at age 17 she \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019 know - yet somehow was studying at a University. I questioned \u2018how was this even possible\u2019? Amazing. Tara had great support from a church entering college...which was wonderful. At times I felt frustrated \u2018besides\u2019 some greatly disturbing horrific frightening descriptions during Tara\u2019s childhood. Tara\u2019s academic accomplishments were extraordinary\u2014but I couldn\u2019t find her voice. She seemed - fragile - and often so uncertain of herself. This book is very well written - ( gloomy -perplexing - and wearisome at times from repetitive trips back home to seek validation from her family)- but it seemed her education brought her almost as much pain as it did inner fulfillment. Because Tara disputes any difference between negative and positive \u2014admirable in ways \u2014I had a hard time getting an experience of \u2018HER\u2019. I admit it\u2019s my own frustration. This young girl had a childhood I could never fully comprehend- or know what scars remain...but the fact stands \u2014 she's living proof that amazing change is possible. Tara calls that \u201can education\u201d. Alright ....I agree....but I\u2019m still sad and feel incomplete. ( it\u2019s my problem - not hers). There have been comparisons to this book and \u201cThe Glass Castle\u201d. I understand that \u2014 but in reality they are presented very differently. Not only does Jeannette Walls not change any names in her book \u2014 she had just freedom to go on National television with her homeless mother. She didn\u2019t need to hide or change identifying details. Tara Westover felt the need to keep names hidden. ( less freedom between the author and her readers for full- self expression). I understand- but a little less satisfying. I DO FEEL THIS BOOK OUGHT TO BE READ ....I DO SEE THIS BOOK\u2019S IMPORTANCE....a story about an American family living by their own rules - ignoring others who don\u2019t follow their beliefs. WE SEE TARA WESTOVER\u2019S SKILLFUL LYRICISM in this book....very impressive\u2014 one of the most inspiring aspects to me. With her achievements, education, and talent, we got a well-written fascinating SAD STORY.I will think about Tara - worry & wonder about her in years to come. It killed me that Tara continued time and time again to seek validation - I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s over. She kept going home to a place where her own brother tried to kill her \u2014She almost begged her mother to see her time and time again too\u2014 it was soooo painful to me that her mother rejected her \u2014\u2014but just as painful that Tara kept needing their approval. All so sad. I UNDERSTAND....yet I can\u2019t see who she is through her own behavior. Tara has an inspiring academic education\u2014 a relationship with 3 of her siblings but trying to regain a relationship with her parents - her violent brother - and even one of her sisters she was once very close to was like trying to get blood from a turnip....it just wasn\u2019t possible. It made for very frustrating reading. Why did Tara keep trying to fill her heart with the family that rejected her several times? And were abusive? And can a book education take that pain away? These are questions that lingered with me. Tara had a sweet - warm- soft voice on NPR. Her interviewer called her dad a \u2018character\u2019. She agreed. All light and fluffy. Tara share About MANY HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES on NPR. I was a little confused listening to her. Was she happy or angry? She seemed so happy about her childhood. Huh? Yet for years she suffered abuse which she tells us in her book. On NPR:She said the junkyard was playful and exotic, but was dangerous....but also fun.She said the Mountain where she grew up was magical and beautiful.....but they were closed off from the rest of the world. Duality....duality...duality ...... is a word that Tara used over and over again on NPR. Tara see\u2019s two sides to her entire life. I felt a little \u201cduality\u201d in this story myself. I still feel Tara herself is hidden from this story. Can\u2019t put my finger on it. But one thing does hit home \u2014 we can\u2019t meet the rest of her family like we were able to of Jeannette Walls. So - this is clearly TARA\u2019S memoir....and I\u2019ll respect it at that. This is a valuable powerful read but I\u2019m guessing there might be more to this story one day. Thank You Netgalley, Random House, and Tara Westover ( congrats to you on your book - may you continue to find inner peace and happiness) 4.4 Stars", "\"Not knowing for certain, but refusing to give way to those who claim certainty, was a privilege I had never allowed myself. My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.\"- Tara Westover, Educated: A MemoirThis book feels like it was written by a sister, a cousin, a niece. Tara Westover grew up a few mountains over from my dad's Heglar ranch. I don't know her. Don't know her family. She grew up about 70-80+ miles South East as the crow flies, but realistically, it was a 1.5 hours drive difference, and a whole planet of Mormonism over. I didn't grow up in Idaho. I was born there and returned there yearly. But this book is filled with the geography, culture, behaviors, mountains, religion, schools, and extremes I understand. She is writing from a similar, and often shared space. I didn't just read this book, I felt it on every page. Her prose was amazing. The memoir danced at parts, while a couple pages later, I would be sent up for air. I often found myself having to talk through parts of the book with my wife while reading. It flowed. Some books seem to remove friction while you read. My wife abandoned work for a day to read it. It consumed us.This book reads like a modern-day, Horatio Alger + The Education of Henry Adams: An Autobiography. However, it isn't just a book about how a girl with little formal education from a small town in Idaho makes it to Cambridge. It is also a tale of escape, and a historiography. Westover is using her own life to do a popular memory study on herself. She is looking at how she viewed her religion, her background, her parents, and her education. She explores how those memories and narratives change and reorient based upon proximity to her family, her father. These narratives especially begin to reorient as she becomes \"educated.\"I bought a copy and before I even read it, I gave it to my father to read (He grew up in Heglar, ID). Then I bought another couple and yesterday and today my wife and I raced to finish our respective copies. We bored our kids talking about it over two dinners. We both finished it within minutes of each other tonight. Tara Westover's memoir hit me hard because of the struggle she has owning her own narrative. Through many vectors I related to her (we both graduated from BYU with Honors, were both were from Idaho, educated Mormons, and both have preppers in the family). My family, while sharing similar land, a similar start, and a similar undergraduate education, however, are not Tara's. And that is what made this memoir so compelling. It was like reading a Dickens novel, but one that was set in your neighborhood. It was moving, sad, and tremendous. In the end, I was attracted by how close the story felt, but I was also VERY grateful her story wasn't THAT close.", "This one first came to my attention via a GR review. I thought wow, I need to read this now. The wonderful Traveling Sisters group set it up as a slow read and I was in. Grabbed a copy from NetGalley and was ready to go. BUT.....and a big BUT......I didn't like this one, I had to force myself to finish. Had it not been for the group read, I'm sure I would have DNF'd this one.So I'm probably in the minority in not liking this one. It was more of a 'having a hard time believing the story' kinda thing. Tara details her life growing up in the mountains. She paints a picture of this wild child who doesn't bathe, or wash her hands after using the toilet (her grandmother had a fit about this), is quite ignorant, but yet...she self teaches herself to get into a prestigious college. She talks about her childhood and her parents seems so bad - no schooling, must work and earn money, her father seems to be a religious zealot who harbors a fear of the govt, her mother creates tinctures that cure people from near death. It just became a bit much and I was having a hard time believing it all. Multiple car accidents, severe burns, head trauma, and all cured with herbs. But then she wants to go to school, so she does...college, gets a PhD. Where did she get the money? They didn't seem to have much money. Yet, being in the 'mountain' rustic home, they had a phone, tv, internet. I dunno, it was just getting to be a bit much for me to believe. She ended up having multiple siblings teach themselves, go to college, and get advanced degrees. Really?A memoir is defined as an autobiography or a written account of one's memory of certain events. Maybe this is how she remembers everything, maybe it really all happened this way. I really don't know. But it all just did not add up for me. I had so many questions about everything. I have a family member who remembers his childhood different from how I remember HIS childhood. So it happens. I'll just say thanks to NetGalley for an advanced copy of the read and this in no way influenced my review.", "I grew up with my nose perpetually in a book. So, the idea of not being able to go to school, of being deprived of an education, hit me really hard. It was hard for me to grasp that things I take for granted, like knowing what the Holocaust was or who MLK, Jr. was, were black holes to Tara. Tara Westover is the child of a religious fanatic, someone who sees the government as pure evil. And by government, he means schools, hospitals, vaccines, seat belts, car insurance, etc. Everything we think of as civilization. His family awaits the Days of Abomination. There is a similarity here to The Glass Castle. Once again, we see how a mentally unbalanced father holds sway over an entire family. He thinks he speaks for God. Tara struggles with the knowledge that for her to go to school will mean a total separation from her father because he will never acknowledge that his ideas are not the correct ones. Parts of this book are cringeworthy. I found myself shaking my head that folks would allow severe suffering rather than a trip to the hospital or the use of real medicine. I\u2019ll warn you that some of these sections are not for the faint of heart. The descriptions are sickening. I know little to nothing about the Mormon faith. Certainly, the faith of this family is not the true Mormon faith. But you get glimpses enough to also realize that there is a strong anti-woman bias in the faith and that women are definitely second class citizens. Broodmares more than humans on a par with men. This book doesn\u2019t sugarcoat things. It\u2019s not an education makes everything better kind of story. Tara continues throughout the book to struggle to find her way, to stand up for her beliefs. Hell, to find her own beliefs. This is an amazing book. It makes you realize how easy your life is. And how strong folks like Tara are to be able to rise above their beginnings and be able to fight back against the attempts of family to hold them down. I\u2019m willing to bet this book makes it onto a lot of best of 2018 lists. It will certainly be on mine. Highly recommend! My thanks to netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book. ", "A monumental memoir that should be required reading for all. The description doesn't do it justice. It's not about getting a PhD, it's about growing up in a family that doesn't believe in school, thinks doctors are a part of a sociologist conspiracy, and that any day the government will shoot them dead--if the end of times don't come first. The experiences Tara describes are horrific, yet oddly relatable--even if your family is nothing like hers (and let's hope it isn't). By the end, she has to come to terms with balancing family bonds and having the strength to see past their warped sense of reality.There's really no words to describe it, but I'd start with moving, inspiring, shocking and un-put-downable. Stop wasting your time reading this review and start reading the book! IT'S SO GOOD!!!", "So good. So good. SO GOOD. Ok, I'll try to elaborate. Tara Westover's memoir is incredibly engrossing not just because of the rollercoaster of traumatic events that occur throughout her life, but also because of her ability to weave humanity and complicated familial relationships in her portrayal of events. While it's easy to take these events and market it like a thriller novel, it's that sense of reflection and poignancy in her carefully crafted words that is the book\u2019s strongest asset. As awful as her family is, she tries to make them as multifaceted as possible by describing both the horrific treatment she dealt with alongside the tender moments that have made it hard for her to let go. I have always been either apathetic or critical about our education system, but I loved Westover\u2019s insights that her education has afforded her to expand her worldview and transform her into her own individual. I would recommend this book to anyone who comes from a dysfunctional family as proof that you don\u2019t have to be trapped in your circumstances and can seek a better life for yourself.A common critique is questioning how much of her memoir is embellished. My gut reaction is to take offense, as these dismissals have implications of not believing a victim of abuse and gaslighting her like her family did. But I know that all memoirs have degrees of embellishments, and it\u2019s fair to have healthy skepticism. However, she peppers several footnotes throughout her memoir that point out contradictions in her memory based on different accounts of her siblings. This indicates that she is aware of how memories can be subjective, and the fact that she even clarified where her own perspectives differed and included different accounts showed that her priority was telling her story as truthfully as she can. That\u2019s all you can really ask of someone bearing their life story. I believe the book and trauma she went through are completely valid, and her efforts in both staying true to her experiences while sharing different accounts reassure me in that validity.", "\nEverything about this book amazed me. I will not stop thinking about this book for a very, very long time. I don't think I can even do this proper justice in a review other than telling everyone to go out and READ THIS BOOK! Easiest 5 stars ever. Loved it.\n", "To be honest, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m bothering to review this.There is no scenario in which I am a more trusted source than Obama, Oprah, the New York Times Book Review, and the Goodreads Choice Awards combined, and if they\u2019ve all already told you to read this (which they have) then I don\u2019t know why my recommendation would push this whole thing over the edge for you.If I am a more trusted source than all of those, then I just don\u2019t know what to tell you. Besides the fact that I\u2019m concerned for us both. But here we are, so. Introducing: My thoughts. My thoughts are: that this is a very good book.Truly groundbreaking stuff, I know.But really - it\u2019s worth the hype. And this is coming from the girl who\u2019s one-starred so many popular books she has an \u201cunpopular opinions\u201d shelf with hundreds of books on it.Can the New York Times Book Review say that?Maybe I should be the more trusted source.Anyway. This is not only beautifully written (and it is beautifully written), it\u2019s stunningly recollected too. The emotional intelligence of the author is so vivid in every page. There is so much empathy here.This is already an incredible, gorgeous story, with a profound and impactful arc, but the talent of the author is what really makes it masterful.Bottom line: This is good sh*t.(You don\u2019t get that kind of blurb from Oprah.)----------oprah was right.review to come / 4.5 stars----------all it takes to convince me to read a book is 500,000 ratings with a 4.48 average + a Goodreads award + tons of nominations + the New York Times, Barack Obama, Oprah, and every major publication naming it one of the best of the year.", "5 OMG How did she end up alive and educated? stars[News flash: I see that this review is WAY too long! I\u2019m such a blabbermouth! Feel free to skip sections. I went way overboard. Geez\u2026.]Tara did a lot more than ride a pogo stick to get from a junkyard in Idaho to a Ph.D. in Cambridge.Meanwhile, I\u2019m bouncing on mine, going high and far to escape her whacked-out father and super-scary psycho brother. Plus, face it, I bring out the pogo stick when it\u2019s a fantastic read and believe me, this qualifies. Holy moly what a tough and bizarro life this amazing woman has had, and oh what a writer!She looks normal, whatever that means.I was so jazzed after reading this book, I went online and watched every interview with Tara that I could find (and there are many; I\u2019ve added a few at the end of this review). I just had to see and hear this woman, this woman who had a strange, horrendous, and dangerous childhood and lived to tell about it\u2014and so eloquently. She\u2019s only in her 20s\u2014so young to be so successful. From the interviews, I see that she happens to be articulate, quick-witted, and confident, and she totally passes for normal, whatever that is. On the outside, you don\u2019t see the scars, the scars that have to exist on her psyche after the hellacious childhood she endured.Spare me the scenery, I want the juice!I didn\u2019t love this book for the first half hour or so of reading; I thought I was in deep do-do. Again, it\u2019s that damn description\u2014which just isn\u2019t my style. The book opens with Tara describing the beauteous mountain that she grew up on. It was perfectly written; a creative writing teacher would have been damn proud of her. But I was screaming inside, \u201cThis is a memoir! Tell your story!! Give me some juice! Tell me what happened and how you feel. Save the mountain business for a poem, will you please?\u201d Ha, the mountain was affecting me too\u2014I didn\u2019t like it because it was this giant barricade blocking me from feeling anything about this writer or her story. Luckily, the mountain talk stopped and then I got pulled in real fast. And as I got into the story and forgave her for her brief stint with DD (description disorder, which some writers are afflicted with), I have to admit I sort of liked that she described the mountain and her love for it. The mountain gave her some feeling of safety and peace, and its beauty stayed with her as she trekked to places far away to get her education. Refraining from spilling all the beans.I could sit here and write a Cliffs Notes version of her life, just because I\u2019m so excited to share it, but I\u2019ll try to put a sock in it (one of the two that were knocked off my feet by the power of this story) because you really need to experience this book all for yourself.Dad buried gas and guns.Tara is the youngest of seven kids, all raised in the mountains of Idaho by a madman father who was a religious fanatic and believed the end of the world was coming. He buried gas and guns so that they could survive after the end came. He thought the government, schools, and medicine were all bull\u2014and dangerous. It was all about God\u2019s will and Satan\u2019s grip. He was charismatic and forceful. Although Tara doesn\u2019t think of it as a cult, it sure seemed like a family cult to me, with her dad as the far-out leader. He brainwashed all of them. She says she\u2019ll always have to stop and question whether what he said was true.They are Mormons, but the type of religion is beside the point. Dad is an extremist, that\u2019s all we need to know. Tara says right up front that the book is not about Mormons. I absolutely hate religious rantings, but luckily no one is pushing the religion; Tara is just telling us what it was like around her house. Tara doesn\u2019t talk about her religious beliefs today; I\u2019m mildly curious. At the time, she believed everything he said.The state didn\u2019t know Tara existed.Tara doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate and doesn\u2019t know her birthday--just an approximation. How weird would that be? She was born at home and her father didn\u2019t register her existence because he didn\u2019t want the government to make her go to school. When she is seven, she says: \u201c\u2026When I am nine, I will be issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth, but at this moment, according to the state of Idaho and the federal government, I do not exist.\u201dBurns and gashes and raccoon eyes.I will say that this memoir reads like fiction. It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s not. Expect to bite your lip and grimace and scream inside as you read detailed descriptions of MANY accidents that happened to Tara and her family members. Burns and gashes and raccoon eyes and brains hitting concrete. Some people say that she probably misremembered or exaggerated, but I say you don\u2019t make up seeing your brother\u2019s brain peeking out of his skull. How did they all stay alive?Psycho bro.And then there\u2019s the mental and physical torture that her psycho brother Shawn inflicted on Tara and others. Oh, he\u2019s a cutie all right. He broke her fingers, put her head in the toilet\u2014normal stuff like that. If there was ever a need for a therapist\u2026.Doesn\u2019t every kid risk their life working in a junkyard?Tara doesn\u2019t play the victim. And she doesn\u2019t hate her family\u2014which at first seems hard to believe. But she says her life seemed normal to her: she had nothing to compare it to, for one. All kids must help their fathers work; her dad just happened to own a junkyard with dangerous equipment. How could she know that other families didn\u2019t get injured all the time? How did she know that other families went to hospitals instead of using herbs to cure everything? (Her mom is an accomplished herbalist.) And she knew her parents loved her and meant well. Dad couldn\u2019t help it that he was crazy. He did the best he could. So despite growing up in this intense, isolated family with a mad father, an abusive brother, horrific accidents, and a fear of the apocalypse, she doesn\u2019t think she had a terrible childhood-- and she has many good memories. Wow.Isn\u2019t Europe a country?Her formal education began when she was 17 when, after studying on her own for the ACT exams, she got into Brigham Young University. Before this, she had never stepped foot in a classroom. She had never heard of the Holocaust or the civil rights movement. She thought Europe was a country. She didn\u2019t think to read her textbooks; she thought she was supposed to just look at the pictures. Despite this, she ended up at Cambridge. She says getting an education is not about making money, but about making a person. Hell-bent on getting educated.I identify with her being hell-bent on getting educated and knowing she had to do it herself. My parents wouldn\u2019t send me to college (they wanted me to be a flight attendant, but they did worry I was too short). I had an intense drive to go to college. I went to the library to find out which city had the most colleges and that was Boston, with 58 of them! When I was 18, I moved there, determined to get accepted into one that I could afford (I did.) But wait, I must stick to Tara\u2019s story. I just wanted to say that I identified with her drive and her success in getting through college. (Ha, I wasn\u2019t anywhere near as smart as her; I certainly didn\u2019t end up at Cambridge University!)Her education (for her, an awakening) included taking psych courses. She realized then that her dad was probably mentally ill, and this knowledge allowed her to forgive him. He couldn\u2019t help being scary, controlling, and fanatical. And he didn\u2019t purposely put her in harm\u2019s way in the junkyard; he just didn\u2019t have the ability to see danger. Psych classes also helped her become super self-aware. I loved the parts in the book where she analyzes herself. One thing she talked about was gaslighting\u2014the process of people denying your reality and making you feel crazy. For example, this happened when she tried to tell her parents what her psycho brother had done to her. Although her mom first believed her, she soon changed her tune and sided with Tara\u2019s father, denying that such bad things happened. Tara says she started doubting her sanity\u2014which has to be scary. She says she had a breakdown at one point. Not surprising.Run, Tara, run! The only frustrating thing about her book is watching her return, time and time again, to visit her family. Quick, Tara, jump on my back as we pogo-stick on out of there! NOW! Psycho, sadistic bro Shawn is just too damn scary! He cranked it up a notch every time she visited, and I was scared he would seriously mess her up\u2014break a bigger bone, give her brain damage, throw her off the mountain, something really bad. Part of her need to return was to win her family\u2019s approval (and Shawn just happened to live there too, so there was no escaping him). But she also wanted to expose Shawn and to warn them about him, since he was attacking other people too. Plus, people who live together a long time get imprinted on each other. We can\u2019t underrate how much the existence of a history ties people together. I think the only way she would have severed ties would be if there had been sexual abuse. The skeptics.Some critics doubt whether her story is true, or they think it\u2019s exaggerated. She admits that we can\u2019t always believe our memories, that they are tricky. To try to make her story as accurate as possible, she looked back through her journals. Usually journals are full of fact, not fiction, so I believe it\u2019s a good source for her truth. Also, a couple of her brothers have corroborated her memories. I don\u2019t think she made this stuff up. I\u2019m not sure you can make this stuff up, especially the level of detail she gave for injuries and reactions to injuries. I buy her story\u2014hook, line, and sinker.Her interviews are factual, analytical. In fact, she\u2019s a little stoical. She seems to have intellectualized her trauma, which is a common defense mechanism. I\u2019m probably just full of it, but I\u2019m thinking that if she were a storyteller who wants to wow her audience with a wild story, she\u2019d appear more animated, less analytical. She\u2019d want to dwell on the juice, which she doesn\u2019t do. In the longer interviews, she discusses her philosophy on education\u2014not the kind of stuff that makes an audience wriggle in glee. I think of her as a reporter\u2014she reports on the madness but she also reports on the scenery (remember the mountain talk that I didn\u2019t love at first). She isn\u2019t interested in creating fiction.Airing dirty laundry.There are a few scathing 1-star reviews on Amazon by family members and friends of the family. They say that most of what Tara says isn\u2019t true, that the family is wonderful and not so isolated, that Tara\u2019s dad helped fund her college. Tara even says in her book that he helped her out financially. He didn\u2019t want her to go to college, but he didn\u2019t prevent it either. These negative reviews say that Tara is unstable (let me say that in interviews, she does not in any way appear or sound weird). Of course they would say that. What self-respecting family wouldn\u2019t be pissed at someone airing their dirty laundry? And again, it\u2019s that memory thing. Put a bunch of siblings in a room and ask them about something that happened in their childhood, and they\u2019ll all have a different memory of it. Plus there\u2019s the truth that every sibling has a unique relationship and experience with their parents and with each other. At this point, most of Tara\u2019s family (parents and a few sibs) have shunned her. I\u2019m sure that not having her family\u2019s support is killing her; a family has such power over you. No one wants their family to shun them. Luckily, she is close to a couple of brothers. In the book, she gives them credit for helping her.It\u2019s not a woman, it\u2019s a pencil!Now for some silly cover talk. For the longest time, I thought this was an artsy cover showing the back of a woman. She has this little head with long dark hair, and she\u2019s wearing a red skirt that\u2019s way bigger than her head. Then, what? OMG, it\u2019s not a woman, it\u2019s a pencil!! Very clever! Days pass before I see that there\u2019s a little person standing on the pencil! It\u2019s supposed to look like a girl standing on a mountain side, like Tara and her mountain. Wow! What an enticing and cool cover. Check out her interviews:Here are a few of the interviews I liked.

It took me through a whole gamut of my own emotions from belief to disbelief, from hesitation to doubt to wariness, and most importantly, from the weightiness of compassion and empathy to the restrictions of frustration and anger.Tara Westover tells her story straight out through the reflections seen by her own eyes, her own jagged experiences, and in her own words. As you step inside of Tara's story you will certainly have moments in which vexation will sit down right next to you and shake its head in disbelief and sorrow. Truth comes in variations of light.We live in a world in which we sift life experiences of our own and others through an internal grid. Does it shake out right in our minds? Can we relate to any of this? Or do we see the world through tunnel vision? Our experiential backgrounds, existing in the light of positivity or in the deepest caves of darkness, form the prism for which we view life. We form our values and codes of conduct normally through trial and error. We receive feedback and reinforcement, ideally, through our family unit. Tara's self-expressed reality is a reality for more individuals in some way, shape or form that we can even begin to image.There is no sugar-coating this story. Be prepared for that. Gene Westover is a self-proclaimed prophet of impending doom. His social revolutionary nature and his transfixion with his skewed religious beliefs bled into this family with dire emotional and physical consequences. His children seemed to be no more than members of a work crew who were manipulated and mind-controlled in his demands for loyalty at all costs.Faye, the mother, left a \"normally functioning\" childhood home only to be squelched under the thumb of a very sick man. She had that internal grid of right and wrong within her, initially, and buckled under to his demands at the price of her own children's well-being. No salve, no herb, no tincture can cure that, dear woman.We, as readers, watch the slow, painful motions of Tara trying to break free from this toxic environment. I rallied behind her in her transition. But I mourned her inability to warn Emily of the nightmare that she was encountering in the likes of her demented brother, Shawn, before they married. I also mourned Tara's constant returning to the seen of the crime, almost like a battered wife syndrome, seeking approval and acceptance.......seeking to be re-engaged with this dysfunctional tribe. Gene and Shawn poisoned this well.While I celebrate Tara's eventual life achievements, I know in my heart that she will always be broken inside from the entrapment she lived through and continues to live through. \"Nothing touches me\" are her own words. It is most difficult to bloom in life when your very thoughts are suffocated before they can even find a voice. It is my sincere hope that Tara's words, truth-bound or not, will reach into that darkness that exists in others right now in order for them to find their own voice. Breaking free seems like the weight of granite tied to one's ankles. Difficult, but not impossible \"if only\" the someone, somewhere were more vigilant to the plight of our neighbors. We, as a society, are so observant and wise after the fact. Seeing eyes that blur into blindness.I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to Random House and to Tara Westover for the opportunity.", "Wow! Tara Westgrove is one of the strongest, and bravest people I have ever read about! This woman grew up as the youngest child in a big survivalist, Mormon family, in Idaho at Buck Peak. So much danger for her in that life, mostly because of her father and one of her older brothers.This memoir is so brutal at times and hard to read, your heart just breaks for this girl, and for some of her siblings.Tara rises up to become extremely \u201ceducated\u201d despite the fact that she never attended school, and was barely homeschooled. Her academic achievements were fascinating to read about, especially with all the turmoil in her life.Recommended!!!!! What a story!Thank you to NetGalley and Random House for the advanced ebook!", "oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best memoir/autobiography 2018! what will happen?this is one of those \u201ceeeeveryone is reading it\u201d books that i always come in too late on, since i rarely read nonfiction and it takes me a while to jump onto nonfiction bandwagons. but here i am, way behind the rest of y\u2019all on the oregon trail, probably riddled with dysentery. or that. which is probably a good place to dive into this review, because even though its synopsis keeps stressing the word \u201csurvivalist,\u201d this family is only \"survivalist\" in the sense that somehow, despite refusing to seek professional medical treatment for any number of falls, fires, punctures, car accidents, explosions, they survived.\u00a0and somehow, in spite of being a college freshman who had never gone to school a day in her life, who thought europe was a country and had never heard of the holocaust, tara westover managed to not only survive, but flourish in academia; earning an undergrad degree, a masters, and a phd before writing this book. and somehow, despite years of emotional, psychological, and physical abuse, despite all the ways they failed to prepare her for the world, despite how they turned their backs on her and how generally unpleasant they are, she still wants the approval and acceptance of, and to have a relationship with, her family. of the three \u201csomehows,\u201d that is the least shocking. the pull of family is strong and many people continue to love people who hurt them repeatedly, but there\u2019s no world in which i teach myself trigonometry, so #2 still has my vote.it\u2019s an interesting book for a number of reasons, but maybe not the ones that are being used to pitch it. because the survivalist thing is definitely overemphasized. there\u2019s a difference between being a prepper and being prepared. you live in a rural area, like the mountains of idaho, you\u2019re gonna want to can some food in case you get cut off from other options. the family is self-sufficient and insular in many ways, but they have a phone, a tv, a car, tara participates in local musical theater groups - they\u2019re by no means \u201coff the grid.\" except for Y2K, which deeply disappointed her father by failing to happen, the family doesn\u2019t actively prepare for the breakdown of society, and there\u2019s nothing of the survivalist guns and ammo and \u201cwe live in trees now\u201d lifestyle here. the end times are mentioned, of course, but it\u2019s often invoked in a context other than survival, and although her father wants the family to become even more self-sufficient, in terms of generating power and other amenities, a lot of that is just \u201cstickin\u2019 it to the man\u201d glee. for me, what\u2019s interesting is how memory functions in this book. obviously, all memoirs are somewhat invented - gaps filled in, personalities amplified, situations inflated, meaning assigned with the clarity of hindsight, but here it\u2019s more than \u201cglossed for dramatic zazz;\u201d it\u2019s several different sources who have completely contradictory recollections of events. she makes note of these situations as they arise in the book, but there\u2019s a little two-page dealie after the acknowledgments called \u201cA Note on the Text\u201d that is totally worth reading, and weirdly, was the most fascinating part of the book, to me. it\u2019s almost eerie. trust me and check it out, okay??that\u2019s all i got - everyone\u2019s already been here, done this (LGM). it\u2019s an interesting read; i still don\u2019t know how she managed to go from nell to nerdbut more power to her, truly.come to my blog!", "FIVE STARSThis is one of those books that I can't stop talking about. Literally. My dental hygienist even wrote it down because she asked me for a good book recommendation. She likes biographies. YASSSSSSSSS! I'M READING THE BEST MEMOIR EVER!!! YOU MUST BUY IT TODAY!!! (That was in between spitting and rinsing, of course.) I love memoirs written by unusual people. Tara Westover is not only highly educated, but she is stubborn as a bulldog and pulled herself up by the steel-toed boots she wore as a child working in her family's Idaho junkyard. The first class room she ever entered was the first day of her freshman college year at age 17. She had never seen a doctor. Never had a vaccination. Never taken even an ibuprofen. She had no birth certificate. She didn't even know her birthday. She didn't know she was supposed to wash her hands after using the restroom. She had never heard of the civil rights movement or the Holocaust. Yet, despite these odds, she rose to the position of earning her Ph.D from the prestigious Cambridge University. Can you imagine the extremeness of dangerous and rural, poverty-stricken Idaho when compared to Cambridge? If you are familiar with the grand dining hall of Harry Potter's Hogwarts, you have an idea of the scale and beauty of such a hallowed site of academia. Talk about a fish out of water story. I love it!At the heart of her memoir lies Tara's unrelenting drive to be accepted by her family despite her eventual success with higher education and her rebirth into a different world altogether. She valiantly tries to stop the cycle of violence that involves her older brother. Her father was stirred by his own religious beliefs, but his mental illness was what propelled their family into doomsday mode. He was a devout survivalist and determined to take his entire family with him into the darkness.EDUCATED is a fascinating story of sheer perseverance and grit. I listened to the audiobook and it was a phenomenal production. Heartbreaking at times, but it is an ultimately uplifting and inspiring story.", "I was blown away by this book. I finished it a few days ago and can\u2019t stop thinking about it.Tara Westover grew up under the watchful eye of a survivalist and fundamentalist family. Her parents did not believe in sending children to school for fear of being brainwashed, they did not believe in doctors, hospitals or medication. Whenever a member of the family was injured they would be treated at home with tinctures, herbs, and homemade remedies. There is a lot more to the story than this brief description.The book is captivating, emotional, and powerful. The writing is beautiful and the author makes emphasis in recounting her memories and struggles as faithfully as she remembers them. Her journey is incredible and inspiring.This is one of the best memoirs I\u2019ve read and highly recommend it to all.", "So this book is billed as being along the same lines as The Glass CastleMy little nothing opinion falls around something like this.\n\nTara grows up in a different kind of family. Her dad knows that the end of the world is coming and makes sure his family is always ready. He has them preparing food constantly, digs a shelter, does not believe in association with anything government (including doctors)...mom is a midwife that practices with herbal cures. The family has strong beliefs that center them on their mountain and away from worldly things. Including school. Technically, the story is that the family is homeschooled...but there is not a whole lot of schooling going on. Unless you count working the family junkyard. (That might get you killed.)The family for the most part is okay with all this because of the simple fact that they just don't know anything else. Their dad is a force and his beliefs are held strong in the family. Tara had never heard of the Holocaust until she was almost an adult.Tara decides she has to escape from some of her family pressures unless she wants to end up pregnant and following her meek mothers footsteps. Plus, she has an older brother that is so abusive that he turned my stomach.So why didn't I fall all in love with this book? For me it repeated itself so much that I didn't think the story was ever going to move on. Some parts were just mind bogglingly boring and I almost threw it aside. But then there were parts after the first half of the book that I couldn't read fast enough. Go figure. Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review.", "I don't want to disregard Tara Westover's life experiences or not believe her, so I am going have to settle on one of two options: 1) either she is not a very good writer;2) or her memories are often faulty and/or selective, with an emphasis on the macabre and tragic, which is understandable I guess.Much of Tara's misfortunes and fortunes seem to make no sense, or not explained well in the context of her life story. There are multiple miraculous recoveries from numerous life-threatening untreated injuries, a lot of magical money appearing out of nowhere to pay for things Tara needed, a bunch benevolent men throwing opportunities and scholarships at her. Either Tara was a very naturally gifted student or an extremely hard-working student, it's hard to tell. No case was made for either of these possibilities, if I accept that she had received NO structured education. (Does BYU have such low standards BTW?)The survivalist angle was entirely overblown by publicity around this book. If anything, Tara's family was careless and sloppy, with their main oddity being not believing in modern medicine. Canning peaches is not survivalism as far as I know. And it's quite hard to claim to be closed off from the world if you have TV, phone, internet and take dance classes in town. Too much of this story smells like BS, and I am not talking about the abuse, I have no reason to doubt that. It's the details that are a complete mess. The gaslighting Tara had experienced at the hands of her family was the most compelling part of her story actually.", "Wow.Harrowing, heartbreaking, and ultimately triumphant, \nEducated\n is at times difficult to read and not at all what I expected, but I couldn't tear myself away from it.\"Mother had always said we could go to school if we wanted. We just had to ask Dad, she said. Then we could go. But I didn't ask. There was something in the hard line of my father's face, in the quiet sigh of supplication he made every morning before he began family prayer, that made me think my curiosity was an obscenity, an affront to all he'd sacrificed to raise me.\"Until she was 17 years old, Tara Westover never went to school. Her father was convinced that the government was out to get them in every way, so his children got their education at home\u2014not through books and studying, but through preparing for the End of Days by making survivalist kits, canning endless jars of fruit, and being prepared for a siege at any time.Tara's mother was a midwife and healer, so she helped her mother prepare the various tinctures and remedies she used. At other times she worked in her father's junkyard with her siblings, salvaging scrap metal and dealing with the various injuries that came with this work, because her parents didn't believe that doctors or hospitals could heal better than herbs and the Lord's power. The problem was, they were so isolated that there was no one to help ensure the children learned any actual facts, or protect them when behavior turned violent.When one of Tara's older brother's left the family compound in Idaho to study at Brigham Young University, for the first time Tara realized there was a world outside her father's blustery preaching. Despite having never set foot in a classroom, she began to study for the ACT exam, teaching herself enough math, grammar, and science to achieve the score she needed to attend BYU herself. But this decision didn't please her father, who believed college professors were liars and hypocrites sure to take Tara down a blasphemous path.In \nEducated\n, Westover shares her story about being caught between loyalty to family and God, and the desire to find your own way, to learn things on your own. She touches on learning about things like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement for the first time, and how difficult she found being on her own, dealing with the disapproval of her father.While this book deals with the educational triumphs Westover ultimately achieves despite all of the obstacles thrown in her way, this is a tough story to read as well, because she also shares what it is like to constantly have your self-worth undermined by those who claim to love you and want what's best for you. How can you ever truly believe you deserve a life in which you don't have to worry about abuse, humiliation, and degradation, when it is your own family causing these things? Where do you find the strength to say you've had enough when you know doing so might cost you your family?I'm late to the party in reading this, and I will admit this wasn't quite the book I expected, as I thought it would focus more on Westover's education than her upbringing and the emotional and physical abuse she endured for years. Obviously, this, too, was part of her education, but at times I found the continuous pattern of behaviors really difficult to keep reading about. I realize that those around her must have felt the same way\u2014just when they thought she might be making a breakthrough she let the same things happen to her over and over and over again.Even though this wasn't an enjoyable book per se, it was written so skillfully, and Westover's story was so compelling that I read the entire book in a day thanks to a flight and a long car ride.This is an important, poignant, thought-provoking book which demonstrates how one woman found the courage to achieve despite being surrounded by those who told her she shouldn't or she couldn't.

I had read so many glowing reviews for this book I was expecting greatness.... also this is absolutely not in my preferred list of genres, but this also could\u2019ve helped the book.... as I have very few books to compare it to.... I finished this book well over a week ago and I have sat on this review, because I just am not sure how to be honest without criticizing a persons life.... for this reason I may never read another memoir that I need to review, it is hard for me to separate the person from the book.... but I will try...On a very positive note I thought the message of this book was wonderful education is extremely important.... it really is one thing nobody can ever take away from you.... I do admire Tara\u2019s fortitude to acquire an education..... however there was a little luck involved here.... all I\u2019m saying is the average person of average intelligence probably isn\u2019t going to end up at Harvard.... no matter how hard they work.... clearly Tara was blessed with the intelligence to do so, and this was not addressed anywhere in this book... my father grew up with a single mother, his father passed away when he was one-year-old, they didn\u2019t have much, but his mother forced him to go to at least one year of college and he ended up with a PhD in aeronautical engineering.... now I am very proud of my father he has accomplished a lot in his life and he is an amazing person, however he was also blessed with an amazing brain... apparently this skips a generation because my son was blessed with that same amazing brain.... all I\u2019m saying is sometimes you need to give credit where credit is due.... if I had started college without knowing any algebra my freshman year I would have never made it through college much less ended up at Harvard, no matter how hard I worked..... so yes you should work hard, yes education is important, but you also need to be realistic with what your abilities are.... some of the hardest working people might end up at the local community college or not in college at all..... sorry that was a bit of a rant, rant over....There are also some things in this book I found a little hard to believe.... however I will give Tara the benefit of the doubt on this, sometimes our perception of things isn\u2019t exactly how things happened.... wow a lot of things could have been avoided if they just wore seatbelts....But really in all honesty none of the things stated above cause me to not love this book, it just did not hold my attention.... I needed some light moments in the midst of all these horrible childhood memories.... even in the worst of childhoods there are some bright spots....For me this book had a very positive message, however I would\u2019ve preferred it to be delivered in a more positive and realistic manner.... and to all of you who love this book I am so glad you did! really I wish I had as well....*** thank you to the publisher and Net Galley for a copy of this book ***"], "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Biography"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/53814228-educated", "avg_ratings": "4.47", "ShelvedNumber": "7161"}

But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it\u2019s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she\u2019s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she\u2019s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with Daisy Jones & The Six, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1580255154l/40597810.jpg", "title": "Daisy Jones & The Six", "authors": "Taylor Jenkins Reid", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six", "reviews": ["Daisy Jones & the Six is a masterpiece. Incredible. Intoxicating. Unforgettable. Truly one of the most remarkable stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The moment I finished, I had to immediately start from the beginning again. I refused to let go. And yes, I did read it twice in a row.CW: substance abuse/addiction, abortionSet in the mid sixties \u2013 late seventies, Daisy Jones & The Six transports readers to the most iconic age of rock n\u2019 roll. The atmosphere and story composition create and authentic tale that I almost refuse to believe isn\u2019t real! Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master of fiction \u2013 her characters possess an uncanny ability to charm readers and settle into their hearts. Her novels are multi-faceted and unlike any other books I\u2019ve read, especially due to the oral history storytelling of Daisy Jones. (Side note \u2013 the audiobook? SPECTACULAR. If you have access to the audio version, you will not want to miss this experience) Full of timeless quotes, glamourous scandals, and heart-breaking loss, Daisy Jones & The Six has absolutely climbed to the top as one of my favorite books of all time.FUCK! THIS BOOK IS SO FEMINIST! The women in this book are all so powerful and dynamic. There are so many strong messages about women empowerment, taking no one\u2019s shit, supporting other women, and demanding credit where it\u2019s due. Even the smaller side characters are them much more layered than most supporting characters, as we explore their own storylines. Plus the relationships between all of the women, (Karen & Daisy, Karen & Camila, Camila & Daisy \u2013 even Daisy and little Julia made my heart swell!) are wholesome, unique, and authentic. Especially for a story with a bit of a love triangle, I could not be happier with the superb study of the experience of women.I also was left so touched by the exploration of addiction. It\u2019s a disease very close to my heart and I\u2019m so, so pleased with how Taylor Jenkins Reid captured the dark, devastating nature of it. The story of both Billy and Daisy\u2019s respective addictions bring light to the glamorization of drugs of this time, while not glamorizing it themselves. This book exposes the truth about substance abuse while simultaneously carrying an air of hope and recovery for those who may be in a similar situation. I\u2019ll stand by this novel my grave as one of the greatest fictional stories of addiction ever told.And oh gosh, THE MUSIC! I just have to give a shout out to the author for writing so many superb original songs with their own distinct voice and sound. I cannot WAIT for the series to come out so I can finally hear these marvelous lyrics sung the way they should be. Again, I REFUSE to believe this isn\u2019t a real band.I have so few complaints about this book, and honestly, they are so minuscule compared to the novel\u2019s countless strengths. I felt the main plot twist wasn\u2019t all that shocking and the ending could have been stronger compared to the rock-solid build up, but I\u2019m so enchanted by this book that I\u2019m totally unbothered.In sum, read Daisy Jones & The Six. Prepare to have your mind rocked by the story of a band that wanted to change the world, so they did.", "I know many people loved this book, and it's not as if I don't see why, but this choice of narration just really didn't work for me. I found Reid's The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo absolutely riveting from the very first chapter, but I thought the decision to write this book entirely in interview transcripts made it really boring and emotionless.Daisy Jones & The Six is essentially a band documentary transcript. I'm sure most of you have seen a band documentary before. Former band members, their managers, and their friends are all interviewed, and the screen switches between them speaking and images/footage of the band in their prime. This is like that, but without the images to accompany it. Members of The Six, their acquaintances, and Daisy herself, recount the history of the band's rise and fall.I just\u2026 nothing interested me. I didn\u2019t care when they were bickering about how song lyrics should go. Or when they were talking about the sex and drugs lifestyle. They just fly around, play gigs, do drugs, all while Daisy is being a brat and Billy is cheating on his wife. They are the only two characters of interest and they both irritated me.Perhaps it is because this is a perfect example of what they say a writer shouldn't do: all tell, no show. I mean, that's the nature of having it be an interview transcript. The characters just talk about their experiences, and it all felt very cold and detached. I wasn't immersed in the story; I wasn't experiencing it. I actually kept reading because the book seemed like maybe it was building to something good. It all feels like its leading up to a shocking climax at their last concert, but even the mystery surrounding that was unsatisfying for me. I was expecting something more juicy and exciting.Oh well. I do think it had a bit of a cool 1970s LA music scene vibe going on. The whirlwind of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and all that. But it wasn't enough for me. I think the story would have been far more compelling written in the author's usual style. She seems quite good at writing about strong feisty women who get caught up in a vicious industry, but that didn't come across as well here.

Truly I loved this book and enjoyed the unique, original, intriguing, captivating writing style!!!Felt like I watched an amazing documentary while I\u2019m reading an exhilarating book. It\u2019s an unforgettable ride with full of not much sex, but too much drugs and rock&roll. I love the lyrics, especially \u201c Impossible woman\u201d, \u201c Regret me\u201d and \u201c Turn it off\u201d and of course \u201c A hope like you\u201d!Welcome to the 70\u2019s world with the rising of a rock band, smashing egos of group members, emotional turmoils, pain of creativity and performing!I loved the forbidden love story. I love all the characters, they were flawed, natural, fighting with their demons by their own ways! I have to congratulate the writer who successfully brings back 70\u2019s rock and roll atmosphere objectively without any exaggeration. I loved this book! I loved the six who are really struggling to be part of something. And Daisy, she was emotional, lost, impulsive, spoiled, broken but also a gifted star who falls for the one she can never have! I loved this band\u2019s journey and enjoyed every second of it!Now so glad to hear that Reese Witherspoon\u2019s production company bought the rights to turn this book to a wonderful Amazon series!

There was a lot of potential but I felt like the story wasn't flesh out enough. I highly recommend listening to this one as an audiobook due to the format (interviews). Reminded me a bit of A Star Is Born, but maybe less tragic and with a very confident main female character. The characters were definitely attaching but I felt like there should have been more. 300 pages of interview is quite short.Overall good, would recommend but not a favorite!", "\nI will never stop cryingCheck out my book review!: https://youtu.be/pJvJi3HVzf0\n", "\nAnyone else furious that the songs in the book aren't actual songs you can stream right now CAUSE I AM.\n", "\nVideo review - https://youtu.be/w9617uq7Kk0?t=752I AM SO EMOTIONAL\n", "i finally got my hands on the audio of this and it is everything i thought it would be - the authenticity, the intrigue, the drama, the rock n\u2019 roll, the emotion. this is a masterpiece and the six are the life and soul of this story. i CANNOT wait for the day when their songs become streamable on spotify. ___________________________________________there has been some sort of mistake. this book is labelled as fiction, but that cant be right. there is no way these people arent real and nothing you say will convince me otherwise. daisy jones & the six were the greatest rock \u2019n roll band of the 70s and thats the tea, henny. but in all seriousness. TJR is taking this genre of faux-biographies/interviews and really making it a thing; but more specifically, her thing. between this and \u2018the seven husbands of evelyn hugo,\u2019 there is proof that fiction will forever be more appealing than nonfiction. no real life event could be told like the way TJR tells her stories. i am just in awe of her capabilities as an author. \u2018daisy jones & the six\u2019 is so unique, so edgy, so sexy, so daring, so raw. its everything i could want and hope for from a story about a rock \u2019n roll band. and if i had such an amazing experience reading this, i cant even imagine what listening to the audiobook will be like (i kind of wish i had done that first, just because of how the story is presented as a compilation of commentary from interviews) - its gonna blow my tiny little mind! i honestly cant wait!\u21a0 5 stars", "Apparently I read a different book than everyone else. Or maybe my brain just thinks it's funny to make me hate hyped books idk. This didn't touch me whatsoever. I was bored and the story and some actions of the characters felt repetitive to the point that I skipped some paragraphs. Everything was so predictable and dialogues even felt pretentious sometimes.

I'm a mess. I'm such a hot mess. I feel like Daisy on crack. I'm a crying mess, I'm a screaming mess, I'm a heartbroken mess.

I'm literally on Youtube right now, trying to find a cover of these songs or anything. I'm so deep I'm gonna fall off. I'm supposed to watch the Oscars in a few hours, and here I am, crying over a fictional rock band.I have had such a weird history with this book from the get go. You can check out the date I started reading it, fucking March of 2019. You know it's February of 2020 now right? Yeah. I read a 100 pages of this book on March of 2019, in book format and then my book hiatus started. It wasn't because of this book, it just happens to me from time to time. I remember I actually bought it right after I started hearing all the buzz about it, and after having loved her previous work I knew I was gonna love this. But I couldn't have known it would change something in me.And then we come to today. I'm back from my book hiatus, ready to read some good things because it comes back again. And after I read 2 books this year, I saw that I had left this one behind. So, to make things easier for myself, I decided to listen to the audiobook. Which was so praised by everyone when it came out. I have never listened to an audiobook, I can't find myself concentrating to it. Maybe it's because I'm bilingual, or that my mind can't linger on to something for a very long period of time, idk. But I knew this particular audiobook would enhance my experience. Therefore, I started a 30-trial on audible, downloaded it and started listening while also reading it.It's one of those books were you check if the band was real, if the people actually existed and you're so convinced it's true. You just know they do because this book feels like it. I feel like calling these people and hear their stories and struggles and worries. I feel like I want to meet them and talk to them. I feel like I want to be them, despite their flaws. That's how perfectly constructed most of these characters are. I don't know how this author does it with each of her books. How can she make up actual people who feel so like... actual people? So raw, and flawed and complex. Worlds were black and white doesn't exist... but grey does. Like the real world. This woman is a true talent and I will read everything she writes, I swear. I'm just so captivated. I love rock, I love metal, I love pop. I just love music and rock bands and old music and sometimes new and I just knew I would be drawn to the subject matter of this book. But I never thought it would much more than a rock band book. That it would feel so personal sometimes. That I would sympathize with those people that have nothing in common with me. But the God, named Taylor Jenkins Reid fucking DID THAT!Overall, read this motherfucking book. Or at best... listen to the audiobook while reading it, speed 2.0. I flew through it in 5 hours, I didn't even drink water. Trust me, don't even pick up this book without listening to the audiobook. K bye!", "\nReally enjoyed this!

I\u2019ve been thinking about \u201cDaisy Jones and The Six\u201d for days: .....the story, the creative structure, the characters as individuals and in relationship to one another: written superbly!!!As for \u2018emotions\u2019.....and \u2018reflecting\u2019....I\u2019m still engaged \u2014 as this soulful novel is more than drugs, sex, and rock-n-roll......its a novel that speaks to our own losses and loves. This book broke my heart and mended it. The authenticity of these mult-dimensional characters have us relating to how similar & universal our inner voices are. It becomes totally clear yet so complex to understand how we can love somebody but not be happy with the way things are. This novel\u2019s achievement is deeply moving - irresistible- and the real beauty is that it FEELS TOTALLY ALIVE....made with REAL VIBRANT ENERGY!There are written songs - that I can\u2019t wait to \u2018hear\u2019. The mini series can\u2019t come fast enough for me\u2014-I\u2019m a fiction-rock-band-book-groupie!!! Guilty pleasure- out of the closet!!!While reading this novel - there were parts where I wished I had bought tickets to the live show \u2014 I would have given anything to hear Daisy and Billie sing together. A couple of times they were soooo vulnerable- you could cut the air tension with a knife. Bottom line..... extraordinary......brilliant....heartbreaking...depth....and beauty.LAST..... some thoughts as to \u2018why\u2019 I think Taylor Jenkins Reid is popular...with \u2018strong-loyal-fans\u2019......( I admit to being one of them - having read every book she has written).....MOST: TJR makes us *FEEL*.....we often get a lump in our throat in her novels.....Stories always move smoothly.....Her characters are complex - broken & beautiful- powerful & fragile - .....Simple moments - mundane moments are so real - we relate. .....Storytelling is wise, witty, smart, devastating, inspiring, often consumed by passion and love.....Her stories have us thinking \u201cwhat might we do?\u201d......Taylor Jenkins Reid skillful writing transfers into real experiential tales....she can crawl inside our heads and have us laughing one minute - worried the next - .....when it comes to creating powerful - glamorous- female characters - TJR is the \u2018go-to\u2019 author.....at the same time she knows how to capture the quiet behind the scenes powerful woman equally as well. .....None of her books are the same - yet we trust we will be taken on an entertaining unpredictable journey.

This audiobook was one of the best audiobooks I've ever listened to and I am SO GLAD that I decided to take in the story that way. It was narrated by a full cast and I just about died when my girl Judy Greer started speaking in my ear as the voice of Karen Karen. Seriously y'all, so fucking good. I WILL SAY, the reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because the book as a whole ends a little unspectacularly. There's so much build up and tension throughout the course of the book and the ending just did not live up to what came before it. I do still HIGHLY recommend you check it out though, and 100% recommend the audiobook. What a wild ride.TW: copious drug use, alcoholism, abortion", "What does one say when one loves a book except that they loved it? I just read this in one sitting and spent all day reading it. I couldn't put it down. Actually though it was funny because at first I had thought this was fiction, but then I was reading it and I'm like no this is non fiction. I ask my boyfriend if he had heard of the band and he's like no what are you talking about and then later I was looking it up and I found out that no the book is actually just fiction and then I felt like an idiot and I don't know why I was feel emotional today so I just started crying that the book tricked me and my boyfriend was just like what. That's really all I have to share about this. I really enjoyed reading this, would totally recommend it. The pacing and build up was really good honestly and it kept me engaged the whole time. Definitely one of the best things I've read this year, but it's also only January, and like I said I'm also really emotional today, probably because I have a cold and took tons of cold meds, so not sure how reliable an opinion this is.** Update now that I'm not on meds and everything isn't making me super emotional: I want to stand by what I wrote yesterday. I really enjoyed the book. I think the complexity of the characters, the relationship dynamics and the portrayal of love is what really appealed to me. Just wanted to say that now that I have a renewed ability to be articulate. I also thought the transcript/interview format worked really well for the book and I think that can be hard to pull off.

But, the audiobook presentation is 5 stars, no doubt! The full cast experience as though it all really happened was riveting. I was reminded of VH1 Behind the Music.Another thing I was reminded of was A Star Is Born. The chemistry between the characters and the battles against self destruction are strong themes in both. If you are a fan of that movie, I think you will find a lot to enjoy here.Speaking of characters - this is a fabulous character study book. And, while there are lots of them, it is not difficult to keep them straight and get invested in their journey. There are a couple of characters that I kept forgetting about that would show up from time to time but didn't add too much extra. I think they represented that in every great band, there are always one or two who are just along for the ride.Music fans, Classic Rock fans, documentary fans, or fans of a genre close to these, I definitely think this is worth a shot and I definitely recommend the audiobook.", "There's no doubt that the 1970's was an amazing decade for music. The rock genre took the world by storm, selling out arenas and gathering heretofore unheard of crowds of obsessed fans. Groups such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster Cult, Boston, and Queen were living large with lifestyles infused with sex, drugs and rock and roll. This novel is the fictional profile of one such band, Daisy Jones & the Six.Told via a highly creative interview format, Daisy Jones & The Six is an exceptional example of that format done wisely. This felt like an episode of VH1's Behind the Music on steroids! We follow the band from its very inception, through the process, ups-and-downs and the dynamics between the various members of the group.I have to admit that Daisy was a frustrating character for me to read. I just found her to be selfish and I found myself frequently wishing I could shake some sense into her. My favorite character by far was Karen. I really connected with her and could read an entire novel with her as the main.I started my read of this switching back and forth between my hard copy and the audiobook. Roughly 35% in, it was clear the audiobook is absolutely the best way to inhale this story. I highly recommend that experience.The full cast truly draws you in. I felt like these people were real. I wanted to hear their songs, buy their album and hang their posters on my wall. Billy had me fangirling like I was in Junior High all over again.This was my first Taylor Jenkins Reid and I was definitely impressed. She writes with such skill. I cannot wait to pick up some of her other books. Obviously, Evelyn Hugo will be next. I just hope the hype for that holds up as well as this one did!", "oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for BEST HISTORICAL FICTION 2019! what will happen?THIS happened! WINNER! goodreads choice awards best historical fiction 2019!#ReadWithMC review round-up: https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a...I used to care when men called me difficult. I really did. Then I stopped. This way is better.this is a breeeeezy zip of a book. it\u2019s written in a gossipy, fragmented way, using snippets of \u201cbehind the music\u201d-style interviews to chronicle the rise and fall; the relationships, adventures, and misadventures of a fictional 70s rock band called daisy jones & the six, which is apparently modeled after fleetwood mac. reid\u2019s frothy trip down imaginary rock and roll lane is shaped as a book-in-the-making, allowing former band members, rock critics, producers, friends and lovers the opportunity to supply or respond to other participants\u2019 admissions concerning all the seamy behind-the-scenes dirt that is part and parcel of fame\u2019s mythos - the resentments, the sex and drinking and drugs, the creative differences, the posturing; the whole roiling emotional toll of the rock and roll lifestyle.there\u2019s a special emphasis on the burdens and perceptions and scrutiny that comes with being a woman in the industry, and in a band numbering seven people, the juggling of egos and managing status and contribution and consensus becomes a real issue along with the compromises one makes for commercial viability, being an artist vs. being a star, personal/artistic sacrifices made for the good of the band \u2014 and things get, as the kids say, complicated.although reid has to construct these personas using only what is essentially a series of monologues, she does it well and consistently, and there\u2019s some fun to be had in observing who among the characters are forthright, who politely declines to answer, or whose memories differ or contradict the memories of others. this makes for a little subtext of a story about how memories change over time, how situations are interpreted based on a participant\u2019s perspective or the filter of hindsight, or how misunderstandings, when allowed to go unchallenged, often snowball into bigger problems than they ought to have.in a related theme, it\u2019s interesting to see how this phenomenon transcends the interpersonal level and is carried out into the legend of the band - how lyrics are interpreted, misinterpreted, how rumors grow around them, how situations are inflated for a juicier tale, and how the press operates as kingmakers - creating or perpetuating the aura of stardom on the slimmest of pretexts.it\u2019s a fun, light summertime book sprinkled with great lines. the best one? Karen was the kind of person who had more talent in her finger than most people have in their whole body\u2026and don\u2019t you forget it.********************************reading for marieclaire.com\u2019s all-lady-authors book club#ReadWithMCcome to my blog!", "Is there anyone in their 60s or older that doesn\u2019t see the cover for this book, read the summary and doesn\u2019t immediately think of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac? Reid does a great job capturing that sense of stardom; the sex, drugs and rock n roll. I love how this book is written, as if it is a history of an actual band, as if it\u2019s a compilation of interviews with everyone involved. It was wild to see how different things said or done were misinterpreted or remembered differently by others. I had to keep reminding myself it wasn\u2019t based on a real group, the characters just seemed that real. It will be fascinating to see how the mini-series, being produced by Reese Witherspoon for Amazon plays out. This is a super fast read and an engrossing one. I enjoyed The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but I really loved this. Billy\u2019s comment \u201cDrinking, drugging, sleeping around, it\u2019s all the same thing, you have this line you won\u2019t cross. But then you cross them. And suddenly you possess the very dangerous information that you can break the rule and the world won\u2019t instantly come to an end.\u201d Reid really made me feel the different addiction problems that first Billy and then Daisy faced, including the fight to stay sober. It also took me back to the sexual discrimination that was just accepted back in the day. We all felt we just had to deal with it. I loved that Daisy didn\u2019t; how she was able to ignore the \u201crules\u201d. \u201cI am not a muse.I am a somebody.End of fucking story.\u201dAnd yes, I realize I\u2019m gushing, but\u2026 when Reid is writing about how Daisy and Billy wrote their songs together, it made me think of all the great songwriting duos, like McCartney and Lennon. And the dynamics of the band brought back to mind all the stories of band breakups from my youth. Reid really captured the egos and the tensions rubbing against the desire to be famous and rich. And kudos, TJR, for actually writing complete songs and including them in the back of the book. Trust me, this is one you want to read. It\u2019s going to be one of the most talked about books of the spring. My thanks to netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book. ", "Taylor Jenkins Reid's strength lies in her ability to write realistic characters and relationships and take you through a whole life journey. This book has all the elements that we love about Evelyn Hugo: a unique storytelling format, a life story, a notorious historical setting, an iconic main character, a tumultuous and very human relationship, etc. It's the same formula, but switched with different variables, and therefore I think how much you resonate with those variables depends on personal taste and subjectivity. Evelyn Hugo matched what I liked, but Daisy Jones did not. I personally did not connect to this story or care for the characters, but I don't fault the author for that. I think I felt lukewarm for this book due to having spent most of my life mentally blocking out family & friends who deal with addiction and tumultuous relationships as a survival tactic, and therefore I am unable to connect to the subject matter as deeply. I commend Taylor's skill at writing realistically imperfect relationships, even though it was a miss for me and my own preferences.", "Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a 2019 Ballantine Books publication. Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll! I mean, that\u2019s what the seventies were all about, man!! Right? Taylor Jenkins Reid has done an admirable job of creating the atmosphere and mindset of the seventies and the rock bands that were catapulted to success beyond their wildest dreams. From their humble incarnation to their mega-stardom, to their slide down into relative obscurity, the author takes us on a journey back to the days when the music meant everything, the bands were serious about their art, and the rock and roll lifestyle either made you or it broke you. To tell the band\u2019s storied history, the author employs a documentary style format, which is an interesting approach. It works in some ways, but it falls flat in others. As other reviewers have pointed out, the fictional band featured in this story is a thinly veiled Fleetwood Mac prototype. Again, this works to some extent because many people are familiar with the outrageous dramas within the band and it feels a bit familiar, and therefore plausible. But, at the same time, I did wish this fictional band had not borne such a close resemblance to an actual group. I thought it took something away from the story, as it was less imaginative than it could have been. However, this might be what made the book appealing to some readers. That said, as the story progresses, and the band follows an all too familiar and cliched path, riddled with pitfalls, drugs, relationship woes, and all manner of inner turmoil and temptation, the story makes an ever so subtle shift into something a little more substantial than the typical \u2018Behind the Music\u2019 \u2018Rockumentary\u2019 type of story.Although the characters\u2019 personas are very recognizable, they are also very well constructed and unique in their own way. They do prompt emotions, but are still enigmas, in the same way the rock stars of the seventies often were, adding to, and maintaining their mystique. The downside to that gamble is that one may not feel a deep connection with them. While those thoughts were whirling around in my head, the realization that I'd finally become invested in the welfare of the band snuck up on me. I did, finally, find myself wrapped up in the drama, and was torn by the difficult choices that the characters made, questioning some, understanding others, but ultimately making peace with the way everything came together in the end.  I will confess I was very much looking forward to this book and with all the rave reviews I was confident this one would blow me away. But, as much as I love this author and wanted to love this book, it didn't rock my world- so to speak. Don't get me wrong, I did like the book, but it didn\u2019t come close to packing the emotional punch of Evelyn Hugo, and I thought it had the potential to do so. However, the big reveal in this case, which was centered around the group's final performance, was anticlimactic, in my opinion. Still, this is one many will find compulsively readable, and some will enjoy the feelings of nostalgia the story evokes. In some ways the story feels like an alternate reality for the real rock band the story is so obviously based on, which is also a thought provoking and interesting concept. Overall, although this one didn't have the impact on me, I'd hoped, I still enjoyed it for the most part. Due to the style and format, it is a very easy read, and many will be able to finish it off in one day or even in one sitting.  A little Fleetwood Mac playing in the background will make some nice mood music to go along with the saga of Daisy Jones and the Six. 3.5 rounded up.", "\ni love karen with my whole entire heart.Aug 10, 2019 update:I talk more about why I didn't love this one in my recent reads video here: youtu.be/bM5Wh7rpwSQBut honestly, I just really struggled to particularly care or connect with most of the characters, and the ending was How I Met Your Mother-level bad.

It's a story about a girl who grew up to be an icon, an inspiration, a rockstar, a woman who independently grew up willing to do something in order to make her life better and live the life she had always dreamed to live. But that's not the only thing this story is about.This story is about a band who rose to fame and called the top of the charts theirs, their name sitting on the throne like they owned everyone and everything. It's about a band who struggled with communication, love, jealousy, anger, drug abuse, addiction, and, most importantly, friendship. This is a story about these band members telling their parts of the story and how everyone settled in, letting out their secrets out so everyone can know what happened, why, when, and how. It's about people who dealt with love and loss and how giving up will not get you anywhere.Content/trigger warnings: (view spoiler)[Drug addiction/abuse, abortion, underage drinking.

It is filled with interviews, song lyrics, and it told as an oral history. We have Daisy, our coming of age girl who grew up in LA wanting to rise in the late 60s. She becomes independent as she is getting no moral support from her family and parents, so her only chances are moving out and living on her own, taking care of herself like she always has. She grows up going to bars, sleeping with older guys, and starts drinking and doing drugs at a young age, but she also wants people to see her for who she is: a girl who finds drugs and sex thrilling but also want to perform at the Whisky a Go Go as she also has a love for rock and roll. When she makes her debut, not only are her vocals getting noticed but so are her looks and her beauty.The Six, a band started off by two brothers, are also hoping to make it to the music industry and rock out with the world. As they are making some progress and begin to hit the road together, Billy finds out his girlfriend, Camila, is pregnant. Unsure how to react and take the news, Billy turns to the drugs and drinks in order to hide his frustration and pour everything out. While on the road, the band and Billy are unable to settle in together as Billy is having trouble sorting everything out.When The Six and Daisy are set to collaborate and make a duet together, arranged by their producer, the pathway and journey they all take together is still legendary. The rise to their fame happened this way, but so did many other things. Told by the members themselves in interviews and transcripts, the making of the band who was taking over the 70s is told chronologically by the members themselves, revealing their past and present, future plans, and why, after their last performance at the Chicago Stadium, the band decided to never again play together.\n\nIf the rest of the world was silver, Daisy was gold.\n\nI want to say that I know a lot about the 60s through the 80s, but that would be the first thing I would be lying about. I hate to disappoint my history teachers this way, but the era and time of the 70s have never been an interest of mine. Not only that, but classic rock and roll and the rise of artists know as legendary today have never been my style. Growing up, I never found this type of history interesting. From the politics to the astonishing shift between the American system, to the movements and the rise of the artists, the years between the 1960s to the end of the 1980s has always been something I would consider boring. Not only that, but this was never something I learned about until I started eighth grade. Growing up with parents from a whole different country than America and hearing them say Oh yeah these songs have been out since I was very young but I never learned the name of the artists or the actual words was a constant struggle as legendary artists remain on top charts and sit on their thrones while, in the meantime, I'm trying to figure out the rest of the history that happened before and after everything else.The tiniest bit of history\u2014because we all love it\u2014surrounds the book, but not so much as expected. We have this world in LA that is full of peace, love, drugs, sex, and so much rock and roll. The members take us to their past life as they embark on their journey to different cities and states. The rising artists that began their fame the from the 60s to the 80s still remain to be known, but the time and era of the 70s have even been quoted as \"impossible to sum up\" because so much happened during that decade. From band splits to new albums, future icons born, solo debuts to be out, serial killers being sentenced, the most magical place in the US built, and political statements and overviews released, the 70s hold a true and tremendous amount of cheerful yet dark sides, just like every era does.If you're a fan of the 70s, this book won't give you anything you're asking for. It will not talk to you about the debut solo diva Dianna Ross made, The Beatles split and last album, the protests against the Vietnam War and the shootings made, the deaths of artists that remain iconic, inspiration, and as role models for rock fans. It will not give you the background of Nixon making political decisions, the first feminism wave, the goodbye's to fashion icons and hello's to the new fashion figures, the deaths made by serial killers, Walt Disney World being created, The Ramone's first album, the controversy about the Vietnam War, the smash hit tv shows, the legendary sport events and its history marks, the rise of artists varying from the genres rock, R&b and pop, including Pink Floyd, Queen, Aerosmith, David Bowie, Elvis Presley, Lef Zeppelin, Cher, Elton John, and so many more icons. It will not give any stories of history made by people of color, women succeding, and protests made against everything America did not agree on. \n\nIt was America. It was tits. It was sex. It was drugs. It was summer. It was angst. It was rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nTruthfully, I will admit, I wish there was more history. But then, this book was never about U.S. and world history anyway. I mean, I don't even though what this is classified as, historical fiction or contemporary. It's hard to classify it as a historical fiction though, because the book in this book is not something that would just be forgotten and be out of print, the setting is set after WWII, and the descriptions of everything in this are still in modern society, even worse in some cases. But, I didn't read this to talk about history, I read this to learn about the history of Daisy & The Six.Daisy Jones & The Six was never calling my name, but Taylor Jenkins Reid was. It was as if she finally slammed the book to my face and telling me to read her latest novel because I'm the type of reader to join in the hype of every book years and years later, so Taylor probably knew I was never going to read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo until the hype of Daisy Jones was...kind of gone. Marking this book on hold was a bold decision, but now I have to understand the hype that keeps surrounding Evelyn Hugo's story, as it blew last year and keeps blowing up, determined to take her own high charts and sit on the throne she deserves.Gosh. There is so much drama surrounding Daisy and The Six. For starters, every member tells different sides of the stories at times, and since they are being interviewed after many years have passed by, it can be difficult for them to remember every single detail about every band member, or, overall, everyone and not an individual in particular. The drama surrounding them makes everything more angsty, I will say, and it's what kept my hopes up for this book. To begin, the writing of this is not the best for me. I didn't even know this was told as an oral history, written in interviews, set like transcripts, and told by the members themselves. I really just knew this was about a legendary band that broke up and that was it. Starting this book, though, reminded me that we should just never not just judge a book by its cover but also by its written format, and in this case, in a format of interviews. The author of the book in this book interviews the members and ask them to chronologically tell their side of their story from start to finish, and we don't only get to learn their story but also everyone else's. We get to understand every different perspective and understand the reasoning behind everything.The biggest takeaway I got from this, in the beginning, was that it was solely about a rock band and their split, but Reid delivered so much more. I anticipatedly waited for this and starting it had my hopes up way to the top of the room that everyone in my neighboorhood was able to see it. Reading about every member individually tell their story and the rest was so relaxing. It felt like I was actually watching a documentary and learning about this band that is so fictional yet feels so real. Unlike Reid herself and everyone else who has read this book, I do admit, I couldn't imagine the songs in my head and not understand how the album and band was never real, but I could imagine the characters playing, being up on the stage and letting the audience know their feelings and their emotions, taking out their anger, sadness, and happiness.Reading this felt like I was actually sitting in front of my television screen and watching \"Behind the Music\". Even though I've never actually watched every single episode, I've seen minor clips of some episodes, specifically about artists I particularly like. Now as I have finished this, I wish this was an actual documentary or any sort of adaption film, series or anything that can help me see for all the action for myself. Although I'm aware a 13-episode series is set to be adapted, I still wish this was actually a film instead of a series, but I can see why a series would be better, as the life of these ex-band members have been through the worst and best times and putting it all together in a 2 to 3 hour film wouldn't be the best. I'd also like to add that I read this and I didn't listen to the audiobook (as I am not a fan of them) but I do know there is a particular and whole cast that narrates the book, each given a specific member to voiceover, and I've also heard its highly recommended because not only are you reading but it's as if you're actually listening to the real members tell their story.You know, I'm not a big crier with books. The only time I actually cry are the times when an animal dies, a male character is crying, or a female is so relatable that her crying reasons just hit me hard. We know what happens to the band. We know they split, but we don't know why, and when I started this, I was rooting for everybody, but, most importantly, I was rooting for the women. I know for a fact that Taylor creates unforgettable female characters in her books. After reading this, I've been wanting to binge-read every other book she has published and I was considering buying them on Amazon, but then I realized I'm on a book buying ban unless I really want the book. Gosh, reading every perspective of the three women\u2014Daisy, Karen, and Camila\u2014made me see how much progress has been made on women's rights and its empowerment. Although there is still so much controversy against feminism, Daisy Jones and the Six slapped me in the face and woke me up to realize women have always been strong, capable, independent, and can have so much capability to do so much in the world without men having to get up in their business. Although there is so much feminism in this, there is also ache and love for men the women have here, all three of them. Daisy and Camila are both in love with Billy, and we know that. We know from the synopsis that Billy has a family and we know that there is chemistry between Billy and Daisy, and although I wished I hated it, I didn't...not the fullest. \n\nL.A. is full of men just waiting for some naive girl to believe their bullshit.\n\nDaisy is seen as unlikeable by many, but I was rooting for her. She had everything settled and planned out, and every time she did, it went according to her way. She didn't take shit from anyone, men mostly, and she always had to have it her way, and it was fucking powerful. What I will admit is that Daisy was a character who did need someone in her life to love her back and care for her. She had her best friend, but I felt like Daisy needed someone in her life who could share everything with her, tell her their secrets, do things with her, fill her life with more happiness and send sparks of light along the way. This story also focuses on Daisy and her struggle with addiction, staying sober, and not bothering to listen to what anyone says. Sure, she didn't take shit from anyone, and it's so cool seeing a woman stand up for her beliefs during those years, but I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that Daisy needed someone to be able to understand what she's going through and be able to try and piece her back together, because Daisy could not handle doing it alone.Daisy, to me, was a character who was lonely and needed to connect with someone. When she thought she found her true love, her person, her lover, her partner, her soul mate, the person she could feel the most connection with, she was right but she knew she couldn't have him, and it hurt man. Seeing Daisy breaking down even more over the fact that she's in love with the man who she has seen become a better person and see raise his family is so heartbreaking. But then, seeing Daisy not allow herself to be let down and just shut down from it is so strong of her too, and I truly think that if the year today was in the 70s and even early 80s, Daisy would have been such a role model for many people, and not just women. She was angry, jealous, loved, alone, and scared. She was a character with so much sympathy even at the times that you wanted to yell at her, shake her, and tell her to get a grip because all she was thinking about was herself and nobody and nothing else. But then, with the minor complaints I have about her, Daisy was such a radical woman.\n\nI run hot and I always have. I am not going to sit around sweating my ass off just so men can feel more comfortable. It\u2019s not my responsibility to not turn them on. It\u2019s their responsibility to not be an asshole.\n\nI never enjoy reading about love triangles, but Taylor can either rip you apart or anger you wish these three. She puzzles three different characters that begin to heal one another in different ways than the others do, and it either angers you or just breaks your heart. I said I'm not the crier, and instead of crying, I got mad. Frustrated. I got angry with Taylor for creating these broken characters that just didn't know what to do at times. She decided to make decisions difficult for all of them, but she also put barriers and signs in front of them that they were able to see and think of them as not only warning signs but signs that are meant for their future to keep growing and moving its way forward.\n\nI really felt like I understood him. And I think he understood me. You know, things like that, that kind of connection with a person, it is sort of like playing with fire. Because it feels good, to be understood. You feel in sync with a person, you feel like you\u2019re on a level that no one else is.\n\nI know that this book also primarily focuses on the other band members, but every band member in this got in my nerves, other than Karen (at times). There was so much lack in communication that it made it very hard for the band to agree or disagree on everything, especially with Billy. I could understand where he was coming from, but Billy also needed to understand that there was really no leader in the band. What bothered me the most from his character was that he felt like he was a sort of leader and he referred to the band as his but never thought about everyone else. Sometimes he got on my nerves but then as we got to the ending, it all made sense as to why he was being so honest, so open, and unafraid to say the truth. Another thing I'd like to point out is how Billy was making his best effort to stay sober, healthy, and ready for his family. Seeing as how he did everything because of his family and because of the chances Camila gave him was so beautiful. It was a true meaning of what family can do and how it can really change a person.Although this book is called Daisy Jones and The Six, reading this felt like I was reading about Daisy and Billy struggling to understand they were not able to be together and the feeling they had for each other had to be forgotten. The angst they gave me because of the chemistry they had was attaching all the strings together. But Billy and Daisy were a puddle of their own: they knew they couldn\u2019t be connected and there was going to be somebody to break them apart. \n\nIt\u2019s an album about the push and full of stability and instability. It\u2019s about the struggle that I live almost every day to not do something stupid. Is it about love? Yeah, of course it is. But that\u2019s because it\u2019s easy to disguise almost anything as a love song.\n\nHonestly, I was unsure of my feelings when I finished this. Going into it, I was scared, especially because I didn't want to be on any minority. Seeing as how I'm feeling about this, this deserves much more than it's given. Daisy Jones & The Six delivers messages and portrayals about friendships that were never meant to last, families that were broken and love that was never meant to happen. It's all fun and games while it's lasting, but nothing ever lasts forever and knowing that this band was not going to make it until the end since the beginning brought actual anger to me because I hated that I was rooting for people I knew wouldn't root for each other. Not everyone will like this, but I believe it had to be read by me. I'd like to end this by saying that I believe my feelings for this had to do with how I was feeling while I was reading it. If I'm being honest, while reading this from the 22nd to the 25th of March, I was not emotionally and mentally healthy in any way. I think one of the biggest reasons why I truly enjoyed this, even with the small quibbles I can point out, is because I lessened the pain I was feeling as I was reading about the pain these characters were feeling, and I just think that is so strong of the book to be able to do, have me experience compassion for fictional characters while healing myself.", "Have you ever felt like there were two versions a book out there. There's the version everyone you know read. The one with the raving reviews. The one that everyone loved. Then there is the version you read. The one that is underwhelming and dry and was nothing at all like what you expected it to be. Have you ever felt that? Because I feel that sometimes.This is one such time.Seriously though, did I read the same book as everyone else?I was hoping beyond all hope that this would be my first 5-star book of 2019. Yeah, that's right, it's officially April, the FOURTH MONTH OF THE YEAR, and I have yet to read a book that blows me away. And with all the hype around this one, I was really hoping this would be it.It was not!So, maybe I'm heartless. Maybe I'm just uncool and don't understand what the cool kids are into these days. Maybe this book has some deeper meaning that my immature mind just could not comprehend. Maybe I just suck. Maybe this book secretly sucks too.Maybe it just wasn't for me.It was probably that last one.But also maybe not.First of all, these characters. I disliked them all. And I know that they aren't supposed to be likable. They are actually all supposed to be total a**holes. I get that. But even horrible people need to be likable, or at least interesting for the book to work. I personally didn't care for any of them. Daisy was a total brat. She was mean and spoiled and I just wanted someone to slap some sense into her. She was also the most special of all the snowflakes. It was always mentioned how she was just naturally better than everyone else, how everything came easy to her, and how she was just so absolutely amazing.Billy was also a jerk, although he was written to be a bit sympathetic. He's a crappy husband and a terrible friend and just overall controlling and kind of annoying.All the other characters feel only half developed and kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.Overall, I didn't like this. Obviously.\u00a0I thought I would love it. I didn't. Many of you would like it, I think. It's obvious by the hype that a lot of you do.The book is told through interviews and is very character oriented, meaning that there is basically no actual objective to the plot. That said, I didn't like the characters so this book was not a good match for me.I hope you like it if you do read it though!

She wrote one of my favorites books of all time, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, that means more to me than I have words to even begin to express. But this? This was just boring, and crude, and told in such a bad format. It\u2019s like mini interviews if you will, where multiple people are talking, but it was impossible for me to ever be immersed. I suppose the main focus is on Daisy Jones, though, and her childhood and rise to stardom. She has a really rough childhood, and got into a lot of drugs, but eventually got really famous. We get to meet her other band mates, and other people in the music scene that changed her life, but all these voices feel disjointed and chaotic. This was really difficult to read, even with all the notes I was taking. I don\u2019t care about Eddie, or Graham, or Warren, or Billy, or Rod, or Camila, or Karen Karen *eye roll forever*. Honestly? I don\u2019t even care that much about Daisy; I just feel bad for her. Simone was my favorite, easily, but even their voice wasn\u2019t enough for me to continue on. \n\n\u201cI learned about sex and love the hard way.

Maybe I\u2019ll try this one again closer to the release date, but right now this just doesn\u2019t feel like the book for me. But take this review with a grain of salt because it is being adapted into a series for Amazon Prime, which Reese Witherspoon is producing. Also, as of now, this has a lot of five star reviews.

And it doesn\u2019t get much more obviously broken and classically beautiful than Daisy Jones.\nI so connected to this book as it took me back to my teen years of the 1970\u2019s in which music, specifically rock n roll, played a huge part. My now husband and I were always traveling to big concert events in our late teens. One of the most memorable was on July 30, 1978, where we stood in the sweltering heat just feet from the stage listening to the awesome band, Fleetwood Mac, and lead singer, Stevie Nicks. We even \u2018slept\u2019 outside on the stadium sidewalk the night before just so we could be the first in the doors the next morning. While this book is fictional, I can\u2019t help but think it is loosely based on Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks.I totally enjoyed the unique format in which this was written. We get short snippets of thoughts from a wide variety of characters. It reads as if there is a documentary interview going on without hearing the questions, only the answers pertinent to the storyline in a chronological order of events.It is a re-telling of the past in their own words. The re-telling of how \u201cDaisy Jones and the Six\u201d got started, the ups and downs, the pains and hurts, the rampant drug use, the clashing of personalities. And ultimately how the band came to an end during the tumultuous 70\u2019s era.This is a compelling, fast paced page turner written by one of my favorite authors.*Thank you to Random House-Ballantine Books and Net Galley for an advanced copy in exchange for my honest review.*", "This was the most perfect audiobook I've ever listened to.

I can say that if I had read it instead, I would have given this a lower rating. I can't get over my feelings for this book. I am still processing and I warn you now that my review is probably rubbish. Sorry. The hype ain't no joke. This book deserves all the praise it's gotten and I'm so happy that I finally caved and read my first Taylor Jenkins Reid book.This story is about a rock band called The Six and their rise to fame during the 70s. Though the band has become a success on their own, when their manager decides to bring in Daisy Jones to work on a song with their lead singer Billy Dunne, it's apparent that Daisy is what's missing from the band. And so Daisy Jones and the Six is born. In the time of sex and drugs the band accounts their struggles and inner turmoil, unrequited love, and the drama behind the scenes. \nI guess I\u2019m saying\u2026if you redeem yourself, then believe in your own redemption.\nThough the book is primarily about Daisy and about Billy the other band members (and others) are just as present and they each have their own stories to tell. All of them had flaws and were by no means perfect but that's what made it seem so real. This book was definitely out of my comfort zone and it shocked me, when I got about 20% in, how invested I became in the story. I could not stop listening. This is one of my favourite books of 2019 and it's definitely one that I will pick up again. \n\u201cAnd no matter where we are, no matter what time of day it is, the world is dark and we are two blinking lights.

One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia\u2019s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety.

This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did. The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia's diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo's POV. I can't really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let's come back around to the fact that I've been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way before Gone Girl was written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such as The Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of \"includes what we need without being overly winded\". Unfortunately, I've seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years. I think I'm going to wrap it up here, and please don't let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley.", "\nAs you will see, it\u2019s an incredible story\u2014of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\nOhhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz: it is virtually unputdownable.I didn't actually have any plans to read The Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I'll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like \"nope\" and closed on their own.It's very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he's pretty \"fucked up\". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn't spoken a word since.\nBut let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.\nTheo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what's more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can't she say? What won't she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets. It's a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think \"just one more chapter\"). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there's enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway. Or it was for me at least. Full of thrills, artistic metaphor, twists and Greek tragedy.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "\nWow, I'm still reeling from that ending! A mindblowing, to-die for twist!\nA fast read that kept me intrigued from beginning to end, although the shocker came at the end. Wait......wait......what just happened? This was how I felt as a read the last few chapters!Alicia Berenson is such a mysterious, intriguing character and I was trying to figure her out the entire novel.\u00a0 I kept asking myself, \"What is up with Alicia?\"She is a famous, talented painter and happily married to her husband, Gabriel. They live in London and have a cozy life.Why would Alicia murder him and then never speak again? You want to know, right? Well, I did and couldn't stop reading until I found out. It is the feeling you have when you\u00a0\njust have to know why!!\nThe novel is narrated by Alicia's psychotherapist Theo Faber,\u00a0 He is determined to \"\nfix Alicia\n\".\u00a0 I was so invested in learning what the circumstances of Alicia's silence was and had to find out if Theo could save her.\u00a0 Would she ever speak again?\u00a0\u00a0READ IT NOW to find out!I wasn't going to read this one, and then requested it on NG and I'm really glad I did.\u00a0 As you can tell, I really enjoyed it!

Book is out in Feb 2019 Review posted to blog.", "\n(2.5) This was a solid.... meh for me.I was excited to pick up this psychological thriller because it has been getting some hype but it was a disappointment. Didn't care much for the characters, the twist was so obvious, the writing just okay. The only redeeming quality was the audiobook which made it possible for me to finish this book.Unless you never read thrillers I don't think it's worth it.\n", "\nI'm annoyed.\n", "She tied her husband to a chair.She shot him multiple times.She slit her own wrists.She waited for the police to arrive.At least, that's what THEY say she did. Alicia Berenson \nisn't SAYING anything.\nWhen Theo Faber, criminal psychotherapist, takes a new job at The Grove, he is well aware of their most famous patient, Alicia Berenson. The woman caught red-handed after killing her husband and who has remained silent since.In fact, Theo's goal is to work with her, to see if he can get her to reveal what really happened on the night her husband was killed. He's not sure he believes the official story.Through Theo's perspective, his investigation, and Alicia's own diary entries, the reader is brought along on a hair-raising mystery that is not for the faint of heart.Guys, I absolutely loved this book. This is the type of thriller that I really enjoy sinking my teeth into. The use of the diary entries, paired with Theo's investigations, made for a perfectly paced reveal!Michaelides is definitely an author to watch. I, for one, cannot wait to see what he comes up with next. Highly recommend!", "My thanks to Ben Willis at Orion Publishing Group for sending me a paperback copy of \u2018The Silent Patient\u2019 I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange*Alicia Berenson was discovered standing over her husband - he\u2019d been tied to a chair and shot in the face five times. Alicia gives no explanation and refuses to speak. She\u2019s admitted to a psychiatric unit, \u2018The Grove\u2019 in North London, and six years later she still hasn\u2019t spoken - not one single word! Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has always been obsessed with Alicia\u2019s story, and when a position presents itself at The Grove for someone with his qualifications, he applies for the job and is successful. Theo is certain that he can get her to talk, even though others have tried and failed. Although Alicia is silent, the narrative speaks to us in a way that she can\u2019t or won\u2019t, throwing the spotlight on the minutiae of her life as a talented artist, and ultimately what led to the events of that fateful night. Theo\u2019s own personal life is laid bare too, and he\u2019s also a very complex character - indeed not unlike Alicia. If Theo\u2019s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear? Because beneath Alicia\u2019s silent exterior, she has plenty to say!Clever, and compelling, with a humdinger of a twist- I hope the \u2018Silent\u2019 Patient \u2018speaks\u2019 to you too!", "Dear Alex Michaelides,Brav-the-fuck-o dude \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\"Her silence was like a mirror - reflecting yourself back at you.And it was often an ugly sight.\"And that, my friends, sums up this book perfectly.Dark psychological suspense is my favorite genre and books like this one are exactly the reason why. This book is the very definition of a page-turner. From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion. I never once felt like I had a grasp on how this story was going to play out, which kept me rapt until the last page.The blurb on the back cover says that the book has already been optioned for a movie and I'd like to put forth my recommendations for casting:Haley Bennett as AliciaandOliver Jackson Cohen as Theo (I expect a casting credit)I received an ARC copy of this book from the publisher. All opinions are my own.", "The beginning hooked me in because I was intrigued to learn more about Alicia's story, how her husband was murdered, and why she chose to remain silent. However, the book ended up bordering as a cheesy murder mystery, with the main character acting like a white-knight detective who would question a bunch of cartoonish side characters that just outright admit their motivations or feelings about Alicia. The twist was interesting, but a bit shaky - I think it could have been built up in a more believable way.", "5 shining stars! We finally have a winner. It\u2019s really page-turner, meticulously developed, smartly written book. I liked the final twist and ending of the book. Did my spider sense catch it? In the middle I was suspicious something was wrong but it well played and fooled me once! Shame on me!This is a successful debut novel with different writing technique. It may be sensed that the writer also works for big screen. Fast moving pace, twisty, edgy tricks, reminded me of \u201cGothika\u201d, \u201cAHS-Asylum\u201dmovies landed on Hitchcockian suspicious, dubious atmosphere! Mind games confuse the hell of you and surprises punching your face! There is a character is quite deserved my biggest slap!!! But if I speak about the identity of character, it means I have to give spoiler about murderer\u2019s identity! Great dilemma between revealing unlikable character and getting expelled from GR community because of my big mouth! So mouth zipped. Punches secretly clenched. Just read it and get some pain killers for over usage of your brain cells\ud83d\ude0a", "***NOW AVAILABLE***Well looks like I\u2019m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I\u2019ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the \u201cthrill\u201d, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel. I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I\u2019ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn\u2019t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn\u2019t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia\u2019s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn\u2019t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary. The book takes place in \u201cThe Grove\u201d a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia\u2019s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly \u201cbusy\u201d and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo\u2019s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia. SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of \u201cwhy\u201d, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn\u2019t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. The twist is a good one but doesn\u2019t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I\u2019m sure it will come as a surprise to many. I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed \u201cthe debut novel of the year for 2019\u201d as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states \"As you will see, it's an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.", "4.4/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u201c...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.\u201dHOLY SHIT! Wasn't this a mothefucking page turner? Like I literally read and listened to this in 2 home sittings, and 2 subway sittings. Holy motherfuck! I knew this Greek author could do it! #proudtobegreek. Honestly, all the Greek mentions in this book were porn to me. He wove a whole story so beautifully based on a Greek tragedy, it's wonderful. Anyone who is Greek in here, read this book. Love me some nice representation!This book was split into two sections: 1: Theo's point of view2: Alicia's point of viewTheo's point of view is split into two categories... him talking about himself and his wife and him talking about Alicia and himselfAlicia's point of view is seen through her diaryI found myself not as interested in Theo's chapters about his wife as I was in the entirety of the book. I knew it is the kind of story where this part would actually mean something to the main plot and not just to show us aspects about Theo's life and his personality, but they were the least interesting chapters for me nonetheless. Apart from that, the book itself was extremely fast paced, deep and exhilarating. I just couldn't for the life of me, stop turning the pages. You all know your girl lost sleep for this. Yes, I motherfucking did.Was the twist good and unexpected? Yes. Did you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to make it work in your head? Yes. Was it amazing nonetheless? Yes. Listen, it was a really great twist but if Theo had told us from the beginning, it would lose the momentum. So it's a twist based on a character not telling us something he already knew. I find that a tiny bit weak. But it worked with the story and I fucking loved it ok? Overall, I loved this book so much. In this review I talked about the two reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up. K bye now!", "The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication. When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn\u2019t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia\u2019s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let\u2019s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery. Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn\u2019t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.  However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.  It is easy to step into Theo\u2019s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia\u2019s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia\u2019s fragile psyche. But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It\u2019s a mind game from start to finish. Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn\u2019t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author\u2019s experience or the situation- in my opinion. In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I\u2019ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT\u2019S what I\u2019m talking about!! Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake. The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory. ", "FIVE STARSTHE SILENT PATIENT is a deep, dark tale of murder, love and revenge. This is a contemporary story steeped in a deliciously gothic tone. At the beginning of the book, we have a vicious murder, a frightening asylum setting for the criminally insane, and a suspect who refuses to speak. When Theo steps in to save the day as psychotherapist to the silent Alice, well\u2026.you are in for a twisted treat, so I can\u2019t divulge anymore!I went into this book with expectations it would be similar to Alice Feeney\u2019s Sometimes I Lie or one of my old favorites Before I Go to Sleep. I was wrong, it is so much better! The main characters of Theo and Alice are richly layered with just enough reveals leaked out over time that you will constantly wonder \u201cwho is the unreliable narrator here?\u201d (You will doubt yourself over and over and I LOVE THAT!!!). Truly, one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year! I absolutely devoured it. Theo takes you into his head, explaining the psychology involved in certain situations, as if the reader is part conspirator, part solution. There are Freudian quotes sprinkled liberally throughout this mystery--pure delight for armchair psychologists!I listened to the Audible version--Outstanding!", "5 \u201cthis lived up to the hype\u201d stars!!! Brilliant! Shocking! Addictive! Mesmerizing! I\u2019m stunned that this is a debut novel. The skillfully scripted storyline, the truly unforgettable characters, the pulse-pounding suspense, the consistently enthralling pace, the enticing narration \u2013 all exceptionally fantastic! This was dazzling perfection! The author, Alex Michaelides, has set the bar extremely high for any follow up novels. Wow! I\u2019m going to keep this short and sweet and avoid getting into any storyline details. Bottom line, if you enjoy psychological thrillers, you MUST get your hands on a copy of this. This has easily earned a spot on my 2019 Favourites list! I am eagerly awaiting his next novel!This was a Traveling Sister read that we all loved. Thank you to my lovely local library for lending me a copy of this fantastic book!", "5, the debut of the century stars!!!Full review along with a Curry Chicken recipe featured on my blog Recipe & a Read!So first off, can I get a \u201chell yeah\u201d for Alex Michaelides for this stunning debut of a novel! I ordered this on a whim on Amazon because I didn\u2019t want to wait through the 86 holds at my library and when it came in the mail I decided just to take one little peak. However, what actually happened, was me zooming through this thrill ride at break-neck speed and finishing it in less than 12 hours (I had to sleep ok). So needless to say, I quite loved this book.Alicia Berenson was thirty-three years old when she killed her husband.Alicia and her husband Gabriel are the *perfect* couple. Alicia is an up and coming painter and Gabriel is a noted fashion photographer. They\u2019re young, they\u2019re beautiful and they\u2019re head over heels in love with one another. However, as with all thrillers that quickly comes crumbling to the ground when Alicia is found standing over her dead husbands body \u2013 after being shot in the face six times \u2013 and covered in both of their blood.As everyone around Alicia grapples with this terrifying series of events and struggle to come up with a defense not just to save Alicia\u2019s life but to understand how this could\u2019ve happened their met with a brick wall. Only, that brick wall is Alicia and she\u2019s refusing to say a word. Alicia sits idly by in the court room as she is vilified and damned for killing the only man she\u2019s ever truly loved and still, she says nothing. As she\u2019s saved from the death penalty and instead put in a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, still she doesn\u2019t say a word. Years and years go by, and still Alicia doesn\u2019t say a word.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this before. Haven\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cAbout fireworks?\u201d\u201cAbout love. About how we often mistake love for fireworks \u2013 for drama and dysfunction. But, real love is very quiet, very still. It\u2019s boring, if seen from a perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm \u2013 and constant.\u201d *can I get an AMEN*Theo Farber is a criminal psychotherapist and he\u2019s been following Alicia\u2019s story since the beginning. Coming from a painful upbringing and life himself, Theo see\u2019s parts of him in Alicia and he believes, no he knows that he can help Alicia heal. As he carefully but steadily dismantles his promising career and life in order to get a job at The Grove, where Alicia is being housed he moves his pieces about the chess board of life and gets closer and closer to Alicia hoping to uncover her story and get her to tell what happened between her and Gabriel once and for all.As it turns out, Alicia feels a draw to Theo as well. At a slow, but not tedious and incredibly suspenseful pace, Alicia begins to open up and little bits and pieces of her story are falling out left for the reader and Theo to put together. What follows is easily one of the most suspenseful, exciting, thrilling and surprising stories I\u2019ve read in quite a long time.At the time I didn\u2019t understand. But that\u2019s how therapy works. A patient delegates his unacceptable feelings to his therapist; and she holds everything he is afraid to feel, and she feels it for him. Then, ever so slowly, she feeds his feelings back to him. So first things first, as someone who has an undergraduate degree in Psychology (which means next to nothing in the field) but who has also been a major advocate and participant in therapy I loved the way it was portrayed in this book. Something that irks me to no end, is the way the entertainment industry portrays not just people who attend therapy but therapists themselves. The whole \u201cand how does that make you feel\u201d line really annoys the crap out of me because that\u2019s not what therapy is about. I think Michaelide\u2019s honored the profession and despite being a pretty intense thriller and how easily it could\u2019ve been done, therapy was never vilified but admired.So onto the meat of this story \u2013 what initially drew me in was the synopsis of Alicia killing her husband and then never speaking another word. I can\u2019t quite explain why exactly that particular linchpin got me hook, line and sinker but it did. However, what gripped and held me and didn\u2019t let me go from the moment I started it was an incredibly well paced story. Michaelides delivered a stunning and gripping plot, but what made it shine is that every piece of information the reader is given is given to you only exactly when it is needed to move the story forward. Nothing is sensationalized or used to provide cheap jump scare thrills. There\u2019s a sinister undertone throughout the book and to me, The Silent Patient is the prime-o example of what the genre of psychological thriller is supposed to be.Her silence was like a mirror \u2013 reflecting yourself back at you.And it was often an ugly sight.I don\u2019t want to give to much away because again, this is one of the most surprised I\u2019ve been in a long time by the final twists in a thriller book. I\u2019ve been interested in reading this for quite some time, and I\u2019m so happy I picked it up sooner rather than later. I guarantee this is going to be one of the top books of 2019 and if it\u2019s on your list \u2013 pick it up, if it\u2019s not \u2013 add it now. The prose, the pacing, the suspense and development into the story were all a complete slam dunk for me. This is absolutely the type of book that once you pick it up, you\u2019re not going to be able to put it down until you\u2019re done with it and know how it ends \u2013 and the ending, is quite the doozie. I\u2019m thrilled by Alex Michaelides and really excited to see future works because this author knows how to get it done my dudes.", "Teetering between a 4 and a 4.5Alicia Berenson is a famous painter who has been admitted to the Grove, a forensic unit in North London. She has been charged with murdering her husband, Graham, who is a fashion photographer, after he returns home late one evening. After shooting Graham, Alicia has never spoken again.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who accepted a job at the Grove in the hopes of working with Alicia. He is obsessed with learning her motive. He knows he can get her to talk. Others have tried - others have failed. Will he be successful?Although Alicia does not speak, the reader gets a glimpse into her life through Theo's discussions with those in her life. Well, more to the point, we get their impressions of her, things they know about her and their own assumptions about her. They seem to have no problem sharing what they know about her but why hasn't anyone been to visit her? The reader gets to learn even more about Alicia through her diary entries. Finally, Alicia \"speaks\" via the written word. But what could have led her to shoot her husband? Will she ever speak? Why isn't she speaking now? Is it by choice? Is it due to trauma? hmmmm Theo is also an interesting character. Most of the novel is told through him. The reader also gets a glimpse into his life, his thoughts and the inner workings of his mind. I was curious as to why he was so obsessed with learning her motive. Why is he so driven to learn the truth? Is he a fan or her artwork? Will learning the truth advance his career? This is a very clever tale which grabbed my attention right away. I was intrigued to learn what was going on. I had several theories and assumptions. Some were close and some were way off base - as in a mile off base. Of course, there is that shocking reveal - I did not see that coming - AT ALL. It really was the perfect \"OMG, what did I just read?\" moment followed by an \"Aha!\" moment. This book was a page turner for me. I kept turning the pages to learn how the book was going to unfold. The ending felt a little bit rushed and I wanted to just a tad bit more. Overall, a very enjoyable read even thought one character really annoyed me. Thank you to Celadon Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my own.", "I\u2019m giving this novel all the stars! What a freaking ending!!! I absolutely loved it!I listened to the audio. Both narrators were brilliant! The audio might have actually enhanced this novel! The narration was that good! Would make a good first listen. Both narrators made it very easy to follow.Highly recommended!", " \u201cThere\u2019s so much pain everywhere, and we just close our eyes to it. The truth is we\u2019re all scared. We\u2019re terrified of each other. I\u2019m terrified of myself.\u201d  This was a wild ride!I\u2019d been looking forward to this thriller for absolutely ages \u2013 and it was definitely worth the wait in my opinion.Theo is a psychotherapist, recently moved to a new institution as he is fascinated by the woman referred to as The Silent Patient.Alicia shot her husband in the face five times, then proceeded to try and take her own life. Since being convicted she hasn\u2019t uttered a single word, and she has been committed.Theo takes it upon himself to get Alicia to talk; to find out why she did what she did. What was going through her mind at the time?I was gripped \u2013 there are so many unlikable characters, it is hard to trust anyone. We also have chapters regarding Theo\u2019s home life, his traumatising childhood \u2013 which led him to work in mental health, and also his relationship with his wife Kathy. \u201cWe often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It\u2019s boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.\u201d I enjoyed the ending \u2013 I didn\u2019t see that coming and it felt believable yet surprising. Although after I spoke through it with my mum I did realise that it is slightly far-fetched \u2013 but hey, I still found it entertaining which is the main point. (view spoiler)[ So it turns out Theo\u2019s wife Kathy was cheating on him with Alicia\u2019s husband Gabriel \u2013 what a small world eh? And Theo follows Gabriel home, ties up both him and Alicia and tells Gabriel he will either kill him or kill Alicia \u2013 he can choose. Gabriel chooses to save himself. Theo shoots the ceiling then leaves and Alicia shoots Gabriel in the face. That was all understandable, Alicia is very unstable at this time. What I found less understandable is when Theo begins working at the institution and meets Alicia for the second time. She recognises him (though we don\u2019t know this until the end), and Theo decides that to protect himself Alicia needs to die. So he injects her with a lethal amount of morphine. I don\u2019t get this though\u2026 why kill her? She wasn\u2019t speaking anyway until Theo starting having sessions with her \u2013 he could have avoided it all\u2026.to me it just seemed all rather odd.

Loved....loved....loved! This book is exactly what I needed\u2026...a fast-paced and fully absorbing thriller that I literally could not put down or stop thinking about. This was some fantastic storytelling!THE SILENT PATIENT by ALEX MICHAELIDES is a dazzling, fascinating, compelling, and an absolutely fabulous psychological thriller novel that was quite the immersive and thrilling book to read. Right from the very beginning I knew that this book was going to be a gripping page-turner for me and I\u2019m happy to say that it totally held my attention right to the very end, making this quite the compulsive and all-consuming read. ALEX MICHAELIDES delivers an impressive, clever, suspenseful, entertaining and well-written read here with an intriguing and refreshing premise, an intoxicating mystery and irresistible compelling characters. I thought this was an extremely well-crafted thriller where the author seductively guides you to the shocking and twisty conclusion. This book definitely appealed to this psychological thriller lover even though I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say there is anything new here and you might have your suspicions early on like I did but it was all in the execution here that made this quite the fantastic and exhilarating read. I thought it was so cleverly and originally done. If an author can still make that ending shocking and thrilling to read even if you think you\u2019ve figured out the outcome well then I\u2019d say that is one heck of an accomplishment and perfect read!

Would recommend!Thank you so much to NetGalley, Celadon Books and Alex Michaelides for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of this book in exchange for a review!Review can also be found on our blog:https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/2...", "A lot to love about this tightly-woven, twist-filled, expertly-structured psychological suspense. It comes in strong and plays all the hits: mysterious clues in paintings, creepy settings, diary entries, suspicious characters, and plenty of jaw-dropping surprises. If you're looking for a mystery that checks all the boxes, here it is. The only thing that's missing is a blackout drunk female narrator--but don't worry, there's a heavily-medicated, silent female to fill that void.Some of the sweeping praise might be excessive. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's brilliant and the plot generally walks along well-trodden ground. That said, I do think the structure is masterfully crafted and goes above and beyond what mystery readers have come to expect. Pacing and sense of time could not have been done better, and I particularly appreciate that it doesn't drag. Most mysteries, I feel, are twice the length with half the intrigue.Michaelides said in an interview that his goal was to write a suspenseful beach read, a la Agatha Christie. With that goal in mind, I would say The Silent Patient is a tremendous success.", "Once I picked this book up, I couldn\u2019t stop and finished it in two sittings. I was intrigued right from the start and found it to be quite the page-turner.\u00a0Theo is a psychotherapist who has issues of his own (don\u2019t they all?) but he finagles his way into a job at a psychiatric facility so he can work with Alicia, a patient who was found guilty some years earlier of killing her husband, Gabriel, by\u00a0shooting him in the face 5 times.\u00a0\u00a0She has not spoken a word in the years since the murder and Theo is convinced he can help her.\u00a0I\u2019m not going to go into details of the plot as it\u2019s best discovered by the reader. But, what follows is a twisty tale that took me by surprise.\u00a0Sometimes an ending or twist\u00a0comes out of nowhere, without warning. But, the author gave us all the clues, I had just failed to put them all together. And that is my favorite kind of mystery book. There were no rabbits pulled from a hat and no twists just for the sake of shocking the reader. In the end, I\u00a0found myself smiling\u00a0and thinking \"well-done\".\u00a0\u2028Is it perfect? No. Are there a few plot holes? Yes. Did I have to suspend some disbelief? Yes. Did the author tend to over explain things at times when we can figure it out on our own? Yes. Did I care? No. For a fun quick and addictive read, this fit the bill quite nicely.\u00a0This is a fantastic debut and I can\u2019t wait to see how he develops as an author. I\u2019ll be sure to read his next book.\u00a0This book will make a terrific movie if Hollywood does it right.\u00a0\u00a0This was another great buddy read with my friend Marialyce!", "Update: The Best 2019 Mystery is here!! yeah! yeah! yeah! There is reason to CELEBRATE!!.........................................................What???!!! Is this serious??!! I am shocked by how good this book is!! Gripping from start to finish! It blew my mind! I would never have guessed the ending!! WOW!! Loved the idea of alternating the patient\u00b4s life with the therapist\u00b4s life to converge on a major twist! I will be looking forward to reading more books by the author in the future! Highly recommended!so, Alicia Berenson\u2019s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London\u2019s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia\u2019s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations\u2014a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....", "As a psychotherapist, Theo Faber thought it was obvious that Alicia Berenson had suffered a severe trauma surrounding her husband, Gabriel\u2019s death. \u201cAlicia joined the ranks of other briefly famous murders; faces we remember, but whose names we forget\u201d. NOT Theo Faber!! He \u2018never\u2019 forgot - even though nearly six years have gone by.Alicia was admitted to a mental institution- rather than prison - even though all evidence pointed to her killing her husband. Characters were under-developed and flat.At the beginning of the story, we learn Theo was drawn to psychology to heal himself. We shall see! Theo is also \u2018very\u2019 interested in working with Alicia....( of course)...which he does. Alicia has been silent since the night of her husband\u2019s murder. Want to know why Alicia never talked? Why she stayed completely speechless for six years? It\u2019s not all that interesting - honest! Needed much more pulp to make her story juicy! I thought this entire novel was silly - Rather than nitpick the flaws - and let my critical mind blabber on- Mostly...this novel was lacking in *joy*.It wasn\u2019t satire...simply doltish!!!I didn\u2019t know how the book was \u2018exactly\u2019 going to end - but it was clear for me early on who the real troubled silent patient was. Very quick read! 2.5 stars - rating up - being a debut that has somehow managed to draw major buzz royalty! Kudos to Alex Michaelides... good karmadebut-hit!", "This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big \u2018twist\u2019 that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn\u2019t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, \u2018investigate\u2019 Alicia\u2019s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author\u2019s single quest to deliver the big \u2018twist\u2019 he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo\u2019s belongings are searched by \u2018security\u2019 before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can\u2019t have any lighters for \u201cobvious reasons\u201d - can\u2019t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn\u2019t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia\u2019s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife\u2019s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia\u2019s husband\u2019s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo\u2019s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn\u2019t she, I don\u2019t know, go get help because you\u2019ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It\u2019s almost funny.And what about Alicia\u2019s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn\u2019t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She\u2019s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with \u201chorse dosage\u201d amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she\u2019s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you\u2019re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I\u2019m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this \u2018twist\u2019 has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.", "4.5 stars.I read a lot of thrillers, so I tend to be pretty hard on them. Because, as I've mentioned, I have this tendency to suspect every single character that appears in a thriller, I'm often not as surprised as many others are when authors throw in twists and turns, or when the perpetrator is finally revealed.While I had some suspicions about the way things in Alex Michaelides' terrific debut, \nThe Silent Patient\n, might go, I will admit he pulled one over on me at one point. I really enjoyed the way he kept me guessing and was completely hooked on this story of murder, infidelity, psychological instability, and the desire to be a savior.Alicia Berenson was an artist of some renown, but these days she's more infamous than anything else. Married to a handsome photographer for whom she is consumed by love, they seem to be the picture-perfect couple, at least to anyone on the outside looking in. One night, her husband came home late from a shoot. Moments later, he was shot five times in the face and killed, and the police found Alicia covered in his blood, as well as her own, as she attempted to slit her own wrists.From that moment on, Alicia hasn't spoken a word. Her trial for her husband's murder was a hotbed of rumors, innuendo, and media sensationalism, but no one ever finds the answers they seek, no one understands what would have made Alicia kill her husband so brutally and then try to take her own life. With no other real choice, the judge sentences her to treatment at the Grove, a forensic unit for dangerous patients, in North London.\"And so, with no further revelation forthcoming, the disappointed media eventually lost interest in Alicia Berenson. She joined the ranks of other briefly famous murderers; faces we remember, but whose names we forget.\"But psychotherapist Theo Faber continues to be fascinated by Alicia's case, and he believes that only he can reach her, can delve down into her psyche to uncover the secrets that have kept her silent for six years now. When a position opens at the Grove, he is quick to jump on it, and it isn't long before he has convinced the clinical director, Dr. Lazarus Diomedes, to let him begin treating Alicia, even if she hasn't spoken a word to any other doctor, and has displayed sometimes self-harming and sometimes violent behavior toward others.Theo does want to help Alicia and perhaps find out the truth behind her husband's murder and the events of that fateful night. But he's also drawn to her because he believes they share a troubled childhood and even a history of emotional challenges. Theo has struggled with depression throughout his life, yet he believes he's uniquely qualified to help Alicia, and perhaps, himself.\"The real motivation was purely selfish. I was on a quest to help myself. I believe the same is true for most people who go into mental health. We are drawn to this profession because we are damaged\u2014we study psychology to heal ourselves. Whether we are prepared to admit this or not is another question.\"As Theo attempts to connect with Alicia, he faces challenges from his colleagues and the management of the Grove, who are considering closing down the aging facility, and from Alicia herself. Is she really mad, or is the silence an act? Is she a violent murderer or a misunderstood, grieving widow? Theo seeks answers as his own life seems to be imploding at the same time.The book's narration shifts between past and present, from Theo's endeavors to treat Alicia to Alicia's reflections of the past expressed through her personal journal. I really wasn't sure what to believe about her, and I kept waiting for some surprise to come bursting out of the woodwork. Michaelides does an excellent job teasing out the suspense in small doses, making you suspect different characters along the way, while you race to figure out the truth as Theo tries to do the same.In a sea full of thrillers, I found \nThe Silent Patient\n to be a really strong one that stands apart. There were a lot of layers to this book, and Michaelides was like an orchestra conductor, making sure all of the pieces worked together. If this was his debut, there's no telling what he will come up with next. I know I'll be watching.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com.Check out my list of the best books I read in 2018 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2018.html.

Congratulations Alex Michealides!A woman, successful in every way, returns home one night and shoots her husband five times in the face.Or did she? We begin her road to recovery. She will not or cannot speak. I do want several hours guessing whom was responsible. I never put this book down. Yes. Best thriller of 2019. A constant game of guessing. When, why and what.The take told by her therapist. An amazing doctor who has only her good in mind and sets out to find why she won't speak.Why can't or won't she speak? I can never tell. This is a book which must be read. Highly recommended.A MUST READ!Don't miss this outrageous thriller. It is the best for a reason. You will suspect everyone. But never will you imagine!", "Whoa! This was brilliant! This book right here is the reason that I love psychological thrillers. This has become an overly saturated genre with every one taking a stab at writing these twisty little mind fucks but more often than not they fall flat. It takes a talented mind and writer to pull off a really shocking twist successfully. Alex Michaelides has done just that because I did not see that coming at all and for that I thank you! *claps hands* Alicia Berenson appears to have it all. She's a successful painter and her husband, Gabriel, is a famous fashion photographer. What would drive this seemingly happy woman to shoot her husband five times in the face only to never speak again? Psychotherapist, Theo Faber, is desperate to work with Alicia to see if he can breakthrough her silence to finally find out the truth. That's it. That's all you get. I don't want anyone to be spoiled. I suggest not reading too many reviews as it is inevitable that some jerk will spill the beans. Don't be that jerk! If this is any inclination as to the type of reading year 2019 is going to be then HURRAH! Dare I say that this has made it to my \"favorites\" shelf. Highest recommendation! All the twisted stars!

Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond\u2019s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship\u2014and even love\u2014after all.Smart, warm, uplifting, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .  the only way to survive is to open your heart.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564647507l/31434883.jpg", "title": "Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine", "authors": "Gail Honeyman", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine", "reviews": ["My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...ALL THE STARS !!!I won an advanced copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway. Thank you!To be honest, I'm not sure if this book would have been on my radar if I hadn't won it. Although the great reviews may have pulled me in. At any rate, I am so happy I read it.I LOVED THIS BOOK !!Just like it says in the title of the book, Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine....well she thinks she is. She is honestly not worried that she may be missing out on anything. She is content with her life.Eleanor is a little bit....odd. She's very intelligent and well-spoken with impeccable grammar (thanks to Mummy) but she lacks the ability to filter what she says and therefore she will tell you exactly what she's thinking. This can lead to very awkward situations.Eleanor is comfortable with her routines. She's worked at the same job for nine years. She starts work at 8:30, at lunch she buys a newspaper which she reads from cover to cover and then does the crossword. She finishes out her day, leaving work at 5:30. Eleanor listens to the Archers as she makes a simple dinner (usually pasta and salad - one pan one plate), watches TV or reads for a little while then off to bed at ten. Her weekday routine only changes on Wednesday when she talks with \"Mummy\" for ten minutes. Weekends are a bit different. After work Friday she picks up pizza, wine and two big bottles of Vodka for the weekend. She drinks the vodka over the weekend.....in a state where she's neither drunk nor sober, waiting for Monday to come. No one comes over and she doesn't go anywhere to visit. She sometimes wonders if she's a figment of her own imagination.But she's fine with it. She's fine. There's nothing missing, she doesn't need anyone else. Well that was what she told herself. But then it happens...\n\"He was light and heat. He blazed. Everything he came into contact with would be changed. I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I found him\"\nNow Eleanor is on a mission. First she decides a make-over is in order....and where she starts is both shocking and hilarious. I really want to write about what happened but I think I would spoil a very funny moment for many readers.Things don't go exactly as planned.When her computer at work stops working she meets Raymond from IT. An easy-going guy, Raymond is intrigued by Eleanor, but she's just not interested. She's busy trying to re-create herself for the man of her dreams. But after work one day Eleanor and Raymond come across a man who has fallen on the sidewalk. Together they help the man, Sammy and so begins a friendship along with the start of many changes in Eleanor's life.The story is told from Eleanor's point of view. We go along for the ride as she navigates her way through her life, learning to stand up for herself. But it won't be easy. Secrets and memories that have been tucked away for many years can be painful to remember.When you have trouble with social skills I can see how it would be easier to refrain from situations where things could go wrong so fast..... It would be easier being alone. As I mentioned there are many funny moments throughout the book. I really like how the author wrote these parts. I never felt like I was laughing AT Eleanor but at the things she said or the situations she ended up in. However, there are also many sad and painful moments. Times where I felt terrible for Eleanor.Some of the funniest parts came out of nowhere - the phone doesn't ring often but if telemarketers call Eleanor whispers \"I know where you live\" and hangs up. Often it was what she would be saying to herself that was funny.An incredible read that had me bouncing from one emotion to the next. The author did a tremendous job bringing these wonderfully unique characters to life.It's hard to believe this is the author's debut novel.There are so many words that can be used to describe this novel - hilarious , unique, heartwarming, heartbreaking, charming, hopeful, inspiring, and COMPLETELY unforgettable.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!", "5 Stars.\u201cEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine\u201d but after finishing this novel, I am not.  I was completely unprepared for the life of Eleanor Oliphant and that of her \u2018Mummy.\u201d To be frank, I was ill-equipped to deal with it, much like Eleanor. And it wrecked me. At thirty years-old, Eleanor Oliphant is alone in this world. She always has been, actually. In and out of foster care since she was a little girl, she has never been touched by anyone in a loving way and doesn\u2019t even know what that would feel like, but that\u2019s ok. All of her physical needs are met, you see and she has never had any emotional needs. Seeing as she doesn\u2019t have any friends, Eleanor is quiet and socially awkward. Everyone thinks she is fairly strange, if you must to know. Not that she minds since people\u2019s behavior makes absolutely no sense to her. She is good at being alone and she does not feel sorry for herself. Not even when \u2018Mummy\u2019 calls and viciously tells her daughter off and berates her for being being \u201cnaughty.\u201d Eleanor, however wears a coat of armor and does her best to let her mother\u2019s words bounce off of her. Eleanor has no aspirations though she has done accounting at an office for the last 9 years. Every day of her life is the same and she would be nothing without routine. One night, all of that changes rather abruptly. After work, she and a coworker named Raymond whom she just met and who happens to be leaving the office at the same time as her, find themselves in the exact right place at the right time. Both Eleanor and Raymond see a man (named Samuel), go down on the sidewalk and they go have a look see and discover that he needs an ambulance. This incident ends up tying the three together and becomes one of the most significant in Eleanor Oliphant\u2019s life. It forges a bond of friendship between them, which is something Eleanor has never experienced before in all her thirty years. During this time, Eleanor also ends up finding him. The man she has been waiting for all of her life. The man she is meant to be with. Now she just has to get him to notice her. In trying to do so, Eleanor grows bolder and more confident. She also learns to lean on and open herself up to her new friends.Throughout the book, Eleanor slowly experiences a metamorphosis, one that often makes you smile, laugh and of course, cry. She is damaged and quirky but oh so special. I loved her dearly. For more reasons than one. I identified with Eleanor Oliphant you see, and for that, I was unprepared. I did say that this book wrecked me right?! I get why Eleanor is Completely Fine. She had no choice. Unfortunately, Eleanor\u2019s \u2018Mummy\u2019 is someone I recognized fairly well. When I heard her voice (in a Scottish accent) on the audiobook, and the way she spoke to her daughter, my chest got tight and my throat closed up and I sobbed. Unlike Eleanor's \u201cMummy\u201d however, mine happens to be British instead of Scottish - though the accents are close, thus I therefore guess that listening to the audiobook had an even more profound effect on me. I\u2019ve had similar conversations, in case it wasn\u2019t obvious and I felt Eleanor\u2019s pain more deeply as it related to her \u2018Mummy\u2019, for at certain times in my life, it mirrored my own. All that aside however, Eleanor does not go quietly into the dark goodnight (and neither did I, for what it\u2019s worth). Though it affected me greatly, \u201cEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine\u201d is without a doubt one of the most incredible, profound, and beautifully well written novels I have absorbed in ages. It wrecked me in the best and worst ways possible. In case it\u2019s not obvious, it will stay with me for a long time. I think I came across it on purpose as both Eleanor Oliphant and I needed something from it and I think we were both lucky enough to receive it.  Published on Goodreads and Amazon on 6.26.17.", "Eleanor Oliphant is completely 100% fine. She goes to her office job five days a week and then treats herself to a frozen pizza and a bottle of vodka on a weekend. She lives alone and doesn't have any friends, but that's okay. She's doing real well, thank you very much. Except maybe she isn't. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine caught me completely unawares. I'll be honest - I picked it up because it got some buzz and the author is British, but it actually turned out to be one of those perfectly-balanced sad/funny books. Maybe like some combination of The Rosie Project, Me Before You, Finding Audrey and A Man Called Ove. It takes a serious, traumatic issue and weaves it into a warm, funny and, yes, sometimes sad tale.I read a lot of books and many characters come and go. Some are well-developed and interesting, others less so. But on a rare occasion I find one of those truly memorable characters that will stay with me a long time. Eleanor is one of them. She is socially clueless in a way that puts my teen self to shame. She is literal to a degree that everyone finds odd. It's painful to witness and yet so, so endearing.I think I like this book so much because it is actually really sad, but never manipulative. On a surface level, it's a very funny novel about a socially-inept twenty-nine year-old woman. Her attempts to become \"normal\" and integrate into society by having manicures and waxes are sources of hilarity. But it is very sad. It's sad when we see her coworkers talking about her, but Eleanor is oblivious to their scorn. It's sad how alone in life she is. It's sad when she \"falls in love\" with an idea of a person.It's not a romantic book and I'm glad. There are hints that the central relationship will eventually develop into romance, but this is really a book about Eleanor. I am thankful that the author didn't cure Eleanor and lead her out of the darkness by having her fall in love. Being happy and achieving greater self-worth should, in my opinion, never be linked to romance.I really enjoyed it. It's great to find a book so packed full of emotion without seeming overly-sentimental.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "No. No. No. No. No. No.All apologies to my lovely Goodreads friends who have liked (or loved) this book, but it's not for me. And it's sad. . . because I wanted it, I waited for it, and I was finally able to start it. It's Mother's Day, and my family handed me bath salts and my new book and told me to go for it. They know I'm just crazy enough to read an entire book in one bath, and I was ready to do it.And I prepared my bath, and I began reading, and I was (very quickly) almost in physical pain. I don't mean to be rude to the author; I know how hard it is to write a novel and get it published, but this would not have made it past my eyes, if she had handed it to me.Again, ALL APOLOGIES, but this is Mother's Day, and you have one annoyed mother on your hands. You have ruined my bath, and in doing so, you have released the Kraken!! MUST the reader be invited in to experience every one of Eleanor's bowel movements and meals? MUST we suffer through every not-interesting-in-the-least observation on life?And, how must we EVER believe that a woman this bizarre would be able to function in the world and/or experience a friendship or a romance? According to Eleanor, she has \"white contours of scar tissue that slither across my right cheek.\" Here's where I just about threw the book. Explain. No, seriously. Explain how scar tissue slithers across a face. Do you mean as you are speaking or making funny faces? Did you attend Hogwarts? Are you a Slytherin? Help, please!Also. . . somehow. . . Eleanor hangs up phones quietly. But, it's 2017, and we all just use that little button now. There's no loud, there's no quiet, there's just that one button. Explain.Oh, and when she hangs up the phone with her Mummy (choke and gag), \"It was only when the air went dead that I noticed I'd been crying.\"How does the air go dead? No, I'm not kidding. Please, explain what that sounds like, what it looks like. How does the air go dead?If you want to read about a WAY more adorable person with Asperger's. . . go find Don Tillman.

I wasn\u2019t made for illiteracy; it simply didn\u2019t come naturally.\nI adored Raymond's gentle prying and Eleanor's slow acceptance of other people.

What an incredible story! \u201cThese days, loneliness is the new cancer - a shameful, embarrassing thing, brought upon yourself in some obscure way. A fearful, incurable thing, so horrifying that you dare not mention it; other people don\u2019t want to hear the word spoken aloud for fear that they might too be afflicted.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s story hit me so much harder than I expected it to. She is thirty years old, has worked at the same job since she left university, speaks on the phone to mummy once a week and drinks two litres of vodka every weekend. Eleanor Oliphant is fine. One day, Eleanor and a colleague help assist an elderly man who\u2019d fallen over on the street. From there we follow Eleanor and Raymond\u2019s budding friendship, and we realise just how \u2018not fine\u2019 Eleanor truly is.  \u201cI\u2019d tried so hard, but something about me just didn\u2019t fit. There was, it seemed, no Eleanor-shaped social hole for me to slot into.\u201d Eleanor is painfully relatable, her awkwardness at social encounters, reliance on alcohol and the burying of all feelings and past grievances, is something I feel on a personal level. It\u2019s as if her story came to me at just the right time in my life. It was heartbreaking, honest and powerful.  \u201cI was thirty years old, I realised, and I had never walked hand in hand with anyone. No one had ever rubbed my tired shoulders, or stroked my face.\u201d All of us have felt alone at some point in our lives, Eleanor\u2019s story serves as a reminder that we are a lot more alike than we realise. A bit of kindness can go such a long way, friendship can truly be life saving.", "As you can deduce from the title, Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine. Or, so she thinks. But, by most people\u2019s standards, I\u2019d say not.When you first meet her, it\u2019s hard not to feel overwhelmingly sad for Eleanor. Maybe even to pity her a bit. Eleanor is simply existing in a lonely and somber life without friends or family. And let\u2019s be honest, at times her bluntness is sort of off-putting.Eleanor is just fine living by her own self-imposed routine. The hour-long lunch spent with the same sandwich and the daily crossword puzzle. The nightly pesto dinner recipe. The Friday treat of frozen pizza and wine. And the vodka, lots and lots of vodka\u2014her coping mechanism for the long and lonesome weekends.The epitome of socially awkward, Eleanor is oblivious to social cues and norms, uninhibited by a filter, quite literal, and extremely frugal. At thirty, she\u2019s set with her one and only job\u2014no ambition for anything better or more challenging on the horizon.Laying eyes on \u201chusband material\u201d sparks her desire for a metamorphosis of sorts. She figures landing her soulmate is going to require some work\u2014new hair, clothes and maybe even a little makeup to hide her facial scarring. After all, being with a musician requires a certain poise.\nThere are scars on my heart, just as thick, as disfiguring as those on my face. I know they're there. I hope some undamaged tissue remains, a patch through with love can come in and flow out. I hope.\nIt\u2019s actually a happenstance run-in with one of her coworkers and the ensuing friendship that inspires the most change in Eleanor\u2014her outlook on life and interactions with people. It\u2019s comical that Raymond doesn\u2019t seem fazed by Eleanor\u2019s stunted social skills. In fact, his mellow attitude and companionship go a long way to smooth her edges.When things don\u2019t go to plan, Eleanor is forced to stare down her truth. To succumb to the reality that everyone has problems and no feeling is insurmountable. That eventually with time\u2014not vodka\u2014things will get better. It's the why behind it all that broke my heart. Gail Honeyman balances the heavy\u2014and there\u2019s a lot here, so be prepared\u2014with humor and hope; taking readers on a journey right along with Eleanor. My own feelings skewing from odd to charmed. Quirky Eleanor managed to chip off a piece of my heart, stowing it away in her trusty shopper for safekeeping. With a pair of pom-poms in hand, I stood on the sidelines cheering Eleanor on as she discovered what life is truly about\u2014living. Connecting with others. Taking those much-needed pauses to drink in her surroundings. And the potential for more in each and every aspect of life. From broken soul to a woman on a mission to live life, Eleanor's is an inspiring story, one I know I\u2019m better for reading. And naturally, the part that squeezed the awww out of me\u2014the healing powers of Glen. =^..^=", "5 STARSThank you, Eleanor Oliphant. Thank you for picking me up out of my reading slump. Thank you for being so funny, so sad, so smart, so blunt. Thank you for being a literary character that will live forever in the hearts of (most) anyone that reads you. Oh, and a big thank you for enriching my own personal vocab. My Kindle dictionary has never had such a workout. What a nice perk!! Effortless writing that flows naturally fast, even though Eleanor O prefers to use crossword type clues as actual everyday language. She is a piece of work! And I adore her.I didn\u2019t want this book to end. No, seriously did not want it to end, so why did I devour it as fast as ice cream melting at a picnic? Because it is that good! My black, black heart doesn't always have to read about murders and mysteries. I love a feel good story as much as the next guy. I just need it to be the right kind of writing (GOOD, NOT cheesy). The right kind of character (layered, quirky, UNIQUE).  I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of A MAN CALLED OVE. Ove did not strike me as a real person. He felt artificial and a bit contrived. Made up. Eleanor O, on the other hand, is real.This is the right kind of everything. Thank you, Ms. Honeyman, for writing it. I actually feel sad for other books that try so hard to achieve the big feels and don't even come close to Eleanor Oliphant. I've meant to read this for at least a year now and finally was nudged into it by my bookclub IRL! If this is on your TBR and you haven't read it yet, ahhhhhhh, I envy you. Don't wait a minute longer. Do it now!", "Here is a novel at the exact room temperature everyone likes, not too cold, not to hot, just right, it\u2019s like Goldilocks finding the right bed, everybody jumps in and goes right off to sleep, no one has a bad word to say, the Guardian loved it, the Irish Times said it \u201chits the accessible literary sweet spot\u201d, Costa Book Prize, Reece Witherspoon to star in the movie, five stars rain down upon Eleanor Oliphant on Goodreads until she can no longer be seen, buried beneath tons of billowy love. If The Beatles could reform they would issue a single immediately called \u201cAll You Need is Eleanor Oliphant\u201d. Our story is a simple one. Eleanor is the poster girl for loneliness and social isolation caused by having a frightful childhood resulting in a truly traumatic event (no spoiler : a house fire). Eleanor is 30 and has zero friends, less than zero family, a poorly paid job, doesn\u2019t speak to her co-workers, doesn\u2019t even have a cat or a dog or a budgie or a little worm as a pet. Not even a little tiny worm! Eleanor has a ridiculously pompous conversational style. So unfamiliar with normal human interaction is Eleanor that she has not realised that most people do not want to be spoken to as if they are in a posh drawing room in the 1950s. It\u2019s like she has lived without tv or radio or newspapers or magazines or anything. Example number one :\u201cLet us retire to an inn or public house, Raymond \u2013 a quiet one \u2013 and please, allow me to buy you some beer in recompense for this wasted evening.\u201dExample two :\u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay long \u2013 just show face; have a cup of tea, eat a sausage roll \u2013 you know the drill.\u201d Said Raymond. \u201cWell I hope they\u2019ve at least got a high meat content and friable pastry, \u201c I said.Example three: when she gets a cat (oops, spoiler!) she says :I will assume the mantle of care\u2026 This creature will be looked after assiduously.Example four :\u201cYou\u2019re a good worker, Eleanor,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long has it been now \u2013 eight years?\u201d\u201cNine,\u201d I said.\u201cNine years, and you\u2019ve never had a day off sick, never used all your annual leave. That\u2019s dedication, you know. It\u2019s not easy to find these days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not dedication, \u201c I said. \u201cI simply have a very robust constitution and no one to go on holiday with.\u201dYes, it\u2019s quite funny, but now, come on Gail Honeyman, no one is as loopy or brusque or unaware as that. Even Eleanor would know her remark was inappropriate, embarrassing, too much information \u2013 even if she meant it to be funny, which she didn\u2019t, because, like any Vulcan, she has no sense of humour. She is the source of the humour but never understands why anyone is laughing. It did occur to me that Eleanor was somewhere on the autism spectrum but that is never alluded to in the novel. Has Gail Honeyman created an Asperger Syndrome character without realising it or is she just playing Eleanor for some pretty easy laughs? As well as not knowing how real people talk to each other, Eleanor has no knowledge of popular culture. She has not heard of Laurel and Hardy (\u201cthe film was about a fat, clever man and a thin, stupid man who\u2019d joined the Foreign Legion. They were patently unsuited to it\u201d) ; and yet she namedrops J D Salinger and the Unabomber. She doesn\u2019t know what parking meters are :\u201cI\u2019ll need to run, Eleanor \u2013 the car\u2019s on the meter and you know what those wardens are like if you go a minute over.\u201dI had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but I let it pass.As you see there are some nice comedy moments. Here\u2019s another favourite : we all know about product placement on tv and in movies. How about reverse-product placement? This is where you aggressively badmouth a specific item quite gratuitously. Eleanor is observing someone else\u2019s basket of purchases in a supermarket :Eggs, bacon, orange juice and Nurofen tablets. I had to stop myself from leaning forward and explaining that he was wasting his money \u2013 this branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was in fact ibuprofen 200 mg, the generic version of which was readily available for sale at perhaps one-quarter of the price. For 70% of the time this novel is gentle comedy, of the sort you can find in sitcoms like Not Going Out or The Vicar of Dibley if the Vicar had a brain injury. But then begins the process of Eleanor thawing out and assuming a more \u201cnormal\u201d shape. The great thing about this novel now emerges. This novel believes in ordinary human kindness as the thing which can save us, and not romantic love, and that is a great message which is very rarely heard. But the normalising of Eleanor has some disturbing aspects. Quite often it\u2019s like a rerun of Georgy Girl, the folksy hit by The Seekers from 1966.  Hey there, Georgy girl Swingin' down the street so fancy-free Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there - inside you Hey there, Georgy girl Look at all the boyfriends you don\u2019t get Never had a real one yet, just look at the clothes you wear You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy Just shed those dowdy feathers and fly - a little bitAnd the dowdy feathers are indeed shed \u2013 cue humorous sketches involving bikini waxes, new hairdos and new clothes. \u201cBut Miss Oliphant\u2026 you\u2019re beautiful!\u201d is almost said by at least two characters. Well. I absolutely don\u2019t want to kick this novel down the cellar steps and have it look back up at me all begrimed with cobwebs and sing \"Where is Love?\" through big blobby tears. I love the gospel of ordinary human kindness here, even though it\u2019s wrapped up in some fairly disgraceful looksism and evangelical therapyspeak towards the end. I argued myself up down and sideways about Eleanor Oliphant and finally copped out with a rueful three stars. This is a nice novel. I should be nice to it.", "Eleanor Oliphant lives a fairly secluded life due to her lack of social graces and crippling self esteem and anxiety issues. She works at a graphic design firm in the finance department and spends the rest of her time at home, usually drinking. Her social life consists of a phone call with her mummy every week. Then one day she goes to a concert, for which she won tickets in a raffle, and falls in love at first sight with a musician. Eleanor decides to make some changes to herself as part of a plan to get her dream man. Meanwhile a new hire in the IT department of her company, Raymond, strikes up a friendship with Eleanor. As things change for Eleanor she is forced to confront the past and confront the real reason for her recent desire for more. I really enjoyed this, oh man Eleanor is so quirky and endearing. Her inner monologue was excellent and I could really relate to her. I had an especially visceral reaction when (view spoiler)[ she is at the concert and suddenly feels disgusted with herself when she realizes she's been projecting this whole time and created a fantasy in her head and just feels foolish  (hide spoiler)] because come on who hasn't had a moment like that. I've had my fair share of moments when I try really hard and then just feel embarrassed and stupid about everything I've done. Eleanor just felt so real and human. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending when (view spoiler)[ we find out her mother isn't alive she was imagining it  (hide spoiler)] because it felt unnecessary and I didn't think we needed a plot twist like it kind of ruined all her conversations with her mom for me a little bit. Everything else was really great though, definitely 4.5 stars.", "I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I'll admit, when I started reading Gail Honeyman's debut novel, \nEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine\n, I thought about issuing a moratorium on quirky characters who can't seem to pick up social cues or are oblivious to how people usually behave when interacting with peers, coworkers, those who provide service, and others. Obviously these are colorful characters to write about\u2014it seems as if the literary world is full of them.But the more time I spent with Eleanor Oliphant, I realized that her behavior was more the result of circumstance than will, nurture if you will, rather than nature. And then I thought about how boring the world might be if everyone acted the way they were expected to, said the right things, and never expressed their true feelings. (Lord knows if I couldn't roll my eyes, my head might explode.)Eleanor lives by her routines. She eats the same meals, wears the same clothes, has her weekly chat with Mummy, and has her weekend rituals, which include frozen pizza and enough vodka to keep her pleasantly drunk all weekend. For the most part, she eschews interactions with her coworkers, whom she mostly thinks are daft and lazy. They make fun of her both behind her back and in front of her, and she doesn't really care.\"I do not light up a room when I walk into it. No one longs to see me or hear my voice. I do not feel sorry for myself, not in the least. These are simply statements of fact.\"Two things happen which throw her routines off-kilter. First, while attending a concert with a coworker, she spots a handsome musician and is quickly smitten. She has decided that he is the one for her, and starts to ready herself for their first encounter, during which she knows he'll sweep her off her feet and they'll live happily ever after. She needs a makeover and new clothes, and she starts doing research on her soon-to-be-beloved.Meanwhile, one afternoon she and Raymond, the IT guy from her office, whom she considers poorly groomed and a bit bumbling, save the life of an elderly man who falls in front of them. Saving Sammy's life suddenly gives Eleanor two unexpected relationships, friendships, that she has never had before. She still acts the way she believes to be appropriate, and says things that most wouldn't, but she begins liking the feeling of belonging, of companionship, which she never realized she wanted.\"Some people, weak people, fear solitude. What they fail to understand is that there's something very liberating about it, once you realize that you don't need anyone, you can take care of yourself. That's the thing: it's best just to take care of yourself. You can't protect other people, however hard you try. You try, and you fail, and your world collapses around you, burns down to ashes.\"Eleanor's social awkwardness, her lack of a filter, her inability to grasp exactly how people expect her to behave, actually hides a great deal of secret pain, pain and memories even she has hidden. And when she is forced to start recognizing just what a burden she has carried for so much of her life, and who was responsible, it threatens to break her. Suddenly she realizes she may need to do something she never has\u2014depend on others, and reveal things about herself she's always kept hidden, in order to move forward. If she wants to.\nEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine\n is really a special book. Even if some of Eleanor's behaviors are similar to other quirky characters you might have seen, she is totally unique, and while off-putting, just absolutely wonderful. You both marvel and are saddened by the burdens she has carried, and how she copes with them. I found myself becoming protective of her, worrying there would come an instant where someone made a total fool out of her (with her own help, of course).Honeyman really did a terrific job with Eleanor. Even as she began letting down her guard, Honeyman kept her character consistent, but never let her become unsympathetic. While this is certainly Eleanor's story, I liked the other characters as well, although they certainly didn't get as much attention. I thought the ending was a little too pat for my taste, but I really enjoyed this overall, and don't think I'll be forgetting Eleanor or her story anytime soon.God bless the people who challenge our notions of \"appropriate\" and \"normal,\" because they are what keeps our world interesting!\n\n\n\n", "What an absolutely fantastic character Eleanor is, a character that grew on me the more I read. She has had a scarred childhood, though we don't learn exactly what happened until later in the story, she wears the evidence on her face. She remembers little from that time only knows she was burned in a fire. Raised in a series of group homes, given an apartment by social services who still check on her though she is now thirty. She has few social skills, is very matter of fact, has no friends, few filters and has a schedule that she keeps to, a job she likes and insists she is fine. Until a crush with a musician and an IT guy named Raymond derails her schedule and her life.Why did I give this five stars? It is a first book, with nary a misstep, an assured book with amazing writing and character development. Plus it is difficult to take a book with so few characters, and not only make it interesting enough to keep the reader immersed, but to let us see the way Eleanor changes and grows throughout the story. There is much humor, there is also sadness and I came to embrace this character in all her strangeness, loved when she figured things out and came to terms with her past. There are a few places where the author could have gone overboard on sweetness but she kept true to the character of Eleanor and just managed to stay on the border, without crossing over. This is a book I will remember, it was that good and meaningful, in my opinion. Looking forward to great things from this new author, she is a true talent. Thanks to my friend Esil who told me to grab this one.ARC from publisher.", "At first it\u2019s easy to think that Eleanor is just a quirky social misfit with no friends and no social life and she is, but I soon found out that there is so much more to Eleanor and so much more to learn about her. It\u2019s a lonely life she leads and she says everything is fine but we learn eventually that it isn\u2019t, and that life hasn\u2019t ever been fine. While hints of what happened to her are slowly divulged, we never really find out everything until the end . It\u2019s heartbreaking to learn why she drowns herself in alcohol and fantasizes about a guy in a band, wanting a guy to love her, scars and all, the ones on the outside and those in her heart.Although, there is some humor to be found here, this really is such a profoundly sad story. I found it very difficult to read at times, especially hearing the disturbing things that she tells us her mother says to her in their weekly conversations. She\u2019s ridiculed and laughed at by her coworkers except for the seemingly odd Raymond, the IT guy with whom she becomes friends. Suddenly Eleanor Is living parts of the life that her past had taken away from her. She slowly gets to know a little of the world that she had hidden herself from for so many years behind the walls of her apartment and large quantities of vodka. I\u2019m almost at a loss for anything further to say, except that I\u2019m sorry I waited so long to read this book. I didn\u2019t get to it right away because I really thought it was just another quirky book and I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. It\u2019s about how people can impact each other\u2019s lives in unbearably awful ways and how others rise to save them. A fantastic debut that is not to be missed.", "What an emotional roller coaster, this book! I laughed. I thought about crying. I was angry. I was delighted. I was empathetic. I was completely fine, sometimes. What started out as a book that could have easily been called A Woman Called Eleanor ended up being far superior to that Ove stuff. There were legit moments that made me laugh, and the book turned in directions that were hard to get through, assuming you have a heart inside your chest that beats about 65bpm as mine does. A heart that feels emotion and pumps blood at the same time. Have you one of those? Are you human? This could have easily been just a three-star, that was nice, thanks, see ya later kind of book. It wasn\u2019t. It was a cut above that because it had memorable characters and situations and relationships and conditions and events and circumstances that made it a more powerful book than I anticipated. The last third of the book was heavy. This thing took me all over the place emotionally... and physically. I mean I guess I physically took this book all over the place since I read it on my phone and also listened to the audiobook. Whatever. I didn\u2019t read the synopsis. I just liked the cover and people I like liked the book so I just went for it. I\u2019m glad I did. I should go for more things in life. Take more risks. That\u2019s what life is all about. Taking risks and reading books without knowing too much about them.Life is also about other things, too. Some of those other life things can be found in the pages of this book. Others can\u2019t be found in any book because they just have to be experienced in, you know, real life. Experiences are good. So here\u2019s another book for me to recommend. If I recommend anything, it\u2019s worth your time. I don\u2019t recommend anything unless I\u2019m 100% sure everyone in the entire world will agree with me. So here I am, confidently recommending this book to you all because I know you will thoroughly enjoy it much the same way I did, and perhaps even more, but definitely not less. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t blame me. It\u2019s not my fault.", "Update.....I found a copy in my notes from last year ---Here is the review I wrote right after I read it. I realize - almost a year later I can still remember so much about this story: ELEANOR is a terrific character ... and this book is great!!! Even GROWS on you!!!Eleanor Oliphant, almost 30 years old, is one of those odd characters we think we may have seen before in our books --- lonely - awkward - lacking social skills. She doesn't have filters when it comes to saying what she's thinking. Yet....Eleanor Oliphant has a uniqueness that only she can claim. Eleanor goes to the same office job - M-F 8:30 to 5:30 every day. She works as a finance clerk. She takes an hour lunch break. We know her weekday supper routines and her weekend menu. Weekends are frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. Eleanor's life changes after she meets Raymond, a co-worker IT guy. His sloppy -unkempt style doesn't bother Eleanor-she never had any friends to begin with and she wasn't a fashion queen herself. Raymond and Eleanor help a man, Sammy, who took a fall -- and the three of them become allies for each other. They begin to unleash from their individual isolated livesand bond together in a heartwarming friendship. This story really makes you realize how valuable one friend can be. Eleanor had been stuck in ways she didn't even have the eyes to see - let alone do anything about it.But it's Raymond -his goodness- that ultimately helps Eleanor mend her broken heart....by helping her face areas of her painful childhood she has avoided. The story is broken down into three sections:. Good DaysBad Days Better Days Tender- touching - and plenty of heart. This is another book that I read last year\u2026 The book was given to me last summer. I wrote a review but I have no idea where it is. I do remember enjoying it!! I still have the book in my house. I'm walking now, I can research the review or look through the book later but it was quirky and enjoyable.......NEVER FOUND IT THROUGH GR's .... but I had a copy!", "I dare you not to think Elephant when you hear this title. This writer is so clever! We've got the first part of elephant at the beginning of her first name, and the rest of the elephant in the last name. No, of course this book is not about elephants, but the writer sometimes plays with words--and that alone is a selling point for me. Maybe it's sort of like subliminal advertising, except the author isn't trying to sell us elephants. Eleanor Oliphant. Elephant elephant elephant!I can get all analytical and talk about how Eleanor--the fact that half of her face is badly scarred and that no one knows (or dares to ask) how she got that way\u2014is the elephant in the room. (In fact, the author makes a pun once, referring to an Oliphant in the room.) And like an elephant, Eleanor Oliphant indeed fills the room, even though she would prefer that no one see her, that everyone leave her alone. The world is too scary to her and she is the poster child for anti-social behavior. In one venture she is completely delusional--she thinks her crush on a famous person will lead to marriage. She is a riot, but she has no idea she is. It's also true that she's sad and feels isolated and unlovable. Formal, literal, awkward, and very very funny in her skewed world view, are also part of her package. Routines, crossword puzzles, and vodka are her mainstays. I usually like oddball characters; Eleanor is definitely one of my favorites. Her character is so well-drawn, I'll remember her I'm sure.This book sure isn't all laughs and all light by any means. This is also a dark book. Something awful happened to Eleanor when she was a kid, and throughout the book we get hints about what it is. The ending had a very clever surprise that made me shake my head in wonder. I loved it. The middle of the book dragged a little for me, which made me call it a 4-star read at first. (I just had to change my rating to 5 stars, though--the book is just too damn good and I can't get Eleanor out of my head.) Eleanor has a hilarious adventure in a salon early on (one I just have to reread), and there's a lot of other funny energy. Absurd situations described in language that hopped, gave me the feeling that I was on an amusement ride. The author seemed \u201con\u201d, jazzed up, and I couldn\u2019t get off the ride even if I wanted to. Of course, I wanted the book to keep up that level of hilarity, and it didn't. Still, Eleanor was relentlessly fascinating, both her public, regular side (that\u2019s a poor choice of words because there is nothing regular about Eleanor) and her private, dark side. I recommend this book wholeheartedly. I'm shocked that this is a debut--it's so well-written, and the lovable, weird heroine is so so vivid. I'll be in line for the author's next book, although this book will be a hard act to follow.", "Eleanor Oliphant is NOT completely fine!Well, at least not at first!This book is a fantastic character study. The journey with quirky Eleanor through the past and present is bizarre at times, thought-provoking at others. But, I found it to be engaging no matter what. And, while it is mainly about Eleanor, there are a few other interesting characters met along the way as well. Such a fun ride!Also, I thought from the start of the book it was just going to be a general humor-fiction sort of book. But, there are some very dark and twisted elements that are encountered along the way that put this book in a class/genre all by itself. I truly don't think I have ever seen a book that combines dark mystery and humor quite the same way that this book does.You know, when I sat down to write this, I thought I was going to go 4 stars. But, in writing the paragraphs above and thinking about the uniqueness of the story and how engaged I was with Eleanor's journey, I am going to have to up it to 5 stars.Give this one a try! While you may recognize some of the elements, I think in the end, as a whole, it is a totally new experience.", "Eleanor Oliphant is one of the heroines of literature that I am sure I will remember always. She is brilliant, yet socially awkward. At the age of 10 she experienced a trauma that she never received any help with to sort through it. So, she repressed her memories and more importantly, she repressed her emotions. By the age of 30, she was so good at repression that it completely froze parts of her being and the underlying, unacknowledged fear of any of her repressions getting out were the root cause of her lack of social skills.When dealing with intellectual matters, she is formidable; her vocabulary and the facts at her fingertips are beyond many people\u2019s comprehension. Yet even as she grew and matured, some parts of her remained in the stunted, closed-in world of her 10-year-old self.Despite everything she had experienced, with both physical scars and those on her psyche, not once does Eleanor feel self-pity or get caught up in, \u201cI am a victim\u201d. She simply does not see herself that way and it is one of the reasons I admire her as a character to be honoured and respected.At her workplace, she meets the new IT guy Raymond, and her critique of him is definitely offhand and dismissive. Although they do eventually become friends, Eleanor has her sights set on someone else \u2013 far more glamourous, exciting, and sophisticated.When her world takes a nose dive, she is wise enough to know it is because of her own poor decisions based on influences from her past, and she takes brave measures to turn her life around with help from her friend Raymond. Her long and slow recovery is a testament to the human soul\u2019s willingness to strive and thrive against all odds.I found this book to be a compelling read, funny in places, deadly serious in other places, but always, always buoyed by Eleanor\u2019s determination and resilience. It was rewarding to watch her friendship with Raymond grow, and his support of her is inspiring.I loved this book; it is yet another amazing debut novel by an author I hope to read more of in the future. This one is going straight to my Favourites shelf, and I know that if ever I need inspiration, all I need do is think about Eleanor Oliphant!", "eleanor oliphant may be completely fine but i, on the other hand, am not. sigh.ugh. i feel so bad for not really enjoying this. this was the debut heard around the world, the debut that won numerous awards. and i saw so many people rave about this nonstop. but i think that was where i went wrong to begin with. the book blurb did not sound interesting to me in the least, so i probably shouldnt have picked it up to read just because everyone else was.next, eleanor drove me up the wall. im talking about driving me absolutely bananas. and i am definitely one of those people who if they dont like the character, then the book will be a massive struggle. which was the case here. especially because this story is almost completely character driven. theres not a whole lot going on the with the plot, so what drives most people to finish the book is desperately wanting to know \u2018what happened to eleanor?\u2019 and i did too, but not because i cared about eleanor as a character. only because i have an incessant need to know everything. lol.overall, i understood the message of the story, and whilst i agree that it was a good one in theory, it didnt personally impact me as much as i would have liked. just too many things got in the way, i suppose. but yay for everyone else who loved this - you all are much more patient and understanding than i am! \u21a0 2.5 stars", "Eleanor Oliphant is a thirty year old accounts receivable clerk who has a humdrum existence.

How delightfully quirky you are! This book..well..let's just say was one of the most unusual and gratifying journeys that I have ever been taken on in the literary world. Thank you, Gail Honeyman for creating such a wonderfully, unique character that is Ms. Eleanor Oliphant. And that name? I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E.I'm not going to attempt a summary of this book because that would seem slightly gratuitous. Therefore, I will simply say, that this novel is a character study of a woman, that is so unique, that I couldn't properly give a summation of her in words. This book, however, was not just rainbows and lollipops..it was much, much more. (view spoiler)[There was a MAJOR plot twist at the end that dealt with her relationship with her mother and I was like OH MY ?!?! WHAT!???? I have read a couple books recently about \"mother dearest\" issues. I just finished Good Me, Bad Me and now this. Pretty interesting coincidence to say the least. (hide spoiler)]Very, very good book. Definitely worth the read.", "4.5 stars!I just loved Eleanor! She is a loner and avoids social interactions and lives in isolation. She speaks out without thinking, to whatever pops in her mind. She has never received hugs, or held hands and has never felt loved, she never received anything when she was sad to cheer her up. Never received balloons and received a balloon from Raymond with Sponge Bob on it and it was so special to her. She never heard of Sponge Bob. She had an awful childhood with a scar on her face and bruises would show up all over her body. She had an emotional traumatic past. She was bought up in foster homes and then gets herself her own apartment from a social worker.Eleanor is now thirty years old and works in a office. She drinks a lot of vodka and spends time on the weekends talking to her Mummy on the telephone. She drinks her vodka so she can forget her traumatic past, all what she remembers is a fire. She then goes through counseling and things come together and she remembers everything thathappened in her traumatic pastShe then meets Raymond and things start to change for her, she finally meets a friend. She is in love with a famous musician. That is how quirky she is, she actually wants a relationship with him. Her relationship with Raymond builds and it works for her. She then goes through counseling and things come together and she remembers everything that happened in her traumatic past. She is changing and turns out being very brave. She is so humorous. I just loved Eleanor.My ThoughtsThis book really made me feel so many emotions!! I laughed, I cried, tears running down my face. I cheered for Eleanor near the end. I loved this book. It really made me feel! I just loved Eleanor.It was a slow burn but the book started building suspense when I read about her scar on her face and had to find out why. Then it got me turning the pages to find out what happened. I was so surprised when I found out what happened. It was so sad and heartbreaking what she went through. While I was reading this I thought it was a whole different genre in what I usually read, it wasn't a thriller but it was the mystery of what happened that turned this into a page turner. Once all the pieces came together, I fell in love with this book. I can understand why it was a little slow, you needed to really get to know Eleanor. Once I started loving Eleanor that is when it started getting really good. I then couldn't put it down. Eleanor will make you laugh, she will make you cry, and she will have you cheering her on. If you love a book that will make you feel, this is the one for you!! I loved it.This book was an awesome character driven novel. I just loved Eleanor's character.", "4.5 stars! Oh Eleanor, I desperately wanted to reach into this story and hug you (even though a hug would be extremely awkward for you) and welcome your quirky self into my life!Eleanor\u2019s journey took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Eleanor is obliviously socially awkward. She had me laughing out loud on one page and then holding back tears while breaking my heart on the next. Eleanor Oliphant is one of the most remarkable characters I have ever \u2018met\u2019! Eleanor\u2019s inner thoughts (and often her outspoken words) had me giggling throughout every chapter. Her relationship with her mother and memories of her childhood had me cringing and shaking my head in disbelief.  While reading this book, I couldn\u2019t help comparing it to the quirkiness of The Rosie Project which I absolutely loved. I just couldn\u2019t help but smile and melt at Eleanor\u2019s rationalizations for each of her thoughts and actions. She is quite a woman! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would highly recommend it! ", "Tragic comedies with WTF endings with broken characters should be my all time favorite genre.I read this book 2 years ago and I wanted to reread some parts to make myself remember how ultra amazing read should be so I can make my further choices wiser.Eleanor has intimacy issues, having hard time to make friends, spending weekends with frozen pizza and vodka to reward herself. The storyline seems like a typical New Yorker\u2019s story but it\u2019s not. She seems all right but she is not. She is in deep pain and her weekly talks with her mother doesn\u2019t help to gather her strength and make some changes with her life until one day she meets IT guy from her office named Raymond. Their slow-burn friendship, helping each other in different parts of life, confessing their secrets make them inseparable. This book is smart, entertaining, heartbreaking, confusing, shocking, twisty, edgy, tragic, funny. It gives you all kinds of different feelings at the same time and with its remarkable but no surprising ending, you just take a long breath and tell yourself: \u201cWow! This one is special! Really unique and unforgettable!\u201dThis is not romance and second chance book. This is self-discovery, grief, learning to forgive yourself and trusting people, friendship book which broke my heart but then healed it with its promising, heartwarming and beautiful conclusion. I think this book will keep its place at my top ten best reads that I\u2019ve ever had.Well done! It\u2019s pleasure to visit my memory lane and read again this incredible book and good to see one of my favorite quirky, weird but also likeable character one more time.", "I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about \u201cEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, \u201c but I must admit I was somewhat reluctant to read it. I\u2019ve recently read several novels about social misfits like Eleanor and felt like I needed a break from that type of character. Also, Gail Honeyman is a debut author whose work was only discovered through a writing competition. (How good could she be?) I decided to give Eleanor half an hour, but after only ten minutes of reading I was totally hooked and my reluctance and skepticism were thrown out the window. Despite the tremendous amount of pain Eleanor has experienced, the book is funny, poignant, charming, touching, joyful, and an absolute wonder. Finish whatever you\u2019re currently reading and without delay start \u201cEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine.\u201d All those rave reviews are right - Gail Honeyman is an exceptional author and this is a novel not to be missed.Thank you to Penguin Viking and NetGalley for an advance copy of this book.", "Eleanor makes a great pretense of being fine. She manages her days with the help of vodka and by not engaging with others. Then, a chance event with a co-worker helping a man that has fallen in the street leads to the beginning of social engagement. At the same time, she thinks she has found the love of her life; a good looking rock musician that she doesn't actually know. This books reads like a mystery. I kept turning pages to see how things would evolve. And to find out what about her past has made her the way she is. How did she get the scar on her cheek? Apparently, Mommy is to blame and is currently locked up. For some reason, I was expecting something like A Man Called Ove. But unlike that book, there's no dark humor here. Just sadness that someone has obviously been so mistreated. But there is also hope and faith and confirmation in the good of most people. Reading about Eleanor\u2019s awakening is heart warming. I just loved this book. I would give it more than five stars if I could.Update - I just re-read this for my bookclub. This time around, I picked up more on the subtle humor more. Eleanor reminds me of Doc Martin, totally lacking in social skills. And again, it made me appreciate those people, like Raymond, who can see beyond the superficial to the true person beneath. \u201cI noticed him glance at me, and then he slowed his steps to match mine. I realized that such small gestures...such things could mean so much. I wondered how it would feel to perform such simple deeds for other people.\u201d This is just such a great book. A keeper for all times. ", "\"These days, loneliness is the new cancer \u2013 a shameful, embarrassing thing, brought upon yourself in some obscure way. A fearful, incurable thing, so horrifying that you dare not mention it; other people don\u2019t want to hear the word spoken aloud for fear that they might too be afflicted, or that it might tempt fate into visiting a similar horror upon them.\"I couldn\u2019t help but think that the above presumption somehow rings quite true in this day and age. If we look around and see so many interacting personally with their cell phones rather than one another, and think about the hordes of people sitting at home in front of the television watching mindless shows or playing video games, and those of us\u2026 ahem, sitting at our computers alone but attempting to engage with others online \u2013 I am nearly convinced that loneliness could very well be a disease of this technologically advanced century. Eleanor Oliphant certainly knows something about loneliness. In fact, it was this issue that really stood out for me the most in this novel. I mean, yes, there are a number of other problems to reflect on here as well \u2013 alcoholism, mental abuse, and physical abuse for starters. And then it seems we could also touch on Asperger\u2019s. In fact, I think you could open up a copy of a DSM-5 if you had one handy (I didn\u2019t) and slap quite a few official diagnoses under Eleanor\u2019s name. However, I really don\u2019t mean to make light of any of Eleanor\u2019s problems because even just one of these would be enough to make me feel for this quirky and solitary soul. Initially, Eleanor is a bit unlikeable\u2026 judgmental, aloof, and not always very nice \u2013 she just might tell you exactly what she thinks. She is also quite funny\u2026 not purposefully, of course, but I dare you not to laugh about some of her observations! In the very least, you may nod your head. \"I do feel that tube tops are best suited to the under twenty-fives, if, indeed, they are suited to anyone.\" And then she little by little grows on you as you learn her story and you not only sympathize with her, you might actually find yourself caring for her and cheering her on.  There are a number of excellent reviews out there so I won\u2019t dwell more on Eleanor\u2019s personal history or the plot here. The balance seems to be overwhelmingly tipped in favor of this book, but there are some fantastic reviews that also sit on the other side of the scale and are well worth their weight. There were some things that bugged me while reading this - a number of inconsistencies in Eleanor\u2019s character, for example. She would say one thing and then act in an opposing manner. An unbelievable love interest comes to mind immediately. And what about the vodka binge drinking? \"Vodka is, for me, merely a household necessity, like a loaf of bread or a packet of tea.\" Does one quit this without a recovery process? Are there no withdrawal symptoms? Okay, enough said about that. However, despite several of these inconsistencies, I could not help being entirely charmed by this novel! I seriously adored Raymond! I like to think that there really is that nice guy (or gal) out there that will make a difference in someone\u2019s life \u2013 a person who doesn\u2019t necessarily shine when you first glance at him or her, but one with that unassuming presence whose friendship is truly priceless. My personal enjoyment of the book as well as the importance of bringing the issue of loneliness into the forefront are what tipped the scale in the right direction for me.\"There\u2019s no shame, you know, no shame at all in being\u2026 depressed, or having a mental illness or whatever...\"", "Eleanor Oliphant has learned how to survive - but not how to live...Eleanor Oliphant is happy. Nothing is missing from her carefully timetabled life. Except, sometimes, everything...This is a sad and at the same time, strangely enough a fun story. I read a quote on the cover \"A story about the very worst and very best that humans are capable of... Funny, brave and utterly devastating\". That about sums it up. It's a pretty tragic story about Eleanor Oliphant, a lonely peculiar lady with a severely damaged personality due to her past. Literally scarred. A loner, at the office and in her life in general and that's the sad basis of this story. At the same time, the story is quirky, funny, heart warming and tender. I really loved Raymond! The type of guy who is a bit 'underdressed' and 'too good for the world' as we say in Dutch, always helpful and friendly. He isn't put off by Eleanor's slightly weird behaviour and soon becomes a true friend. Loved this character! I've read some of the reviews here, some critical. I can see the points these are making. Still, this book kept me going and going.... Say around 3.8 rating going on 4. A moving story with a twist at the end....and let's say Eleanor learns how to live with a little help... on the way. More to follow.", "I loved this book. It took a while, but I fell in love with it. I finished reading it whilst I was at a cafe and realised how much of a trance I was in when I looked up and noticed my surroundings. This is the story of Eleanor Oliphant, a 30 year old woman who's suffered a lot. The tone of the book is quiet, steady and slowly reveals her life to the reader. You can sense something traumatic has happened, but you're unsure, because Eleanor is unsure. Slowly, it is uncovered, and thus this is the journey we follow.In between all of that, we look at her life. We're inside her mind and perceive her world the way that she sees it, with humorous and witty observations about pretty much everything that catches her eye. You laugh, but also feel this sense of sadness for her, because she's alone most of the time. But she's fine, or so she thinks. The story looks at the concept of loneliness extremely well. It hurts to read, but the reality of the matter is, loneliness is not healthy as we all know. This is different to solitude, but the need to connect with another human being is strong and innate in this book, and if not met, can cause damage to ones psyche. It was painful to follow Eleanor on this realisation that she was alone. Has been for most of her life. So how does she fix this? How does she battle the demons that've been buried for so long?This book is a beautifully, written journey I became fixated on. There's pain, but growth and absolute attachment to Eleanor. I couldn't get enough of it.", " !! NOW AVAILABLE !!4.5 StarsEleanor Oliphant is lacking the social awareness that would have her filter her comments, or even consider for a moment that she needs to do so. She\u2019s a unique individual with a unique view on the world and how it works \u2013 especially as it relates to people.\u201dAnimals, birds and insects can provide such useful insights. If I\u2019m ever unsure as to the correct course of action, I\u2019ll think, \u2018What would a ferret do?\u2019 or \u2018How would a salamander respond to this situation?\u2019 Invariably, I find the right answer.\u201dApproaching 30 years old, Eleanor is a charming, quirky, socially na\u00efve, emotionally awkward young woman who leads a lonely life, she has worked in the same office for eight years now, in the same job, a finance clerk. She has her routine down and no aspirations for the future of rising in the ranks. An hour for lunch, her crossword puzzles, her weekly conversations with Mummy, these are the constants of her life. Variations in routine send her into a momentary tizzy; too many deviations send her reaching for her vodka. She avoids socializing, but will make an appearance as needed for a work related event, but only to avoid more unwanted attention that she would undoubtedly be subjected to should she choose not to attend. Ideally, she would prefer to blend in with the paintings on the walls, the furniture, the woodwork. That is, until she sees him, the man Mummy always told her would be right for her. For him, she might risk being seen.When she requires IT help at work, she meets Raymond, she does a quick assessment of his grooming and wardrobe shortcomings, while he is new enough not to be put off by her awkwardness, he leaves her feeling as though he views her as normal \u2013 which in itself is an oddity in her workplace. In the awkward getting-to-know-you phase of a work friendly relationship, Raymond and Eleanor happen to be in the right place at the right time, at least for Sammy Thom, when they see him collapse in the street. Suddenly, they are thrust into Sammy\u2019s life, sitting bedside at his hospital bed, hoping for his recovery, meeting his family, and becoming an extended part of Sammy\u2019s family. Eleanor is prodded into forsaking her routines, stepping outside of her comfort zone once Raymond and Sammy enter the picture. She begins to feel noticed in a good way, and begins to try to believe in life, in goodness. Believe in someone besides Mummy. Little by little I was charmed by this overwhelmed, damaged woman-child, her odd view of the world, her dislike of proper grammar when texting, her take on \u201chuman mating rituals\u201d such as flirting, her incredulity that anyone would want to be her friend, her slow unearthing of her own voice, her discovery that others might enjoy her company. It felt a little bit like that iconic moment in 1984\u2019s Academy Award\u2019s acceptance speech, when Sally Field said: \u201cYou like me, right now, you like me!\u201d \u201d I was getting to quite like my own voice, my own thoughts. I wanted more of them. They made me feel good, calm even. They made me feel like me.\u201dAlthough this covers some rather calamitous childhood events, it is done without any sensationalism. It incorporates some of the coping mechanisms, as well as some of the causes of the physical and emotional scars of her childhood. Eleanor Oliphant shows us the significance of kindness, the consequence of the absence of kindness, and the magnitude of even a small gesture of kindness. A wonderfully uplifting debut novel!

He\u2019s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne\u2019s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers\u2014one they are determined to conceal.A year later, they\u2019re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571423190l/41057294.jpg", "title": "Normal People", "authors": "Sally Rooney", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057294-normal-people", "reviews": ["\nNo one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.\nThis is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, I think I liked it. And I say \"liked it\" in the sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not quite, and it is a profoundly lonely and depressing love story.I didn't begin by liking it. Normal People follows two characters - Marianne and Connell - through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind of John Green for adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed, marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet, I could not stop caring about them.\nNot for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.\nThe story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell's mum works as a cleaner for Marianne's family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social status cause much conflict.In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a social world filled with social expectations. There's a bit of a When Harry Met Sally vibe, except that this book is more soul-destroying.\nNothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.\nThere's clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might give up who they love the most because they can't deal with how it makes them look to others.The pair's inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much. I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hated Normal People, but I didn\u2019t. I actually kinda loved it. It's a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they don't - in each other.

A sigh is an exhalation and I have no idea how any attempt to suppress a sigh by inhaling could possibly sound like one. I\u2019ve tried hard to imagine it, but no luck. I\u2019ve tried even harder to do it, but even less luck. In fact, in an effort to understand this twaddle I have tried it so often that I have come close on several occasions to hyperventilating and passing out.What have those Faber editors been doing? Maybe they have no problem with it because they are all so much cleverer than me and know how to read properly. Or maybe they also tried to do it and actually did pass out, which might explain why they have failed to apply the editorial pencil with any intelligence in the 264 pages that follow.The more likely explanation, of course, is that the problem is mine \u2013 and I offer the following gems from Normal People on that understanding\u2026 \u2022 \u2018He looks down into his lap, and exhales quickly, almost like a cough\u2019.It\u2019s hyperventilation time again. I\u2019ve imagined it and I\u2019ve tried it, but I still don\u2019t get it. \u2022 \u2018He can\u2019t even visually imagine himself as a lawyer, wearing a tie and so on..\u2019Do we really need that \u2018visually\u2019? \u2022 \u2018It\u2019s true she is Connell\u2019s type, maybe even the originary model of the type:\u2019Originary?

I could go on. It\u2019s not often that I feel the need to read with a pencil in my hand but Normal People drove me to it, and my copy is now covered with question marks and annotations. I retired from teaching last year but reading Sally Rooney\u2019s feted novel felt like I was marking again - in this case marking the work of a precocious, but overindulged, talent.In 'Normal People' alternating points of view are combined with an inconsistent and confusing authorial presence, voices are often difficult to differentiate in an ineffectual free indirect style, the comma splices (Ferrante this isn\u2019t) and the unpunctuated dialogue, far from creating an impressionistic flow, suggest a lack of precision, and the prose shifts from past to present for no apparent reason and even within paragraphs, creating a chronological blur. In short, it's a bit of a mess. If I cared about the characters or cared about the story, these things would not matter quite so much but on the few occasions when I saw through the writerly mess I found it difficult to care about them at all.The novel, though, has been so well received that its very reception has become a news story. \u2018Salinger for the Snapchat generation\u2019: critics unite to praise 27 year-old novelist\u2019 was the headline in last Saturday\u2019s Guardian.So the problem is clearly mine. Maybe I've read a different book from the one everyone is raving about. Maybe I've read the same book but don't know how to read properly. Or it could be that I'm the child's voice at the back of the crowd politely suggesting that the emperor might not be wearing any clothes.", "Sally Rooney is the real dealNormal People has been lavished with praise from critics, longlisted for the Man Booker prize and is being adapted for television by the BBC. And that's just in the first week! All that attention will, no doubt, attract quite a few readers who would not ordinarily touch this subject with a barge pole. Because this book:A)\tIs about young peopleB)\tIs a love story (but not a 'romance')C)\tContains a fair bit of sex (which is crucial to the story, btw, and is not graphic)All of which (possibly also the fact that the author is a 27-year-old woman) means that Normal People will inevitably be dismissed by some as frivolous. It isn\u2019t. This is a confident, accomplished and serious work. Of Rooney\u2019s debut, Conversations with Friends, I said in my review it \u2018occasionally scrapes close to the bone\u2019. Well, Normal People cuts to the core.Normal People is not out to inspire, instruct, entertain or talk down to anyone, which makes it something of a refreshing anomaly in current fiction about young people. It is a novel (for anyone, young or old) that simply presents the truth of youthful experiences without the filters of nostalgia or sentimentality. It invites you to inhabit the psyche of someone else \u2013 two someone elses: Connell and Marianne \u2013 to identify with them and to feel their pain and turmoil. For the reader who connects to that, it is wracking. The story focuses only on the pivotal moments for these two characters, jumping forward three weeks, six months, or five minutes, as needed, to excise all the uneventful bits of life and leave us with the most emotionally intense supercut possible. It follows them from high school in a small town, through their years at university in Dublin, as the dynamic between them shifts with their surroundings and social circle. They\u2019re not officially 'together' the whole time, or even most of the time, but they always figure in each other\u2019s lives in a significant way.Sally Rooney writes with such precision that this all feels painfully true. She conjures the tension and emotion in a scene just from the way someone wrings out a dish sponge; she conveys the full weight of feeling from a look or a shrug. In Rooney\u2019s imagining, Connell and Marianne as separate entities are less important than the interplay between them \u2013 their relationship dynamic and the influence each of them has on shaping the other, that\u2019s the real stuff of this book: \n\"How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.\"\n\nThere\u2019s irony here, and self-conscious posturing (though not nearly as much as in CWF), but earnestness, truth and kindness as well. In addition to the central relationship are issues of class and intellectual integrity. It's a particularly astute look at the rebuild of self that teenagers undergo in the transition from school to uni, how it allows some to thrive while others stumble, and in some ways is just an illusion after all. So there\u2019s hype and there\u2019s backlash to the hype, and Normal People is sure to resonate powerfully with some readers and not at all for others. If you like a minutely observed novel about people and feelings that isn\u2019t mawkish, I'd say give it a go.", "I am not sure how to write this review because I seem to be so far beyond the pale on my antipathy to this book. In simplest terms I didn't connect with this work at all and I would be best to chalk this up to a \"reader/writer\" mismatch and move on but I will try and articulate some of my reading experience.Some of my perplexity with Normal People is that I just couldn't relate to the twenty something, highly educated, politically aware and cynical young adults that populate this novel. I am not sure how reflective these voices are of young Irish making their way in the world, but as presented here I found them exasperating to listen to and not particularly nuanced. It is possible that even if I didn't enjoy the novel I might like the writing but in actual fact Rooney's style is perhaps the single biggest thing that bugged me. I found some passages of interest sandwiched between a lot of wooden dialogue and these flat descriptions ... Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing people's plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of a bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the others This kind of writing really gives me nothing. Others have cited the two dimensional nature of her secondary characters and I would concur. Barely any of them made much of an impression on me. Alan - Marianne's brother, seemed particularly badly drawn. He appears to be a key part of understanding Marianne and yet he warrants only a few pen-strokes of unexplained malice and cruelty. The opening of a wine-bottle and pouring of cups of tea receives much more page space. I tried to understand Marianne, who seems to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. Her hinted at troubled family life was suppose to underpin her need to be a submissive. I remain unconvinced that this is really how dominance and submission works and I would think experts in BDSM might strongly take issue with some of the cliches here. The relationship between Marianne and Connell should have kept this book afloat at the very least. The intense emotional and physical connection, the will they / won't they stay together, all the drama of YA love is here but it is in an eye-wateringly navel-gazing form. I found it all exactingly po-faced. The number of inexplicable break-ups, largely based on mis-communication was about three or four break-ups too many for me. I just wanted to yell at this novel most of the time. Say what you mean and stop being so insufferably difficult !, either split up or stay together, both your friends and I really don't care !. Marianne and Connell were of most interest to me when they started emailing each other, discussing novels and politics thus preventing them breaking up over some new emotional minutiae. Perhaps this should have been a novel of their email exchanges.Oh well, I guess I will never be a Rooney fan and I have doubtless missed the point of this book entirely but that is ok not every book is for every reader.", " Man booker prize long list nominee and Costa book awards nominee This is a book that has many admirers and sadly it didn't work for me and while I would love to agree with all the judges on this one I only struggled to the end because it was a bookclub read. It is difficult to go against the grain on a book that is nominated for so many awards. So as always you  need to judge for yourself because books fit people differently  Quite simply this book didn't  Fit Me. I really have no interest in reading about 18-20 something year college kid's on/off sexual relationships where they seem to only exist in their own little complex bubble and this book felt like a bubble. It is described as \"exquisite love stroy\" which I honestly found nothing exquisite or no love in this one. The characters of Connell and Marianne were dislikable and boring and the on / off, will they wont they \"relationship\" became repetitive reading. The only character which I liked and felt any connection with in the novel was Lorraine.Perhaps this is more suited for a younger audience where they connect with the college scene or for readers who like complex relationship stories but for me this was a struggle from start to finish.", "\nI picked up my cup of coffee and took a large gulp, swishing the liquid around in my mouth a little before swallowing.

This is, um, this is... this book is everywhere right now, being highly praised and all that. Websites I trust are telling me this is, this is one of the best, one of the best books of the year so far. But, guys... wow. I\u2019ve never felt more disconnected from a story. I couldn\u2019t care less about either one of these characters, and I definitely didn\u2019t care about anyone else in the book because, man, I don\u2019t think the author cared either. This whole thing just felt lifeless to me, like it wanted to be something huge (and it sure is being pushed like it is), but there is really nothing about this book I found redeeming. I hung around until the end thinking something would resolve or the story would progress somehow, but it just kind of fizzles out and it\u2019s done. I wish it would have at least ended with an apology for taking up too much space in the crowded book world. Seriously, the whole back and forth of I love you, let\u2019s have sex, do whatever you want, we\u2019re different, I can\u2019t tell anyone about you, I love you, I\u2019m seeing someone else, I\u2019m so sad, life is hard, being 20 is tough... that is basically the book. It just kind of bounces around those themes over and over again. There\u2019s nothing in the book to make me care if these kids are in love or not, and it really feels like this should be a YA novel, but it pushed the characters ages up just a bit to say \u201cNope, no no no... adults here.

Connell is the popular jock who secretly cares what everyone thinks about him. Marianne is the school pariah--the girl who people create myths about. While they both feel alone and misunderstood, together they understand not only one another, but also themselves. When they start University, their roles reverse. No longer forced to keep their relationship a secret, they have other barriers to face--many which are dark and daunting. Both begin to spiral. It is only when they are together that they can face themselves and the world around them.Normal People could have been a whiny, angsty read about two very self-absorbed 18-to twenty-somethings, but the narrative structure and Rooney's writing elevates the characters and story to another level. The narrative is told through the inner workings of Connell and Marianne\u2019s minds. The reader is privy to their issues and disturbing thoughts. They are awkward and flawed characters, which made them feel very real. I was hoping for more growth, but the glimpse of hope at the end helped me realize that Connell and Marianne were ready to face the future. This is a very dark and disturbing read with some light at the end. While I came to care about Connell and Marianne\u2019s characters, I wouldn\u2019t want to read this again! \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t be like normal people.\u201d\n", "I had been influenced by a friend - whom I adore & respect - by her 1 star review.... way before this book started gaining momentum and hit the stores a month ago. This book wasn\u2019t for my friend - but it sure was for me. I\u2019ve own an \u2018Advance Reader\u2019s Edition\u2019, of Sally Rooney\u2019s paper copy for a year and a half. It sat on my shelf, unread. Rooney\u2019s first novel \u201cConversations With Friends\u201d, was wonderful. I admit having a thing for the type of writer Sally Rooney is:*Addicting* thought-provoking reading for me. \u201cNormal People\u201d is contemporary - romantic-tragic - comic - fresh - psychologically sharp - emotional - and very perceptive. Rooney leaves me lingering in her characters. They are flawed and frustrated. I \u2018felt\u2019 flawed and frustrated reading it! At times I wanted to scream at the characters - other times my heart just broke. I knew I wanted to read this novel. I even knew it would most likely drive me into my head. ( it did). I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t open it last year. The book-cover alone has that \u2018curl-up-and-get- sucked-in- feeling\u2019, to it. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. I COULD NOT STOP READING. \u2018Addicted\u2019! I will never doubt my own gut desire again when it comes to a Sally Rooney novel. I\u2019m a fan here to stay. Totally love what she creates. SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED IN ME, too, with respect to romance novels. I can no longer say...\u201cOh, I don\u2019t read romance novels\u201d... It depends...Heck, \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d, had romance. Loaded with power and cruelty... but still some romance. \u201cEast of Eden\u201d, by John Steinbeck was filled with juicy romance...( destructive force)... but still...lust and romance was present. Helen Hoang\u2019s book, \u201cThe Kiss Quotient\u201d, more modern, had romance written all over it. I loved it, too. Laugh at me if you wish...but in the same way that I got hooked on the two main characters, ( Tessa and Hardin), in Anna Todd\u2019s \u201cAfter Series\u201d.....( also a young author like Sally Rooney)....I was hooked on the relationship\u2019 between Connell and Marianne in \u201cNormal People\u201d. I\u2019m sure that Rooney would not turn this book into a series\u2026 but if she did, I\u2019d read it. The electricity and entanglement between this Connell and Marianne - was soooo complex. I wanted to join their conversations about their families\u2014about the way each felt about themselves, and each other.... and all the things that were happening to them. When I finished the last page, my mind continued swimming in thoughts. Most, I was sad to leave them. Soooo many fabulous sentences - page after page. Gorgeous reflective and intimate writing.

Or if you enjoy reading about \"in\" authors...look no further. After all, Rooney is \"defining a generation\".If you are thinking about reading this novel, I suggest you listen to the following song instead, since it will take you less time and you will get the same story:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjMwd...While I enjoyed Rooney's style, the way in which she interweaves ordinary moments with emotionally charged ones and the uncertainty that pervades her story, I was also annoyed by how artificial her novel is. I had the impression that Rooney was trying to conjure a certain millennial \"vibe\" through her characters and their experiences. However, the central figures of her novel, Connell and Marianne, lacked depth and, as stupid as it might sound, character. Their looks were emphasised in a way that made them \"stand out\" from others: they are skinny and beautiful, they smoke, they make languid movements, they are smart, and unlike their peers they actually care about world politics. Throughout the course of this novel we are told how DIFFERENT and SPECIAL they are. Marianne comes from a wealthy and abusive family (we are supposed to feel bad for her), Connell was raised by his mother and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression (we are also supposed to feel bad for him). That they have issues that they can't cope with is realistic, but what I didn't appreciate is the romanticising of their difficulties. What I didn't like is that being \"alienated\" is synonym of \"cool\" and that seeking sadomasochistic relationships is understandable/inevitable if you come from an abusive family. Rooney handles serious issues (eg. an abusive family, depression, etc.) very badly. A book that handles trauma and self-harming incredibly well is What Red Was by Rosie Price. There we see why the characters behave in self-destructive ways, but in NP these things seem merely props.Marianne and Connell aren't terrible people but god, they are so self-involved. Their relationship is made to appear fraught but I didn't always understand why. Drama for the sake of drama? They enter forgettable relationships with equally forgettable people but they remain fixated on each other. Why? No one knows...Marianne is depicted by the author and the other characters as being the sort of person who does not to care about others' opinion of her but soon after a breakup with a cliched dick boyfriend she is obsessed with what people are saying about her...Connor is...intelligent? Indecisive? As interesting as a stale sandwich?!Secondary characters and family members are barely sketched out, they have little to no purpose other than creating more \"drama\" for the main characters. Marianne's family was so badly written that I had a hard time taking any of them seriously. Her brother is laughably cruel and her mother is uncaring and snobbish (they are rich so...). Friends from college serve very little purpose, other than making the main characters seem \"different\" and \"real\" (they are special, not like other people).What I disliked the most is that by the end neither Marianne or Connell show any sort of character growth.  Not that I always want to read about characters who learn from their mistakes or gain some sort of insight from their experience, I can appreciate characters who keep perpetuating their 'bad' behaviour or even those who get worse or regress into 'bad' habits/behaviour. But they have to be believable. Marianne or Connell were not. They were merely an 'aesthetic', more befitting as subjects of a black and white grunge photo than anything else. The only reason why I finished this novel is that I listened to the audiobook and the narrator managed to make this otherwise unappetising storyline sort of okay.", "\nI genuinely have no idea how to rate this.

How thrilling that the author hailed as \"Salinger for the Snapchat generation\" is Irish, and from my own province of Connacht at that. There are moments in this novel that would certainly back up such a bold claim. But I believe that she is a writer still honing her craft. Not quite the finished article just yet, but with all the potential to become a literary heavyweight.In the beginning we meet Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up the west of Ireland. Marianne comes from a wealthy family and Connell's mother Lorraine is a cleaner in their lavish house. At the start of the book, the pair are in their final year at school - Connell is a popular sports star while Marianne is a social outcast. They are close despite operating in completely different circles. Roles are reversed once they move to Dublin for college - Marianne falls in with a group who appreciate her wit and intelligence, and a taciturn Connell finds it difficult to make friends. The story follows their on-off relationship over the years - they go from being pals, to more than that, to who knows? They are a huge part of one another's lives, no matter what their romantic status.Rooney is strong on the intricacies of relationships - how the influence of one person can shape another person's whole life, and how little misunderstandings can snowball into major heartbreak. At one point Connell discovers that becoming part of a couple can even validate one's existence: \"To be known as her boyfriend plants him firmly in the social world, establishes him as an acceptable person, someone with a particular status, someone whose conversational silences are thoughtful rather than socially awkward.\" She is also extremely perceptive about the journey from adolescence into adulthood, that point in your life where you fly the nest to take on the world and finally meet people with the same interests as yours - confident, excited and apprehensive all at once: \"They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.\"However, there were a couple of things that bugged me. For one, Marianne's family despise her, yet we are given no reason for this. The actions of her brother Alan, in particular, become more ridiculous as the story goes on, and without proper context they just feel ludicrous. And I'm afraid I found the dialogue quite flat at times. For two people like Marianne and Connell, who know each other so well, I kept thinking, is this how they would really speak to each other? Their exchanges are so earnest and dry. For example, there's one part where they are about to have sex after missing one other for so long, and the atmosphere is charged. They kiss. Marianne says that she wants this so much, and Connell goes: \"It's really nice to hear you say that. I'm going to switch the TV off, if that's OK.\" The description of the scene makes it sound passionate but the conversation dulls its effect.Maybe I'm nitpicking. There were many aspects of the book I really admired. It's just that when I see publications like The Guardian declaring Normal People a \"future classic\", I expect a bit more from it. I do think that Sally Rooney is massively talented, and her gifts of observation and empathy will serve her very well in her career. She may have the literary world at her feet right now, but I reckon her best work is yet to come.", "Wow! Check out the trailer of Hulu\u2019s adaptation of Normal People for Spring 2020!

But yes there are so many heavy, harsh, heart wrenching, brain cell boiling issues make you feel like hit by a truck several times, then suffered from waterboarding and torture conducted by American Psycho\u2019s Patrick Bateman and finally thrown away into the swamp,eaten by crocodiles. The characters deal with drug addiction, bullying, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, severe depression and it is really heartbreaking to see them not to have a regular teenager lives. And you know what after all those torturous feelings, my kindest part of soul( also my masochist brain cells and my vulnerable heart) loved those two characters, Connell and Marianne and witnessed their literally growing up, their adolescence and early adulthood times, forming friendship, special- sensitive bound. At first when they were in high school, Marianne is outcast, social pariah, bullied by mean girls as Connell is shiny, popular star of the school community.

This is a good book but not my first choice of reading.", "Irish author, Sally Rooney\u2019s second novel came to my attention when nominated for the Booker in 2018. Since then Normal People has won the Costa Book Award, An Post Irish Award, and nominated for many others. Quite a distinction for a wonderfully talented young author.Normal People is about Marianne and Connell, their secret friendship, and their on and off again relationship. They are two young people drawn to each other who drift apart at times, but always end up coming back to each other throughout their lives. It is an intimate, but sometimes painful look at two people from different backgrounds that don\u2019t really belong together. One comes from a loving home, where as the other lives in a cold and hateful environment. Rooney\u2019s novel is powerful and complex. It is not a romance or love story, but an in-depth character driven study. It\u2019s more about obsession and two flawed high school students that follow each other to Trinity College in Dublin. Normal People is unfiltered, emotional and direct. Marianne and Connell do well communicating in bed, but not elsewhere. Misunderstandings from poor communication make this novel what it is - tragic and full of sadness.The ending of the book is perfect. Rooney wraps up her novel as it should be. I am thankful that in my pursuit of reading the Booker Longlist that Normal People was included. Her first book, Conversation With Friends, is waiting on my Kindle...5 out of 5 stars", "Oooof. Alright - a disclaimer before I start. Normal People by Sally Rooney is superb. I\u2019m gonna gush about this one (warning to those in the splash zone!) and I honestly feel that the less you know about it, the better the experience will be for you. So, to those of you who\u2019re thinking of reading it, don\u2019t bother with any reviews about the book - just read it. It\u2019s a contemporary story about a boy and a girl who fall in love. That\u2019s all you need to know. And when you\u2019re done, come back and we can hi-five each other in joy over its excellence! \u2026Why did I begin with \u201cOooof\u201d? Because I genuinely feel like I\u2019ve been punched in the gut. Repeatedly. This is such an emotionally exhausting and draining read! Sally Rooney\u2019s created a remarkably compelling pair of characters in Marianne and Connell and I felt their love so intensely it was like I was experiencing it with them. Which makes it sound like a romance, and it has some of those elements, but if it\u2019s anything it\u2019s a classic Bildungsroman (just a fancy word for \u201ccoming of age\u201d story). Marianne is the awkward loner in high school, brainy but socially isolated. Connell is the good-looking popular boy, inexplicably drawn to Marianne - star football player falls for nerdy girl. The two begin seeing each other secretly - god, it sounds sooo fucking cheesy doesn\u2019t it? I promise you it\u2019s anything but. From there it\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions as the characters grow and develop. I loved it pure and simple. Here are some critiques to anyone who didn\u2019t enjoy the book: Marianne\u2019s brother Alan is a laughably one-dimensional villain. There\u2019s no plot (which is very typical of this type of story) - the story just starts and then ends. The occasional phrase feels hammy and clich\u00e9d (stuff like \u201cso few people have what we have\u201d). Connell is written as this genius but he does some super-dumb things - and if he is so brilliant, would he care so much what others thought of him? Also, given how unbelievably connected Connell and Marianne are on every conceivable level, the number of times they misunderstand one another seemingly purely for dramatic purposes could be seen as contrived as fuuuuck. And, though I know almost nothing about Rooney, it feels like a very autobiographical novel - most young writers tend to write about themselves to start with, after all. She\u2019s a young Irish woman who went to Trinity College, Dublin, on a scholarship, like Marianne, and the novel ends with the characters in their mid-20s, which is the same age I suspect Rooney was when she stopped writing this (she\u2019s now 27 years old). In that regard you could say it\u2019s somewhat unimaginative. Listen: none of that matters. I noticed those things and I didn\u2019t care. Because it\u2019s so well-written, so damn compelling, so enthralling and honest and\u2026 real. If I gave this anything less than the highest possible rating, I\u2019d be lying about how much I enjoyed this book. It\u2019s also impressive that she didn\u2019t shy away from writing the sex scenes given how tricky they are to write with most writers publicly embarrassing themselves. She\u2019s such a confident and skilful writer \u2013 already, at such a young age! - that she pulls them off admirably and, yes, sensuously. If you\u2019ve ever heard someone trying to convince someone else to start reading books, one of the points they\u2019ll make is that you get to live lives you never would. Most books do this on a superficial level but Normal People actually achieves this viscerally. This is one of those books that effortlessly draws you into it and lets you experience the intensity of Marianne and Connell\u2019s heart-achingly, tender, complex relationship in a totally believable way - it\u2019s powerful stuff. Truly, I felt more and more anxious as the book went on until I was actually dreading the end - this novel turned me into a wreck! The Guardian review, which drew me to this book in the first place, mentioned something like \u201cthis is a novel for and about the Millennial generation\u201d but it\u2019s not really. In a literal sense the characters and author are Millennials but besides that there\u2019s nothing about this book that makes it distinct for this specific time - it could easily be set at any point in the last 50 years and still work perfectly. I\u2019m not really sure what the book was trying to say - if anything - but it\u2019s left a deep impression regardless. Maybe that\u2019s it - the whole labelling of generations is a fruitless exercise in misnomers, we\u2019re all the same and love is a complicated, weird thing for all of us? Maybe it\u2019s trying to define what \u201cnormal\u201d is for this generation but isn\u2019t that something every generation goes through? And I\u2019m not exactly sure what conclusions Rooney comes up with could be uniquely ascribed to Millennials. I\u2019ll leave it with this because I\u2019m spent: Normal People isn\u2019t just the best novel of the year, or even the best novel of the last few years, but it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever read in my life. Maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for coming of age stories? W. Somerset Maugham\u2019s Of Human Bondage told a similar type of story that left me just as devastated - but in a good way (sort of). A beautiful powerhouse of quiet, extraordinarily potent sensations that indelibly captures an important part of the human experience, Normal People has made me an instant fan of Sally Rooney\u2019s - and thank you for writing it. ", "3.5 stars.Sally Rooney's upcoming novel \nNormal People\n almost felt like a puzzle, in that you didn't really know what you were truly getting until all of the pieces came together. Beautifully written although a little slow in its pacing, it's a novel full of deep emotions, which made it difficult to read at times.Connell and Marianne know each other from high school, although they pretend not to, plus his mother works as a cleaner for her family. Marianne is a bit of a laughing stock in school, mainly because she doesn't care what her classmates think of her. Connell is tremendously affected by what people think of him, so when a connection starts to grow between him and Marianne, and turns to something physical and even emotional, they keep it hidden, and he ignores her in school.\"At times he has the sensation that he and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronisation that it surprises them both. She tosses herself gracefully into the air, and each time, without knowing how he's going to do it, he catches her.\"Marianne feels so intensely for Connell, and she is willing to let him possess her completely. He can't explain his feelings for Marianne, except that she thinks so highly of him, but he continues to fear what his peers would think if they knew what was going on. He winds up treating her badly, leaving her to deal with her own emotional distress.One year later, both are studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Connell feels uneasy, no longer the popular fellow he was in high school, and has difficulty relating to his peers and fitting in. Marianne, on the other hand, is comfortable in this world, enjoying deep conversations about the political and economic issues facing society, and being looked at as an object of desire, not ridicule by her fellow students. No matter what other opportunities present themselves, the pair finds themselves drawn to each other once again, enjoying the way their interactions make them feel yet falling into the same patterns which cause friction.\"Marianne had a wildness that got into him for a while and made him feel that he was like her, that they had the same unnameable spiritual injury, and that neither of them could ever fit into the world. But he was never damaged like she was. She just made him feel that way.\"\nNormal People\n follows Marianne and Connell through their time at college, through different relationships and the periodic circling back to one another, whether solely for friendship or something else. Each chapter, with a few exceptions, takes place a few months after the last one. But Marianne's penchant for self-destruction and Connell's inability to cope with the emotional stresses he faces leave them both unsure what their relationship should be and could be, if anything.Marianne's feeling she is unworthy of being loved without abuse or mistreatment, and the way she is treated by her family, boyfriends, and others, is very difficult to read about at times. Connell's bouts with depression are also quite painful to read, so at times this book felt very heavy, and its pacing seemed to move much slower than I would have liked. And like many books which focus on relationships, at times I wanted to shake both characters to make them say the things they wanted to, to each other and other people in their lives.Despite the book's emotional turmoil, Rooney's writing is exceptional. There were so many passages beyond the two I've cited in this review that I read over and over again, marveling at her use of language and imagery. She definitely got me completely immersed in this book and these characters, even when things seemed particularly draining or moved slowly. \nNormal People\n is really affecting, and it will stick with me for a long time.NetGalley and Crown Publishing provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

The writing was good and some of the themes were interesting but I was rather bored by the selfabsorbed, clich\u00e9-characters: women who just want to 'get the man' and who always question their self-worth after a break-up, and men who are behaving as if they come straight out of a 'boys-will-be-boys'-movie. So 1950ies. And the ending is just plain cheesy. 2.5* (mainly because the writing was good).And not much has changed after the re-read in January 2019: Nope, I still don't get the hype...", "This book is amazing, kinetic, insightful, and fun - I'm writing a long-form review for Guernica about it (examining, partially, the spectrum of reactions on this site), so I can't say too much yet, but wow, I could not put this down. It feels ferociously of the moment, yes, but it also has a timelessness all its own. Cut through the hype. Time management is stellar (every new chapter is a time jump ahead), both perspectives are great (every chapter alternates between our two leads, with the attendant misunderstandings of a really good rom-com), and the characters behave like real people. Excellent supporting cast too, which is a rare treat. There are issues, sure, but this is a pleasure machine.", "How do two damaged people, who long for nothing more than to be \u201cnormal\u201d, navigate the intricacies of a relationship? This book tore my heart out and stomped on it, and I mean that in the best possible way.Marianne and Connell become acquainted when his mother is the housekeeper for her family. Marianne\u2019s family is wealthy, but she is the smart, nerdy, unattractive girl who is an outcast at school while Connell, also smart, is the popular jock. They enter into a relationship that he wants to keep secret. Marianne doesn\u2019t feel as if she deserves anything more than this and so accepts these terms. The relationship has its ups and downs and neither can communicate well with the other. Circumstances occur that drive them apart but their paths cross in college and they find their positions are reversed. Marianne is now the sophisticated, popular girl while Connell\u2019s lower socioeconomic status makes him feel unworthy. He is now the unpopular one who is the outsider.In the ensuing years, they drift in and out of each other\u2019s lives. As the reader, we are privy to their innermost thoughts and desires, their longings and their pain. We know their sensitivities, and what makes them tick. We learn details of their backgrounds and the resulting pain and hurt.  Sometimes the damage and the pain is just too deep to reveal oneself to another. It\u2019s better to bury it and deny it, to pretend to not care as a defense mechanism. The truth is they care very much, but they don\u2019t feel deserving of love and kindness. Such a person often turns to unhealthy ways of managing their pain. When I discovered one of Marianne\u2019s coping mechanisms it was devastating.\u201cDeep down she knows she is a bad personality, corrupted, wrong, and all her efforts to be right, to have the right opinions, to say the right things, these efforts only disguise what is buried inside her, the evil part of herself.\u201dOn seeing two friends happy together\u2026 \u201cIt gives Marianne a window into real happiness, though a window she cannot open herself or ever climb through.\u201dI loved the way the author portrayed these characters as so very flawed, but gave us the information we needed to understand them. There\u2019s so much pain in their young lives that it made my heart hurt.Connell\u2019s is just as broken:\u201che had just wanted to be normal, to conceal the parts of himself that he found shameful and confusing.\u201d\u201c\u2026internally he felt nothing. He was like a freezer item that had thawed too quickly on the outside and was melting everywhere, while the inside was still frozen solid.\u201dCan these two people ever find happiness? Not just with each other, but with life in general. My heart broke, then grew hopeful, and then broke again. I read the majority of this novel in one sitting. I could not tear myself away. The writing is gorgeous and I\u2019m in awe that someone so young has such insight into the human heart and can write in a way that delivers such an emotional punch.It\u2019s no secret that books that delve deep into a character\u2019s psyche are my favorite types of reads. They deliver all the emotions that makes for an unforgettable read. People who walk around with invisible scars that make them feel unworthy and \u2018less than\u2019 touch me deeply. The ending\u2026I don\u2019t see how it could have ended any other way. It isn\u2019t tied up in a neat bow but gives the reader much to ponder.Note there are no quotation marks which I usually find annoying and gimmicky, but in this case it worked and worked well. After a few pages I didn\u2019t even notice.Marialyce and I read and discussed this together. It\u2019s a book that begs to be discussed the minute you turn the last page.Many thanks to Netgalley for my copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. For our reviews on this and other duo reads please visit Marialyce\u2019s blog: https://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpres...", "I finished Normal People last night but had to think about it for a little while before writing this review, which is unusual for me. In summary: I really liked it! Marianne and Connell meet in high school, where Marianne is perceived by many as odd although she doesn\u2019t care about popularity or public opinion. She\u2019s from a wealthy family and bored by the obligations of school. Connell\u2019s mother, Lorraine, cleans Marianne\u2019s family\u2019s home. Connell is popular, athletic, and well-liked. Marianne and Connell are friendly though not necessarily \u201cfriends\u201d but this changes once they hook up. They both end up attending Trinity College in Dublin. It seems the roles have reversed as Marianne finds her place here and Connell feels isolated and somewhat adrift. The story is told in spurts of time periods (3 months later, 6 months later, 3 months later, etc.) detailing the progression and regression of the relationship between Marianne and Connell. Sometimes they\u2019re best friends, other times more, and sometimes more distant, cordial, but less than close. I found their relationship interesting \u2014 Both characters had dislikable moments, yet both were relatable in different ways. Was it the familiarity of the pendulum of feelings about one person in your formative early adult years, as you try to continue figuring out who you are? I\u2019m not sure, but I thoroughly enjoyed Normal People though I was nervous in anticipation of the ending, but found it to be very fitting. Highly recommend.", "I thought I\u2019d do the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge, even though it\u2019s just about winter here in Sherwood. But I think I\u2019ll get away with it, you never see any police around here from one year to the next. Anyway, standards really aren\u2019t what they were, I don\u2019t even think anyone would care. In the old days if you did a summer reading challenge in winter you\u2019d be out the door so fast your feet wouldn\u2019t touch the ground. But these days people have neck tattoos and name their children after brands of paint remover so you can get away with anything. When I looked at the categories of the reading challenge I had to ditch a couple \u2013 \u201cRead a Goodreads Choice Winner\u201d was one \u2013 I mean, sorry Goodreads, not to eat the hand that feeds you and all but those Choice Awards are not my cup of tea at all.

The category I\u2019m doing here is \u201cRead a \u2018most read\u2019 book\u201d so I consulted the list and I found a copy of one of these popular works in my local Oxfam, and Normal People it is. NOT THAT NORMALThis turned out to be a kind of romance but at least it was the unromantic modern version, where we follow a couple from school (she\u2019s rich and unpopular, he\u2019s working class and beloved by all) to university (where it\u2019s the other way round suddenly) and during this long peregrination they\u2019re on-and-off shagging and loving and BFFing and pinging from one thing to the other like pinballs whilst at the same time recoiling in horror from acknowledging the plain fact that they\u2019re made for each other, so they attempt and fail to have actual real boy/girlfriends and the real boy/girlfriends have no idea what\u2019s really going on so this golden couple of Marianne and Connell have a permanent status of IT\u2019S COMPLICATED. They have angst in their pangst.The short version of all that is to say that Normal People is the unfunny updated version of When Harry Met Sally or that it\u2019s like if Ross and Rachel had absolutely no sense of humour or any charm at all and were all strictly gloomsville I-am-suffering because life is suffering, woe is us, woe is all of us. THE MASOCHISM TANGOIn the middle of this wall to wall fraughtness and gnashing of laptops we get to find out that the lovely Marianne has a masochistic streak. When she\u2019s not with Connell she likes her boyfriends to beat her up.I think it\u2019s now possible to construct a rough and ready scale of female masochism using novels I happen to have read or movies seen.

I can\u2019t see O ever being beaten. THE WATER FROM THE TAP GOT WARMERThe soundtrack to Normal People I think would be a jarring mixture of Kraftwerk, Leonard Cohen and late Billie Holliday, when her voice was all hoarse and ruined. What Normal People does is to describe at length a hot mess of a relationship in cool, affectless sentences, some of which go way too far with their cool and affectlessnessThe outside door closes and Marianne re-enters the kitchen. She rinses her water glass and leaves it upside down on the draining board.Many pages laterThe water from the tap got warmer and Marianne put the plug in the sink and squeezed a little dish soap onto a sponge. And many pages laterMarianne drank a single cup of black coffee and ordered a croissant which she didn\u2019t finish. Connell had a large ham-and-cheese omelette with two slices of buttered toast, and tea with milk in it.Meanwhile, our tall handsome working class star student Connell suffers from a book-length inarticulacy that is distressing to witness. He\u2019s all \u201cthat was weird\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it\u201d, \u201cKind of\u201d and \u201cThat was weird\u201d.As regards the plot, there\u2019s not much to see here, it\u2019s really just beads on a string. One thing - I had a problem with Marianne\u2019s family, only a mother and a brother, but they both seem to hate her, for reasons never explained. I mean, give us a hint, Sally. Just a little hint. But you know what, I read this in two big gulps, it was weirdly compelling, similar to another much beloved and not that great campus novel The Secret History. So that\u2019s something. I read many novels that I find extremely putdownable and unpickupable. This was not one of those. SO, DID YOU LIKE IT?It\u2019s complicated. 2.5 stars.", "4 Emotional Heartrending Stars.Connell and Marianne. Two teens who are misfits, if you will. Drawn to each other in a way neither can explain. Throughout the years their forge a friendship, then a relationship of sorts, feeling the push and pull, which always remains the same. Neither satisfied, or ever getting what they want, yet both inexplicably drawn to the other. Always. Both complete the other in a way that no one else ever will. There were so many times while reading \u201cNormal People\u201d by Sally Rooney where I was overcome by emotion. For Marianne, who was mistreated in many ways, and for Connell, who couldn\u2019t always express himself. For both of them, as they suffered from depression and/or abuse, for which my heart broke time and again. I wanted more for the characters - I admit it! I wanted more for Marianne!! Connell too, perhaps. I sat with this novel for a long time before writing this review. The ending unnerved me. It left me unsettled. I thought, what?! That\u2019s it.. but then, after sitting with it, well, it made sense, it fit with the entirety of the novel, such as it was - with the brilliance of the writing. For that, I applaud Sally Rooney. For those of you who love literary fiction, this, my friends is the novel for you. Published on Goodreads on 10.12.19.", "I would give this 10 stars if I could. I probably just finished the best book of 2019.My God, what a book. So many thoughts and emotions are running through my head I don't even know where to begin. I could cry with relief that I had two people really impress upon me the need to read this book. To think! I almost let this go by and fall into the cavern that is my TBR pile. I cannot believe I almost missed out on the experience of what it was like to live with this book the past two days. I was so enthralled that I dreamt about it. My very subconscious absorbing how deeply Marianne and Connell's story touched me to the very core of my heart. Marianne and Connell's friendship begins in her kitchen. Connell comes from a working class, single-parent family whose mother is the housekeeper for Marianne's wealthy mother. While both intellectually gifted, they live in very different worlds. Connell is popular, athletic and the boy every girl wants to be with. Marianne is quiet, socially disinterested and the only talk of her at school is that of how weird she is and how she must be mentally ill. As we pick up later in their lives after a year of college, their roles have reversed. Suddenly Marianne is always with friends and is fending off suitors, while Connell is having a hard time finding his place and fitting in. Their chance encounter at a party leads them to years of on again-off again relations, although what always remains constant is their friendship and love for the other person.What Rooney accomplishes in 273 pages is a complete master class of the spectrum of emotions that are capable in the soul of these two, twenty-somethings. Always having been extremely emotional myself, I felt my heart ripped out of my chest several times through reading this book and then again repaired and replaced as their relationship re-balanced. It was so easy for me to slip back 15 years or so to when I was in college and going through very similar situations. The shy and tentative love that developed was so believeable it set off fireworks inside when that feeling was acknowledged and returned. Then when misunderstanding and miscommunication set off months of depression and loneliness in these characters, that felt so real to me, I thought I was back there myself. Each exquisitely written section jumped ahead just far enough to allow our feelings a reprieve, to only go back and find out what took place in the gap and only have our heart ripped out again. One last piece I want to touch on is something that nagged at me almost peripherally as a subplot to the relationship, which rightly was front and center. That of this really highlighting this generational talent. I've found even as I get older that my experience (in all avenues) that has come with age blinds me to the memory of what it was like being in my early 20s. Normal People, written by a millennial, is a story that shows the anguish, depth of character and emotional resilience of two people who feel anything but \"normal\". Both Marianne and Connell constantly try to find within each other and themselves, the comfort of surpassing that insecurity. The world we are slowly inheriting is not that of our childhood and though it is a secondary focus in their lives, both characters grapple with how to navigate all that they care about against the normal concerns of feeling like they belong to their respective peer groups. I felt it was an incredibly adult representation of two people who could be any age, just trying to figure out their lives against the backdrop of the world. It served as a great reminder not to be so dismissive of youth, because after all, wasn't I there once?There are a plethora of fantastic reviews and they are rightly deserved. If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and give this book a chance. With Normal People, Sally Rooney has cemented herself as an author that should be on everyone's must-buy list.Below are some of my favorite passages:\"Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression toward Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn't of any interest to her, which in a way it isn't. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter's frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks \"warmth,\" by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.\" (p. 68)\"It was true, Peggy and Jamie were not very good people; bad people even, who took joy in putting others down. Marianne fells aggrieved that she fell for it, aggrieved that she thought she had anything in common with them, that she'd participated in the commodity market they passed off as friendship. In school she had believed herself to be above such frank exchanges of social capital, but her college life indicated that if anyone in school had actually been willing to speak to her, she would would have behaved just as badly as anyone else. There is nothing superior about her at all.\" (p. 200-01)\"Somehow he was expressing more emotion that at any time in his life before, while simultaneously feeling less, feeling nothing.\" (p. 221)\"Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.\" (p. 232)\"Marianne wanted her life to mean something then, she wanted to stop all the violence committed by the strong against the weak, and she remembered a time several years ago when she had felt so intelligent and young and powerful that she almost could have achieved such a thing, and now she knew she wasn't at all powerful, and she would lie and die in the world of extreme violence against the innocent, and at most, she could help only a few people. It was so much harder to reconcile herself to the idea of helping a few, like she would rather help no one than do something so small and feeble, but that wasn't it either.

As this book ends up being so much more than the sum of its parts it's particularly difficult to summarize, but basically, it's a sort-of-love-story about Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up in small town Ireland together, who both move to Dublin for university in 2011.There isn't much going on in this book aside from Connell and Marianne's 'will they/won't they' relationship, but I wouldn't describe this as a romance novel as much as a novel about being human. Sally Rooney highlights with razor-sharp precision the oddities and intricacies that complicate interpersonal interactions, even between two people who love one another. This book is about miscommunication, but not miscommunication as a plot device; miscommunication as an intrinsic part of the human experience, naturally calling into question the possibility of truly knowing another person. Connell and Marianne's inability to open up to one another is so much bigger than these two individual characters; it's about gender roles and socioeconomic differences and power dynamics and social status and preconceived notions and projections and misinterpretations, and Rooney examines it all minutely through the lens of this one ill-fated sort-of-couple. She also has the uncanny ability to cut to the emotional core of a scene without sensationalizing, and I think that's what strikes me as the most accomplished element of this novel.I think this book is inevitably going to be underestimated by some because of its premise, and because of all the hyperbolic claims that Rooney is the definitive voice of her generation. But it's a deceptively clever book; it's perceptive where it could easily be vapid, it's clear-eyed where it could be melodramatic, and it has more intellectual and emotional depth than anything else I've read recently. A bit of an unconventional choice for the Booker longlist, but it fully earned its spot in my opinion, and I'd love to see it shortlisted.", "I'm late to the Normal People party but DAMNNNN! This book gave me all the feels. The good, the bad, and the ugly. This is the story of Connell and Marianne, and their relationship, as they navigate from high school and throughout college. The entire time I read this I was screaming in my head for these two just to be together and to stop screwing everything up....for me. Yes, you read that right, I felt like I had some personal stake in this relationship and that can only be attributed to Sally Rooney's writing. She made me become invested in these characters. They are both damaged people and yet I adored each of them immensely even when they were infuriating me. I alternated between wanting to hug them and smack them with each turn of the page. \n\"He\u2019s amused at himself, getting wrapped up in the drama of novels like that. It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him. One of his professors calls it \u201cthe pleasure of being touched by great art.\u201d\n And Sally Rooney touched my heart. This isn't a romance novel. This is a book about a relationship that is so real and authentic that I sometimes forgot that these weren't actual friends of mine. To say it struck a chord with me would be an understatement. 4 stars! ", "My true rating is somewhere between 2 and 5 stars.Geez, this one made me sad. I don't think it's supposed to make readers sad, but with me it is what it is. If these young people are normal, then God bless everybody. I mean the writing isn't even \"normal.\" This is a very talky book, but there is not a quotation mark to be found. It shocked me at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. But this isn't \"normal\" writing. Does that mean the author isn't quite sure about what \"normal\" means? I'd like to know.Connell and Marianne. We follow them from high school through to several years later as they dance around their relationship. They are seemingly on again and off again, but can never totally escape each other. I alternately loved them and was disgusted by them. I admired Marianne so much for the way she handles a lot of situations, but then off she goes, totally disrespecting herself, which really frustrated me. And Connell. What a sweet guy, until he reveals more of what a jerk he can be. So focused on other people's opinions. What a sad state of affairs and a quintessential example of being one's own worst enemy. And thinking about it, that goes for Marianne too. But they can't help what they think, so it's hard to not like them anyway. I think. I finished this two days ago. I usually write my reviews right away, but I didn't with this one because I couldn't figure out how I felt about it. I still don't, but the review must go on. I didn't always look forward to picking it up as I knew I would probably run into more sad commentary that would just make me want to shake these two. But then I have to admit I had to keep fervently flipping the pages to see what would happen. I had no idea how the author could tie this up at the end. Then she did. Sort of. My reaction? \"Okaaaaaay...\"So did I like it? Maybe. Will I remember it for a long time. Oh Yes! And for that it gets more stars than this review would suggest. And the flipping of the pages--that's a reason for stars too. And I read it in a very speedy (for me) three days--that definitely says something.Do I recommend it? It depends. Would I ever read it again? Hmmmm....So there you go. Read it or not. If you do, I will be eagerly awaiting your reaction. If you don't, oh well; but you might have missed a good one. Perhaps.", "Appearances might deceive. This much I have learned from Sally Rooney\u2019s latest novel. If you read its blurb you might fall under the false impression that this is just another story about first love with conventional characters: Connell, a popular boy in high school, and Marianne, a smart and introverted outcast with the added complication of different social backgrounds. Their secret connection occurs outside school when they meet at Marianne\u2019s house when Connell\u2019s mother finishes her shift as a cleaning lady there.I guess many readers might have stopped reading after that boneless introduction, but if you have persisted, I will try to offer compensation for that unappealing start.\u201cNormal People\u201d is a fascinating psychological portrait of the journey towards adulthood in this new generation where the battle between popularity and personal insecurity influences the decisions that will define the course of a life. This is a story of mutual fascination between two lost people who understand each other beyond what is being said. Curiously enough, what happens to the protagonists is mostly marked by the silences and misunderstandings in their conversations. This is precisely, in my opinion, what makes Rooney\u2019s novel outstanding. She has an incredible skill to capture the mental processes of the characters, the way they perceive reality and misinterpret it because of their lack of self-confidence. Through Sally Rooney\u2019s eyes, the reader can understand, even identify with inexcusable behavior, perverse reactions and even cringing responses in dialogues where fear of being rejected dominates the pace and the exact choice of words in the exchanges between the characters.Marianne\u2019s absence of self-defense mechanisms, her incomprehensible need to be physically humiliated in order to feel loved will offer Connell disproportionate power to do with Marianne what he pleases, and that will be his greatest challenge: to be mature enough to deal with such an excessive surrender and to discover his own capacity for selfless love.If I had to come up with some classics to compare this novel to, I\u2019d dare say it combines the romance of Jane Austen with the complexity of Flaubert\u2019s \u201cSentimental Education\u201d. The education in this case takes place in the years of college at Trinity, Dublin. A pity though that there is nothing in the book that evokes a bit of the setting, of my so adored Ireland and the misty moods that permeate the pebbled alleys of its ancient villages. I would have appreciated descriptive passages to frame the evolution of Connell and Marianne\u2019s relationship and provided a certain lyrical touch that I found missing in Rooney\u2019s style, although I admit she is consistent with the way she presents her characters: young, unsentimental and living in a globalized world. Nevertheless, this is a gripping novel, a bittersweet story that shows the reader the way sex and power shape us, how the desire to hurt and be hurt, to love and be loved are but the evolution of a long conversation\u2026 and the silences in between.

But Circe is a strange child\u2014not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power\u2014the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565909496l/35959740.jpg", "title": "Circe", "authors": "Madeline Miller", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe", "reviews": ["ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\u2728 Signed and personalized copies are available through Main Point Books!

Not only did I fall in love with this story, I predict that this will be the best book I\u2019ll read all year. This book is about healing and doing what it takes to come into your own. This book is about love; the love between lovers, the love of a mother, and the love you must find in yourself. This book proves why family of choice will always be greater than family of origin. This book is about magic, and how we can find it in ourselves if we look hard enough. This is a book about becoming the witch you\u2019ve always buried deep inside you. \n\n\u201cThey do not care if you are good. They barely care if you are wicked. The only thing that makes them listen is power.\u201d\n\nOkay, maybe I should start this review off with a somewhat personal story. I was very privileged to go a very good high school where I was able to study The Iliad and The Odyssey for a class my freshman year. And fourteen-year-old Melanie fell in love. To say I was obsessed was an understatement, and more and more my heart was filled with love for Odysseus, Athena, and a certain love affair with the witch-goddess Circe. (Beautiful art by Kevin Nichols) Even upon finishing that class, I still couldn\u2019t get enough of Homer\u2019s words. And to this day, The Iliad and The Odyssey are the only books that I collect many editions of. All my loved ones and family correlate these epic poems with me, and always bring me new editions from their travels, and give me gifts for special events and holidays the same way they do with Harry Potter. One of the most prized possession I own is an edition of The Odyssey that was given to me by someone who meant a lot to me, at a very important time in my life. And these two tomes will always be a big part of my identity, and I will always recognize that they not only shaped me as a reader, but they shaped me as a human being, too. So, when I found out that that Greek mythology retelling queen, Madeline Miller, was writing a book centered around Circe, I knew it was going to end up being one of my favorite books of all time. And it ended up being everything I wanted and more. I hate to throw around the word masterpiece, but if I had to pick a book to give that title to, I\u2019d pick Circe. \n\n\u201cOdysseus, son of Laertes, the great traveler, prince of wiles and tricks and a thousand ways. He showed me his scars, and in return he let me pretend that I had none.\u201d\n\nAnd even though Odysseus plays a huge role in this story, this book is Circe\u2019s and Circe\u2019s alone. We get to see her growing up in Oceanus, with her Titan sun god father Helios, and loveless nymph mother Perse, and her three more ambitious siblings, Ae\u00ebtes, Pasipha\u00eb, and Perses. We get to see her living her life of solitude, exiled on the island of Aiaia. We also get to see her make a few very important trips, that are very monumental in Greek mythos. But we get to see all of Circe, the broken parts, the healing parts, and the complete parts. We get to see her love, her loss, her discovery, her resolve, and her determination. We get to see her question what it means to be immortal, what it means to be a nymph in a world ruled by gods, and what it means to just live. Her journey is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read before, and probably unlike anything I will ever read again. I have no combination of words to express how much her life and her story means to me. But I promise, I\u2019m not the same person I was before reading this book.\n\n\u201c\u2026All my life had been murk and depths, but I was not a part of that dark water. I was a creature within it.\u201d\n\nThis is ultimately a story about how different the tales will always be told for a man. And how the ballads will always be sung for heroes, not heroines, even if a woman was truly behind all the success the man greedily reaped. How the light will always fall to vilify the woman and showcase her as a witch that needs to be tamed, a sorceress that needs to be subdued, or an enchantress that needs to be defeated. Women, no matter how much agency they carve out in any male dominated world, will always be a means to an end to further the achievements of man. Always. And Circe displays that at the forefront of this story. Circe is most well known for turning Odysseus\u2019s men into pigs when they come to her island in The Odyssey, but Madeline Miller does such a wonderful job weaving all this Greek mythology into a fully fleshed out, brand-new tale. She has created something so unique, yet so breathtakingly good, I think so many readers will find it impossible to put this new-spin of a story down. I was completely captivated and enthralled from the very first line to the very last line. This book just feels so authentic, I felt like I was in the ocean, on the island, and traveling right beside Circe throughout. And I never wanted to leave her side. \n\n\u201cIt was their favorite bitter joke: those who fight against prophecy only draw it more tightly around their throats.\u201d\n\nOverall, I understand that this is a book that is very targeted to me and my likes. Not only is this a character driven story, with a main protagonist being a character I\u2019ve been in love with for over a decade, but the writing was lyrical perfection. I\u2019m such a quote reader, and I swear I would have highlighted this entire book. This book is also so beautifully feminist that it makes me weep just thinking about the things Circe had to endure. And it showcases the unconditional love of found families, yet also between a mother and her child, while simultaneously abolishing the notion that blood is worth more than anything else in any world. This book heavily emphasizes that you will never be the mistakes that your parents have committed. The entire story is a love letter to love itself and reveals all the things we are willing to do in the name of it. And most importantly, this is a book about how we are truly only ever in charge of our own stories, even though our actions may change the fate for others around us. Please, pick this masterpiece up, and I hope it changes your life, too. Thank you, Madeline Miller, I will carry your Circe in my heart for the rest of my life. \n\n\u201cThat is one thing gods and mortals share: when we are young, we think ourselves the first to have each feeling in the world.\u201d\n\nTrigger/Content Warnings: Violence, gore, murder, torture, physical abuse, child abuse, thoughts of suicide, brief scene with cutting, graphic childbirth scenes, mention of bestiality, mention of incest, animal sacrifice, death of a sibling, death of a child, death of a loved one, death of an animal, rape, adultery, and war themes.

Circe is a book about... finding yourself. But god, \nit stands out so far from just that.\n Okay, to get started, I\u2019m just going to say it: \nMadeline Miller is one of the best writers of our time.\n She has such a way with words that it is absolutely impossible not to be engaged in her storytelling. The thing that brings this whole novel together is \nCirce\u2019s character.\n She is a woman who has done awful, evil things, and yet remains unfailingly human. She is lonely, and harsh, and hiding herself in sarcasm much of the time. And there is not a moment in this novel in which I didn\u2019t adore her. Madeline Miller does such an amazing job developing this character, weaving her thoughts into the narrative without manipulating you into feeling a certain way, keeping the narrative wide yet keeping it focused around Circe. Throughout this novel I developed such a deep level of admiration for both this author and this character, \nthis character I\u2019m sure will stay with me forever.\nThis novel is so interesting because at its core, it is an exploration of the voice of women in Greek mythology. Circe is a character we see nothing of in the narrative of Greek mythology, a character with seemingly evil intentions and little motivation \u2013 and all this despite showing up in several different stories. There\u2019s something supremely excellent about seeing a character like this who is essentially a plot device be given a story. I know I have a tendency to repeat the term \u201cnarrative agency\u201d but it beats repeating\u2014\nI absolutely love giving characters who have been given no agency the agency they deserve.\nI mean, everything about this book was just brilliant. I loved the myth interpretation: Penelope and Odysseus are both written perfectly, and seeing Jason basically get called an asshole while Medea stood on being young and morally grey and in love was so fantastic. And the exploration of gods vs. mortals is just brilliant: \nYou cannot know how frightened gods are of pain. There is nothing more foreign to them, and so nothing they ache more deeply to see.\nI loved the relationships \u2014 just as a special note, the relationship between Circe and Telegonus made me want to cry. I basically loved everything. I mean, I think you guys have gotten pretty easily why I liked this so much \u2014 \na morally-grey-character-driven retelling revolving around agency is basically my entire what-I-like bio.\n This did all the things I like and I want to reread it daily and hourly. I very well might. [I also want you all to know this book gave rise to my favorite update meme I have ever posted so thanks for that!!]Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtubebuddyread with my favorite Melanie \ud83d\udc9c", "\n\u201cWitches are not so delicate,\u201d I said.\nI absolutely loved this. If you enjoy Greek mythology, complex heroines, and a generous serving of adventure, bloodshed, betrayal, magic, and monsters - both literal and figurative - then hell, READ THIS BOOK.To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of Miller's The Song of Achilles when I read it a few years back. I'm not sure if that's because my tastes were different back then, or if it was just because the plot had more of a romantic focus than Circe. But, whatever the reason, I had no such problem with this book. I was absolutely captivated from start to finish.Circe is part beautifully-written literary fantasy and part divine Greek soap opera. This strange combination makes for a book that is extremely quotable, rich in description and detail, and also a pageturner. It moves seamlessly between the broader scope of the world and its many gods and monsters, to the more narrow focus of the nymph-turned-witch, Circe, and her daily life before and after she is exiled to the island Aeaea.Circe becomes a powerful witch, but the strength of her story is in all her relatable flaws and weaknesses. We follow her as a naive lesser nymph, longing to be accepted and loved. We stay with her as she believes the lies of others and, later, becomes hardened against such deceivers. Her compassion constantly battles with her rage. Understandably.There is some grim satisfaction to be gained as this woman who has been bullied, belittled and trod on her entire life slowly claws out some vengeance for herself. The pain she endures along the way means that her successes are bittersweet. In the end, Circe might be full of fantasy, backstabbing and murder, but it is first and foremost the story of one woman's life - through pain, love, desire, heartache and motherhood.\nI did not go easy to motherhood. I faced it as soldiers face their enemies, girded and braced, sword up against the coming blows. Yet all my preparations were not enough.\nOther Greek myths play out in the background - that of the Minotaur, and of Icarus, as well as many others - but it is Circe's personal tale that hits the hardest. I just hope we don't have to wait another seven years for Miller to write another novel like this.TW: Rape; graphic violence.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "Do you ever just get mad because you\u2019re spending your life paying rent and wishing you could take a break from the linear flow of time when you could have been a goddess living in an enchanted island that is only seen every ten years and is unreachable by men?

I do not have a single criticism for this fantastic piece of writing. I loved it!Circe chronicles the life of a lesser god. She is the daughter of the mighty God Helios, the living embodiment of the sun. She is born without any particular talents or powers. She exists in the shadows of her more developed brothers and sisters. She does not shine in such spectacular company. However, gifts come in many different forms and those with hidden talents are overlooked and devalued. More often than not quiet people are forgotten about and there worth ill-considered in all walks of existence. Circe\u2019s family never saw what she could become. Power is important, though sometimes having none teaches one a greater lesson: nothing is worth having unless it has been earned. As such Circe wills herself into power as she discovers her affinity for witchcraft, especially the art of transformation.Her family banish her from their company for her use of such a lowly art, and in doing so they set her free. She finds herself in her exile. On her island home she finds a paradise not a prison. She becomes one with nature and finds company with lions and wolves. Centuries pass, ages pass, and eventually some rather important characters come her way. She meets Hermes and Athena, Icarus and his farther Daedalus, and Odysseus, a man who changes her life and causes her to make a very powerful decision that leads this book into such an excellent conclusion.\n\u201cBut in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.\u201d \nCirce offers a huge story, a story that spans generations and includes many Greek heroes and gods. Such is the nature of godhood, of immortality. When life goes on forever many notable people cross one\u2019s path. And despite the huge number of famous characters here, none of it felt forced: it all slotted perfectly into Circe\u2019s life. There are so many myths that intertwine with Circe, like the story of the Minotaur and the fall of Icarus, though despite the famous nature of many of them they don\u2019t for a second overshadow her. She met Prometheus when she was young and decided that her life would not be the same as the other gods: she was going to be her own woman. And this is a book about her finding the most ultimate form of freedom. I could not recommend it more highly. I really liked The Song of Achilles though this surpassed it in every way. I really hope to see more from this author in the future.  Five fantastic stars Facebook| Twitter| Insta| Academia", "\nBruh my girl Circe really snapped.

What do you mean turn them into  swine? From her earliest application of her new found transformative skills it is suggested that what Circe turns her unfortunate guests into has more to do with their innermost nature than Circe\u2019s selection of a target form. (The strength of those flowers lay in their sap, which could transform any creature to its truest self.) Clearly her sty residents had an oinky predisposition. And I am sure that there are many who had started the transformation long before landing on her island.Whaddya call the large sty Circe filled with erstwhile men? A good start.Ok. You had to know this would be part of the deal for this review. So, now that I have gotten it out of my system, (it is out, right?) we can proceed.\nWhen I was born, the name for what I was did not exist.\nIt was a word that Barbara Bush might have had in mind when she described Geraldine Ferraro, her husband\u2019s opponent for the Vice Presidency, in 1984. \u201c\"I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich,'\" she said, later insisting that the word in question did not begin with a \u201cb,\u201d but a \u201cw.\u201d Sure, whatever. But in this case, I suppose both might apply. Circe is indeed the first witch in western literature. And many a sailing crew might have had unkind things to say about her. Madeline Miller - image from The TimesOur primary introduction to Circe (which we pronounce as Sir-Sea, and even Miller goes along with this, so people don\u2019t throw things at her. But for how it might be pronounced in Greek, you know, the proper way, you might check out this link. Put that down, there will be no throwing of things in this review!) was that wondrous classic of Western literature, The Odyssey. Given how many times this and its companion volume, The Iliad, have been reworked through the ages, it is no surprise that there have been many variations on the stories they told. Circe\u2019s story has seen its share of re-imaginings as well. But Miller tries to stick fairly close to the Homeric version. Be warned, though, some license was taken, and other sources inspired the work as well. But it is from Homer that we get the primary association we have with her name, the magical transmutation of men into pigs.George Romney's 1782 portrait of Emma Hamilton as Circe - image from wikipediaWe follow the life of our Ur-witch from birth to whatever. She did not start out with much by way of godly powers. Her mother, Perse, daughter of the sea-god Oceanos, was a nymph, and her father was Helios, the sun god. Despite the lofty position of Pop\u2019s place in things, Circe was just a nymph, on the low end of the godly powers scale. This did not help in the family to which she had been born. Not one of her parents\u2019 favorites, she was blessed with neither power nor beauty, had a very ungod-like human-level voice, and her sibs were not exactly the nicest. Kinda tough to keep up when daddy is the actual bloody sun. Years pass, and one day she comes across a mortal fisherman. He seems pretty nice, someone she can talk to. She\u2019d like to take it to the next stage, so she lays low, listens in on family gatherings, and picks up intel on substances that might be used to effect powerful and advantageous changes. She asks her grandmother, Tethys, (very Lannisterish wife AND SISTER to Oceanos) to transform him into a god for her, but Granny throws her out, alarmed when her granddaughter mentions this pharmakos stuff she had been looking into. Left to her own devices she tries this out on her bf, making him into his truest self. It does not end the way she\u2019d hoped. (Pearls before you-know-what.) Not the last bad experience she would have with a man. Levy\u2019s 1889 Circe - image from wikipediaHer relationships with men are actually not all bad. Daddy is singularly unfeeling, and can be pretty dim for such a bright bulb, and her brothers are far less than wonderful, but there is some good in her sibling connections as well. She has a warm interaction with a titan, Prometheus, which is a net positive. Later, she has an interesting relationship with Hermes, who is not to be trusted, but who offers some helpful guidance. And then there are the mortals, Daedalus (the master artist, the Michelangelo, the Leonardo da Vinci of his era), Jason, of Argonaut fame, Odysseus, who you may have heard of, and more. There were dark encounters as well, and thus the whole turning-men-into-pigs thing. Brewer's 1892 Circe and Her Swine - image from WikipediaMiller has had a passion for the classics since she was eight, when her mother read her the Iliad and began taking her to Egyptian and Greek exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It made her a nerdy classmate but was a boon when she got to college and was able to find peers who shared her love of the ancient tales. It was this passion that led her to write her first novel, The Song of Achilles, a reimagining of Achilles relationship with his lover, Patroclus, a delight of a book, a Times bestseller, and winner of the Orange prize. It took her ten years to write her first novel, about seven for this one and the gestation period for number three remains to be seen. She is weighing whether to base it on Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest or Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. If past is portent, it will be the latter, and should be ready by about 2025.Ulysses and Circe, Angelica Kauffmann, 1786. - image from Miller\u2019s siteThe central, driving force in the story is Circe becoming her fullest possible self. (I suppose one might say she made a silk purse from a sow\u2019s ear. I wouldn\u2019t, but some might.)\n This is the story of a woman finding her power and, as part of that, finding her voice. She starts out really unable to say what she thinks and by the end of the book, she\u2019s able to live life on her terms and say what she thinks and what she feels. - from the Bookriot interviewMost gods are awful sorts, vain, selfish, greedy, careless of the harm they do to others. Circe actually has better inclinations. For instance, when Prometheus is being tortured by the titans for the crime of giving fire to humans, Circe alone is kind to him, bringing him nectar, and talking with him when no one else offers him anything but anger and scorn. She is curious about mortals, and asks him about them, going so far as to cut herself to experience a bit of humanity. Carracci's c.\u20091590 Ulysses and Circe in the Farnese Palace - image from WikipediaLivestock comes in for some attention outside the sty. Turns out Circe\u2019s father has a thing for a well-turned fetlock, so maybe she comes by her affinity for animals of all sorts, albeit in a very different way, quite naturally. Her island is rich with diverse fauna, including some close companions most of us would flee. An early version of Doctor Doolittle?\n Scholars have debated whether Circe\u2019s pet lions are supposed to be transformed men, or merely tamed beasts. In my novel, I chose to make them actual animals, because I wanted to honor Circe\u2019s connection to Eastern and Anatolian goddesses like Cybele. Such goddesses also had power over fierce animals, and are known by the title Potnia Theron, Mistress of the Beasts.\n Not be confused with  The BeastmasterCirce and Odysseus. Allessandro Allori, 1560 - image from Miller\u2019s siteWhile she has her darker side (she does change her nymph love-rival Scylla into a beast of epic proportions, which gets her sent to her room, or in this case, island, and there is that pig thing again) she is also a welcoming hostess on her isle of exile, Aiaia. (Which sounds to me like the palindromic beginning of a lament, Aiaiaiaiaiaiaia, which might feel a bit more familiar with a minor transformation, to oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy). I mean, she runs a pretty nifty BnB, with free-roaming wild animals, of both the barnyard and terrifying sort, a steady flow of wayward nymphs sent there by desperate parents in hopes that Circe might transform them into less troublesome progeny, a table with a seemingly bottomless supply of food and drink. And she is more than willing to offer special services to world-class mortals, among others. I mean, after that little misunderstanding with Odysseus about his men, (Pigs? What pigs? What could you possibly mean? Oh, you mean those pigs. Oopsy. How careless of me.) she not only invites everyone to stay for a prolonged vacay, but shacks up with the peripatetic one, offers him instructions on reaching the underworld, suggests ways to get past Scylla and Charybdis, and probably packs bag lunches for him and his crew. She is not all bad. Barker's 1889 Circe - image from WikipediaCirce struggles with the mortals-vs-immortals tension. Her mortal voice makes her less frightening to the short-lived ones, allowing her to establish actual relationships with them that a more boombox-voice-level deity might not be able to manage. Of course, it is still quite limiting that even the youngest of her mortal love interests would wither and die while she remained the same age pretty much forever. Knowing that you will see any man you love die is a definite limiting factor. Yet, she manages. She certainly recognizes what a psycho crew the immortals are, even her immediate family, and respects that mortals who gain fame do so by the sweat of their brow or extreme cunning, (even if it is to dark purpose) not their questionable godly DNA. Reinforcing this is her front row seat to the real-housewives tension between the erstwhile global rulers, the Titans, and the relatively new champions of everything there is, the Olympians. I mean, perpetual torture, thunderbolts, ongoing seditious plots, the nurturing of monsters, wholesale slaughter of mortals? She knows a thing or two, because she\u2019s seen a thing or two.\n My thoughts about [Circe as caregiver] really start with the gods, who in Greek myth are horrendous creatures. Selfish, totally invested only in their own desires, and unable to really care for anyone but themselves. Circe has this impulse from the beginning to care for other people. She has this initial encounter with Prometheus where she comes across another god who seems to understand that and also who triggers that impulse in her. I wanted to write about what it\u2019s like when you to want to try to be a good person, but you have absolutely no models for that. How do you construct a moral view coming from a completely immoral family? - from Bookriot interviewCirce Offering the Cup to Odysseus \u2013 by John William Waterhouse \u2013 1891 - image from WikimediaOf course, there is a pretty straight line between the sort of MCP hogwash Circe had to endure in the wayback and recent events that have been getting so much attention of late \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to write Circe\u2019s story in a modern way\u2026 I was just trying to be true to her experience in the ancient world.\u201d\u201cIt was a very eerie experience. I would put the book away and check the news. The top story was literally the same issue I had just been writing about \u2014 sexual assault, abuse, men refusing to allow women to have any power ... I was drawn to the mystery of her character \u2014 why is she turning men into pigs?\u201d \u2013 from The Times interviewThere are plenty of classical connections peppered throughout Circe\u2019s tale. Jason and Medea (niece) pop by for a spell. She is summoned to assist in the birthing of the minotaur (nephew) to her seriously nasty sister. She is part of Scylla\u2019s origin story, interacts with Prometheus (cousin), gives shit to Athena, even heads into the briny deep to take a meeting with a huge sea creature (no, not the Kraaken). Hangs with Penelope (her bf\u2019s wife) and Telemachus (bf\u2019s son), and spends a lot of time with Hermes. She definitely had a life, many even, particularly for someone who was ostracized to live on an island.\nFor Circe, I would say the Odyssey was my primary touch-stone in the sense that that\u2019s where I started building the character. I take character clues directly from Homer\u2019s text, both large and small. I mentioned her mortal-like voice. The lions. The pigs. And then when I get to the Odysseus episode in the book, I follow Homer obviously very closely\u2026 - from the BookRiot interview\"Circea\", #38 in Boccaccio's c.\u20091365 De Claris Mulieribus, a catalogue of famous women, from a 1474 edition - image from wikipedia\n In terms of sources, I used texts from all over the ancient world and a few from the more modern world as well. For Circe herself, I drew inspiration from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses and Apollonius of Rhodes\u2019 Argonautica, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid,\u00a0the lost epic Telegony (which survives only in summary)\u00a0and myths of the Anatolian goddess Cybele. For other characters, I was inspired by\u00a0the Iliad, of course, the tragedies (specifically the Oresteia, Medea and Philoctetes), Vergil\u2019s Aeneid again, Tennyson\u2019s Ulysses\u00a0and Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida. Alert readers may note a few small pieces of Shakespeare\u2019s Ulysses in my Odysseus! - from Refinery29 interviewCirce \u2013 by Lorenzo Garbieri - image From Maicar Greek Mythology LinkMadeline Miller\u2019s Circe is not a lovelorn, lonely heart desperate for connection in her isolation, but a multi-faceted character (not actually a human being, though), with inner seams of the dark and light sort, with family issues that might seem familiar in feel, if not in external content, with sins on her soul, but a desire to do good, and with a curiosity about the world. She may not have been the brightest light in the house of Helios, but she glowed with an inner strength, a capacity for mercy, an appreciation for genius, beauty and talent, and a fondness for pork. This is the epic story of a life lived to the fullest. Circe is an explorer, a lover, a destroyer, and can be a very angry goddess. This transformative figure is our doorway to a very accessible look at the Greek tales which lie at the root of so much of our culture. If you have a decent grounding in western mythology this will offer a delightful refresher. If you do not, it can offer a delightful introduction, and will no doubt spark a desire to root about for more. Madeline Miller may not have a wand with special powers, or transmogrifying potions at her command, but she demonstrates here a power to transform mere readers into fans. Circe is a fabulous read!

A reinterpretation, on the other hand, gives an author creative license to weave a uniquely extravagant and fantastical story ( Now I Rise did it perfectly) and perhaps one in which a lowly nymph attains great powers, transforms into a formidable sorceress who then proceeds to defy and defeat gods. But, I digress.If Miller's ultimate goal is to introduce Greek mythology to a new generation of readers, then, I think she succeeded. However, that's ALL she achieved.This story about an inferior but immortal nymph called, Circe, who is a progeny of not one but TWO Titans -Helios and Oceanus- is decidedly underwhelming, trite, and overwrought with both too many characters yet very little story progression. Presumedly, the author had a checklist of events (and characters) that simply had to make an appearance in the story, even if the tangent was superfluous and unrelated:Prometheus, and the banishment. CheckScylla, the six-headed monster. CheckPasiphae, Daedalus, the Bull of Poseidon, and the horror that was Minotaur. CheckLet's not forget, Odyssey.And HermesAnd AthenaAnd many others who (please listen closely) WERE NOT REQUIRED TO MOVE THIS STORY FORWARD. Think I'm making this up? Well, let's see what the story's about shall we?1. Circe is so dull and uninteresting that2. Pretty much everyone ignores her; that is, until... 3. She uses her magic to turn Scylla into the six-headed monster. 4. Consequently, she's exiled to an island5. Where she at times turned unsavoury sailors into pigs6. Eventually leaving the island only after having lived there for centuries.7. The end.All in all, I think if you're new to mythology then this is for you; but even then I'd recommend reading Greek Mythology: A Captivating Guide to the Ancient Gods, Goddesses, Heroes, and Monsters instead.", "4.45/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3a\u201dWitches are not so delicate\u201d.Witches are raw power. And raw power through its definition is not delicate.Being honest right now, I have never been a huge fan of Greek mythology. I used to be obsessed with Egyptian mythology and fascinated by the Celtic one. But Greek mythology seemed all Greek to me (pun intended!). Not because it was unattractive, but just because I never understood it properly. I felt like it was a never-ending tale, too elaborate for my capacity of understanding. But this book written by Madeline Miller, Circe, helped the eyes of my mind flush open with understanding and for this I am thankful. Circe is introduced to us as a nobody. She is neither a full Goddess, in the true meaning of the concept, nor a mudblooded mortal. She is a Goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sun, the Titan Helios, and the beautiful nymph Perse, but the mundanity of her voice and the inutility of her presence made her a lesser Goddess in other Gods' point of view, even lesser than universally considered. She is an outcast even in her own family and as hard as she wants to change this, she\u2019s bound by unseen powers not to (Fates, duh!).The book expands some universal and social ideas: the road of an outcast hero, searching for love in a loveless life, feminist actions abnormal for the collective mentality of the time, vengeance and forgiveness. So many more.Starting with the road of an outcast hero, all is there to say is if you are not outcasted, then you don\u2019t suffer and if you don\u2019t suffer you have no drive to make something worth out of your life. In this case, an infinite, immortal life. Circe\u2019s exile on the isle of Aiaia makes her realise the infinite power that she possesses within her and everywhere around her. It all starts with a plant. It all ends with the same plant.Pharmaka is associated in the book with witchcraft. The power of the herbs to heal is magical. In my native language, Romanian, there is a word similar to the word pharmaka and its meaning from the book. We say farmece, witchery spells. When someone does farmece to you, that person casts an unseen and unfelt spell over you (both metaphorically and practically speaking). Circe\u2019s power is to tame the so-feared pharmaka and use it without being afraid. Circe is a powerful individual, but she gains this power from her wisdom, the wisdom of time: \u201d\u201dYou are wise\u201d, he said. \u201dIf it is so\u201d, I said, \u201dit is only because I have been a fool enough for a hundred lifetimes\u201d\u201d. She is a free spirit and she has her father\u2019s roots of pride. She is her own master and she doesn\u2019s agree with the ancient etiquettes, sung by bards and stuck for eternity in people\u2019s minds: \u201eHumbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be no story unless we crawl and weep\u201d. This shows the power of freedom she raised in herself.Circe is powerful, yes. Circe is unique. Circe is herself. She gives us a valuable lesson on how to live free and how to live sufficiently. She is a figure of self-respect and self-care and she says, with unspoken words, that if you want to live happily, you have to live true to yourself. And as to paraphrase a quote from the book as my own strong impression of Circe, however gold she shines, do not forget her fire.", "OH.MY. GOODNESS. WHY? WHY? And WHYYYYY did I wait too long to read this! BIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP(Right now I\u2019m calling myself so nasty names! If I write them down, I\u2019m sure my goodreads page will be closed \uf04a So after the bippp tone I\u2019m coming back!)I came back. Still pissed off myself. So what do we have? I don\u2019t want to fill this page to describe how I devoured each page of it and how I literally fell in love with this book because words are not enough for me! Anything I write here will not be enough to show my adoration. They will be just mediocre fan woman expressions which are not meaningful enough to express my feelings. So I\u2019m not gonna waste your time with my unnecessarily wordy review and irritate your eyes. No words can define this book. PERIOD!This is fantastic retelling of Greek mythology and rare combination of magic, backstabbing characters, bloodshed, intrigue, power games. I\u2019m so happy for my time management to create extra time to read this precious gem! (Working, reading, drinking, watching and irritating your husband takes too much time so I reduce my sleep time and now I got so many offers from Walking Dead casting calls to be their long term zombie extra!)My top ten reads exceeded number ten, I have to formulate another plan to categorize my all time favorite books but I\u2019m so sure this book already earned its place at the top of my list. I should reread it after a few months later.I highly recommend you to listen to its audiobook. Perdita Weeks achieved a dreamy job . She perfectly captured the soul of the book and expressed this soul with her lyrical, effective voice that penetrates into our hearts.", "\n When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist.\nWhere do I even begin? This was one of the most amazing, beautiful, intricate, captivating books I have had the pleasure of reading in my entire life. I have been a bookworm since I was barely walking, and yet this book, this gorgeous retelling, has impacted me so profoundly that I genuinely do not know if I will ever be entirely the same.\nIt is a common saying that women are delicate creatures\u2014flowers, eggs, anything that may be crushed in a moment\u2019s carelessness. If I had ever believed it, I no longer did.\nAs a child, I loved Greek mythology, and though I lost some of that knowledge through recent years, when I heard that this story was releasing, I knew I just had to read it. I thought it was going to be the story from Circe\u2019s point of view, but ultimately, I expected it to revolve around Odysseus; I had no idea that I was in for such a treat, though, as he is only a small portion of the immortal Circe\u2019s life. This isn\u2019t a retelling, it\u2019s an origin story, a history, a tale of centuries\u2019 worth of loves and losses, griefs and triumphs.\nThe thought was this: that all my life had been murk and depths, but I was not a part of that dark water. I was a creature within it.\nFrom the very start, we see that Circe is so vastly set apart from her fellow gods and goddesses; as a nymph with the reedy voice of a mortal, she is told she is wholly useless, but it\u2019s evident from the beginning that she is this brilliant, clever, strong woman: a force to be reckoned with in every way. I knew I would love her, but I couldn\u2019t have predicted how fast or hard I would find myself rooting for her to succeed.\n But of course I could not die. I would live on, through each scalding moment to the next. This is the grief that makes our kind choose to be stones and trees rather than flesh.\nOf course, Circe\u2019s exile on the isle of Aiaia is bound to be an unhappy story, and that\u2019s a common thread throughout Circe: you always know something miserable or painful is on its way, but the moments in between those travesties, and the ways Circe handles the hand of cards life has dealt her, makes it so incredibly worth the ache. Perhaps the greatest thing about watching her struggle is how much relatability it lends to her character; despite being a goddess, an immortal, and a witch, Circe at her core is a spurned woman who has lived too long under the heels of spiteful, power-hungry men, and a wicked society that values beauty over strength.\n But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.\nOf course, Circe\u2019s tale is not entirely a desolate one, but her joys are often her curses, as she loves mortals and sees in them the same potential that cursed Prometheus to his rock. Throughout her life, we get to see relationships come and go, and I was enthralled by how incredibly sex-positive and sure of herself she remains. Rather than selling herself away to the highest bidder, Circe\u2019s primary focus is to never let her pursuit of pleasures and companionship win out over her need to be her own person.\n \u201cIt is not fair,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot bear it.\u201d\u201cThose are two different things,\u201d my grandmother said.\nIt was so enjoyable to watch the different characters cycle in and out of her memories, whether it was Daedalus and his loom, or Hermes and his messages and antics, or\u2014of course\u2014Odysseus, who we saw in a much more realistic light, as Circe portrayed an image of him that was far less heroic or noble than many of the legends would have one believe. There are even mentions of Patroclus and Achilles, and what became of them, though I was pleased to find that prior knowledge of The Song of Achilles was not at all necessary to fully enjoy this book.\n I would look at him and feel a love so sharp it seemed my flesh lay open. I made a list of all the things I would do for him. Scald off my skin. Tear out my eyes. Walk my feet to bones, if only he would be happy and well.\nOf all the things Madeline\u2019s writing had to offer me, though, the one that meant the most to me was wholly unexpected: the perfect, beautiful depiction of motherhood through Circe\u2019s relationship with her son. As a mother to a wild little boy of my own, I related to so many of her thoughts and fears, but most of all, to the utter authenticity of the love she describes for him. It consumes her entirely\u2014for better or for worse\u2014and her need to protect him holds such ferocity that she worries it will destroy her at times. Many of the thoughts she held for him gave me chills or brought tears to my eye, and throughout it all, I just kept thinking that I had never felt like motherhood had been so perfectly described as it is in this book.\n You threw me to the crows, but it turns out I prefer them to you.\nTruly, I could gush for days, but I\u2019m going to cut myself off here and just ask you to please, please pick up a copy of this beautiful book. I sound like a broken record, but it meant so much to me, and has earned such a warm place in my heart that I know I will reread it over and over in the coming years. Whether you are a mother, or a lover of Greek mythology, or just a bookworm looking for a story that will capture you so wholly, you\u2019ll never want to leave its embrace\u2014this book is flawless, utter perfection, and I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough.All quotes come from an unfinished ARC and may not match the finished release.

Everywhere you turn, you see that magnificent cover (honestly, that cover work is DIVINE and I\u2019ve had the MOST fun photographing it for the Bookstagram). Twitter and Instagram are as we speak packed with Circe references and Miller interviews and, within all of that, Circe has found itself wrapped in all of the fluff and buildup and publicity of a typical ultra-hyped, big-named publisher release. Let\u2019s be serious\u2014most of us LOVE these kinds of releases and all the hysteria involved, even if we shy away from actually reading the hyped release itself. It can be a book lover\u2019s dream--a book with all the fanfare of a blockbuster, silver screen release. I, too, was swept up in the craze, yet another smash hit from the publisher who brought us fan favorites like Twilight and whom I once interned for in London. But, in the end, I couldn\u2019t ride the Circe wave all the way through. Let\u2019s get one thing clear from the very start: Madeline Miller\u2019s follow up to The Song of Achilles is an epic in the years spanned but not necessarily in the execution. To me, it read far more like a long story than an \u201cepic.\u201d When I think of that four-lettered word, I think of a novel that\u2019s monumental and moving. I think of The Odyssey and sweeping sagas like A Song of Ice and Fire, even novels that are gripping and complex, long and treacherous as a Hajj like A Little Life. But Circe did not touch me in that way. In fact, there were moments\u2014those times when the novel resorted to recounting the tales of the mythology we all know so well rather than putting the reader in the moment of these tales\u2014where I was bored to skimming. In Circe, pages upon pages passed of one character telling another a \u201cstory\u201d of others\u2019 happenings, travels and wars: Telemachus telling Circe about Odysseus, Circe recounting the story of Hermes, and on and on. Who wants to hear second- and third-hand about the chronicles of these larger-than-life names within a novel that calls itself an \u201cepic?\u201d I\u2019d rather feel and live the stories of these mortals and gods alike. Wouldn\u2019t you?Circe\u2019s life is a true saga, and Miller\u2019s research and background in the Classics shines through in this novel and serves her well. But, there are gaps between the breadth and notoriety of the mythology she incorporated here and the skill with which the novel was actually written. There is only so far that building a modern-day epic on the backs of known names and legends could go; Miller needed to take us the rest of the way to make Circe a contemporary wonder, to make this a saga all her own. This novel didn\u2019t quite make it across that bridge for me.Circe offered up a world full of color, a world of eternal life and leviathans, of clashing gods and witchcraft, all while tying in mythological tales that\u2019ve been handed down for ages. Perhaps it\u2019s only fitting, in that case, that it was overwrought with linguistic hyperbole\u2014The sound was a piercing chaos, like a thousand dogs howling at once\u2026She beat the cliff-side, howling her frustration. This novel was full of both drama and melodrama, only one of which is necessary for a sweeping epic. Yet, I had to appreciate the scale of story Miller told and the breadth of her knowledge in the Classics. Circe was a great story for sure, but I was never fully moved by how it was told. 3.5 stars.*** FOLLOW ME HERE:Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Get a Copy of My Book | Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me ", "\u201dIt was true what Hermes said. Every moment mortals died, by shipwreck and sword, by wild beasts and wild men, by illness, neglect, and age. It was their fate, as Prometheus had told me, the story that they all shared. No matter how vivid they were in life, no matter how brilliant, no matter the wonders they made, they came to dust and smoke. Meanwhile every petty and useless god would go on sucking down the bright air until the stars went dark.\u201d\n\nSculpture by Nicolas-S\u00e9bastien Adam in the Louvre.Meeting Prometheus in chains, very briefly, before he was taken to the mountain side to begin his punishment had a profound impact on Circe. He had given man fire, and in the process had angered the Gods. He was condemned by Zeus to have an eagle rip his liver from his body each day and eat it over and over again for all eternity. Mortals paid attention to the Gods more when they experienced more suffering. Fire reduced their offerings to the Gods. One might say that fire made them need the Gods less. Gods are fickle, childish creatures in need of constant reassurance. Circe was a daughter of Helios. \u201dAt my father\u2019s feet, the whole world was made of gold. The light came from everywhere at once, his yellow skin, his lambent eyes, the bronze flashing of his hair. His flesh was hot as a brazier, and I pressed as close as he would let me, like a lizard to noonday rocks. My aunt had said that some of the lesser gods could scarcely bear to look at him, but I was his daughter and blood, and I stared at his face so long that when I looked away it was pressed upon my vision still, glowing from the floor, the shining walls and inlaid tables, even my own skin.\u201dShe was the oldest daughter of the nymph Perse, and she was quickly followed by three siblings. When Zeus discovered they were all witches, he ordered Helios to slake his lust elsewhere. Maybe that was when Helios started turning himself into a bull and fucking his herd of precious cows. I\u2019m not sure if that was bestiality or if it deserved some new moniker to describe such perversity. \n\n\n\n\nPainting of Circe by Joseph Herrin\nCirce could never win the approval of her father because she was simply not as beautiful as she should be. Her voice was too thin, like a mortals, and her chin was too sharply made. When I looked at a picture of the Roosevelt family with all those attractive features, broad shoulders, and waspish waists, Eleanor Roosevelt stood out. She was Circe amongst all that beauty. In a normal family, attractive attributes could be noticed about Eleanor, but standing in the midst of the Roosevelts she was a flower with too few petals. Circe\u2019s siblings and cousins made her life a godly hell. They lived forever, and spite and vindictiveness were the slings and arrows of idle hands. She was lonely and made more lonely by the fact that no God would marry her, and mortals were simply not good enough for the daughter of Helios. She was discovering that she had powers. The very witchcraft that made the Gods shift uneasily in their thrones. She could transform an iris into a rose or a bee into a mouse. Then she met the mortal fisherman Glaucos. What she does to him confirmed all the fears that the Olympians had trembled over before. Her powers were a wellspring not yet beginning to geyser. Oh, and she turned the bitchy Scylla into a more representative version of herself. *Shudder*.Circe was banished to the island of Aiaia. *Sigh*. Perpetually misunderstood. I liked the way Madeline Miller tied in Circe\u2019s encounter with Prometheus, who sacrificed eternal torment for humanity, and what would turn out to be her lifetime fascination with mortals. Chicks dig scars, and Circe was no exception. After growing up with Gods whose skin, despite what hazards are encountered, remained unblemished, those scars on mortals were fascinating to her because they told the story of their lives in every livid slash and puncture. They might have worn their scars on their skin, but Circe bore hers on her soul. She wanted to help mortals, but found that usually when she tried to help, she made things worse. Not that there weren\u2019t bobbles in her relationship with mortals. After all, she did spend many years turning them into pigs, but then she was only bringing to light the least attractive part of their inner selves. She may have loved the mortal Odysseus the most, which brought her into conflict with: \u201dShe struck the room, tall and straight and sudden-white, a talon of lightning in the midnight sky. Her horse-hair helmet brushed the ceiling. Her mirror armor threw off sparks. The spear in her hand was long and thin, its keen edge limned in firelight. She was burning certainty, and before her all the shuffling and strained dross of the world must shrink away. Zeus\u2019 bright and favorite child, Athena.\u201d\n\nOdysseusOdysseus might have been the cleverest man of his generation, but Circe would have had to be even more clever as she harnessed what power she had to outwit a God that wished to have Odysseus at all cost, but also wished to bring harm to Circe\u2019s son, as well. A wonderful, reimagining of an ancient tale that was deftly brought to life by the assured, clear, precise writing style of a gifted writer and researcher. Don\u2019t tarry any longer. Experience the pleasure of epic triumph and tragedy spun in the threads of Daedalus\u2019s loom and wrapped in the magic that only Circe could conjure. If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten", "It is with immense regret and massive trepidation that I must say...I don\u2019t really get the hype.I really and truly don\u2019t. Why do you guys like this book so much? I am going to go through one potentially good thing by one ultimately disappointing thing and see if any of them click.1) Because it\u2019s a cool retelling?This is why I was excited for this, as someone who loves retellings. Recycled plots? Old-timey magic and Revenge and mean dads and royalty and dashed love stories that make women turn witchy? Sign me the hell up! But this wasn\u2019t really a retelling. It felt like if I were like \u201cI\u2019m going to rewrite American history, but from the perspective of some random chick who happened to be there for/sexually involved in a bunch of it.\u201d It didn\u2019t feel like one cohesive story at all. It felt like me writing a series of vignettes about a woman who had a crush on multiple founding fathers.2) Did you all like Percy Jackson?Is this Percy Jackson for the now-kind-of-grown-ups who once read Percy Jackson? Were you all the weird 11-year-olds who thought they were Greek mythology professors because they read about Logan Lerman\u2019s quirky sea-based summer camp misadventures? (Sorry I mentioned the movie. I know you guys hate that.) I read those books in elementary school, too, but even then I was extremely cool and quirky and unique and had tons of unpopular opinions and wasn\u2019t a big fan. So maybe it\u2019s that?3) Let\u2019s talk about Greek mythology except with one woman instead of a bunch of men?This is another reason I was excited about this, because I cannot think of a single instance in which a single witchy woman is not a million jillion times better than 100 interchangeable White Men Of History Or Fake Magic History. Well, now I can think of a single instance. If that woman spends the whole book basically on one island, even if that island is near monsters, even if that woman gets the occasional visit from a minor god or two, that is so much more boring. Because even with some significant editorializing, that woman is still witnessing maybe 7% of what\u2019s going down. And it\u2019s not really the fun 7%.4) Let\u2019s talk about Greek mythology except make it feminist and take out the girl hate?Another thing that I was excited about and then all of the excitement was brutally eked out of my soul over the course of like 400 hours of listening or however long this book was. Circe f*cks a married man or two in this book, and uh. Last time I checked...not the most feminist? Also, she\u2019s not exactly awesome to the spouses of these dudes. Double also, I feel like Penelope (Odysseus\u2019 wife) was a pretty blank slate and could\u2019ve been made into a real badass. Instead she, like so much of this book, was boring as hell.5) Because there\u2019s a badass female protagonist?This was like the single biggest selling point to me, and therefore THE MOST WRENCHING DISAPPOINTMENT. I truly feel -- and maybe I\u2019m the only one who feels this way -- like this was not so much a badass female protagonist as a woman who spends an (immortal, neverending) lifetime with a series of men. I did not want a series of romances. I wanted a badass, vengeful woman with witchy magical powers. Bottom line:What I wanted: Feminism! Mythology! Retelling! Badass cool protagonist!What I got: Boring. Island. More island. ----------currently-reading updatesme: ok time to write an essay!this traitor book: or - and here me out on this one - you could not do that and read insteadme: hm...compelling", "\nIf you like mythology, you need to read this book!Personally it's not even something I'm a fan of but I couldn't put this... audiobook down.

Consider the practicalities. By the time we learn their names, they are dead. They must be meteors indeed to catch our attention. The merely good: you are dust to us.\"I thought long and hard what to write about \u201cCirce\u201d but when it comes down to it the first words that always pop into my mind are: \u201cI loved this so damn much!!!\u201d *lol* Which is neither especially eloquent nor particularly significant. So what to do? How to describe my love for this book in words that would do this masterpiece (and yes, in my opinion it truly is a masterpiece) justice? \u201dI felt myself tremble, but I would not let him see it. Great gods smell fear like sharks smell blood, and they will devour you for it just the same.\u201dI guess I might start with what it is not. \u201cCirce\u201d is definitely not like \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d! To be honest those books couldn\u2019t have been any more different even if they tried. Whilst the main topics of \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d were the Trojan War and the undying love *weeps* between Patroclus and Achilles the major themes in \u201cCirce\u201d were her solitary life in exile and her encounter with Odysseus. This setting alone makes for an entirely different story and sets a completely different pace. The tale of Circe is slow and unfolds over time, the many centuries that pass away giving the reader not only a good sense of the change of the world but also an insight to our heroine\u2019s lonely life. Just like the love between Patroclus and Achilles was almost tangible in every single page from \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d Circe\u2019s solitude is palpable in every written line. \u201dI had no right to claim him, I knew it. But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.\u201dThe remarkable thing about her is that she didn\u2019t let it get her down. She might have been in exile and shunned by her family but she never got bitter because of it. Quite the contrary. She took what she had and changed it according to her needs and she adapted to her new life and made the best out of it. And even more important, she defied the gods by doing so. It might have been small gestures and little actions but with every breath she took she refused to give them any satisfaction. Circe was a strong-willed, skilled and formidable woman and I couldn\u2019t help but love her for it! \u201dWe lit no tapers. The room was dark and warm from the day's heat. Shadows draped the bed. No frogs sounded, no birds called. It was as if we had found the still heart of the universe. Nothing moved except for us.\"Despite her bravery and strong will it\u2019s undeniable that she was a very lonely woman though. This however doesn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t know love. There were quite a few lovers and mortals she didn\u2019t only take to her bed but also into her heart and whenever she did it; it left a mark on her soul. Circe loved deeply and gently and she always felt compassion for those men that came to her island and crossed her path. Well, at least until one day that changed everything. \u201dThey moaned and squealed, and pressed their snouts to the earth. We are sorry, we are sorry.Sorry you were caught, I said. Sorry that you thought I was weak, but you were wrong.\u201dAnd tell you what? I could understand her anger and wrath, because I think this was the first time she truly realized what had been done to her. The gods didn\u2019t intervene on her behalf and left her to her own devices instead and the trust she had given to those who had needed her help was betrayed in the worst possible way. Add to that her acute loneliness and you get a goddess that becomes embittered and vindictive. \u201dAnd so,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich do you change, and which do you let go?\u201d\u201cI change them all,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have come to my house. Why should I care what is in their hearts?\u201dHe had smiled and lifted his cup to me. \u201cLady, you and I are in accord.\u201dWho knows what would have happened if Odysseus would have never come to her island? Which kind of person would she have become? I guess we\u2019ll never find out and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s good the way it is. And here comes another scene that brought me immense joy, the moment Circe and Odysseus meet for the very first time. XD Gods, I loved their conversation so much! The tension and the way they tried to gauge each other\u2019s reactions by talking about seemingly simple things! This was so masterfully done, I can\u2019t even! One of the best book moments ever, I swear! <333 \u201dI confess I'm in awe,\" he said, \"they're never so quiet for me. You must have had quite an effect on them.\"I heard a humming, like before a spell is cast. His gaze was a honed blade. All this had been prologue. As if we were in a play, we stood.I\u2019ve always loved Odysseus and I\u2019ve been a huge fan of him ever since I read the Odyssey. I know he is a hero with many flaws and more morally grey than anything else, but this was always the reason why I loved him so much. He\u2019s human, he\u2019s intelligent, skilled, sly, he\u2019s honourable (most of the time) and he knows how to manipulate people in order to get what the wants. Some might say he\u2019s a dangerous man and they\u2019d be completely right with it. So what\u2019s not to love? *lol*\u201dThe world was made of mysteries, and I was only another riddle among the millions. I did not answer him, and though he pretended frustration, yet I began to see that it pleased him in some strange way. A door that did not open at his knock was a novelty in its own right, and a kind of relief as well. All the world confessed to him. He confessed to me.\u201dWell, anyway! Those two meet and they clash! And yes, I savoured every single moment of it. Their conversations were really intriguing and it\u2019s obvious Odysseus had a notable impact on Circe\u2019s life. In more ways than one, I might add. ;-P Considering the circumstances this actually sounded kind of dirty now. *lol* Never mind my particular choice of words. XDConclusion:It\u2019s undeniable that Madeline Miller has a way with words and no matter which kind of story she tells, she always seems to be able to turn it into gold. I loved how she managed to weave so many different parts of Greek mythology into \u201cCirce\u2019s\u201d tale and I adored that our heroine was a constant part of it all. The pacing of the book might have been very slow, but this didn\u2019t take away any of my enjoyment. Whilst the ending of \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d made me ugly cry, \u201cCirce\u2019s\u201d ending had an entirely different effect and gave me a sense of contentment and peace. This was definitely another one of Madeline Miller\u2019s masterpieces and all that\u2019s left to say is that I can really recommend it! ;-)P.S: Last but not least I want to thank the \"amazingly awesome and adorable Aoife\" (yes, that's supposed to be an alliteration ;-P) for buddy reading this book with me! <3 I know our lives didn't make it easy to go through with our BR but it was a lot of fun and I hope we'll go for another one soon! XD_______________________________Let\u2019s start the \u201cHow many books of my TBR 2019 can I pack into the last 5 weeks of the year\u201d challenge! ;-P The first book is \u201cCirce\u201d! Obviously! *lol* I should have read this gem ages ago but I was procrastinating too much and now I\u2019m trying to catch up! XD Since I loved \u201cThe Song of Achilles\u201d I have no doubt that I\u2019ll enjoy this too. Madeline Miller just has a way with words and I can\u2019t wait to dive into this! Hopefully I won\u2019t be as heartbroken as I was after reading TSoA though. >_<Please be gentle with me, Madeline!

Mel\n", "\nThis audiobook was amazing! Full review to come on my channel.\n", "8 April 2018Oh, gosh! I want it now! Can't wait for the publication! I expect it to be 5 stars... So, forgive me for prerating it already. It's like earmarking a favourite page...Remember, I'm a sucker for all things Ancient Greece. Classical mythos are my blood, my marrow... I grew up on them. Circe was never my fav, I felt she was a villain, a malicious sorceress for her part in Odyssey... Let's see if this book helps me get a different perception on this legendary gal.15 April 2018So... This is very different from how I imagined this.\u00a0First, we are acquainted with parental neglect. A one masquerading as a lot of different things.Then we go straight to other things. Pharmakis, witch... Funny, how I never gave a thought to how Circe got to be at that island of hers. I guess I just thought she liked it a lot there.\u00a0The ending\u2026 it was powerful, in its own right, in all the dimensions where it is unique. In our human world of today's insecure overachievers it seems weak and for the contemporaries, striving to do an inch better, to go a step further and to be a second faster - it might even seem defeatist. It's not so. It's the ultimate statement of freedom of self. One just needs to keep mind open to the realm of possibilities that Circe worked with, lived with and chose to do without.Q:WHEN I WAS BORN, the name for what I was did not exist. (c)Q:That word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures. In our language, it means not just goddess, but bride. (c)Q:My father glowed bright as just-forged bronze, while Oceanos had been born with rheumy eyes and a white beard to his lap. Yet they were both Titans, and preferred each other\u2019s company to those new-squeaking gods upon Olympus who had not seen the making of the world. (c)Q:Conditions, constrainment. These were novelties to my father, and gods love nothing more than novelty. (c)Q:\u201cCome,\u201d she said. \u201cLet us make a better one.\u201d (c)Q:My father had already departed for his chariot in the sky, and she was winding her hair with flowers, preparing to leave through the secret ways of water, to join her sisters on their grassy riverbanks. (c)Q:My father has never been able to imagine the world without himself in it. (c)Q:Divine days fall like water from a cataract, and I had not learned yet the mortal trick of counting them. (c)Q:hand. \u201cYou,\u201d he said to my luminous sister Pasipha\u00eb. \u201cYou will marry an eternal son of Zeus.\u201d He used his prophecy voice, the one that spoke of future certainties. My mother glowed to hear it, thinking of the robes she would wear to Zeus\u2019 feasts. (c)Q:Lampetia and Phaethousa, their names were. Radiant and Shining. (c)Q:Helios the Sun was bound to no will but his own, and none might say what he would do.\u00a0\u201cFather,\u201d I said that day, \u201care we late enough to kill astronomers?\u201d (c)Q:It was my first lesson. Beneath the smooth, familiar face of things is another that waits to tear the world in two. (c)\u00a0Q:\u00a0Hours passed, perhaps days. But even gods cannot watch a whipping for eternity. (c)Q:Bold action and bold manner are not the same. (c)Q:How does your divinity feel? (c)Q:I do think he loved me a little. For before I could say the thousand humiliating things in my heart, all the proofs of passion I had hoarded, the crawling devotions I would do, I felt his power come around me. And with that same flick he had used upon the cushions, he sent me back to my rooms. (c)Q:Those flowers had made him his true being, which was blue, and finned, and not mine. (c)Q:I had made so many mistakes that I could not find my way back through their tangle to the first one. ... I felt a sickening unease that it went back further still, back to the first breath I ever drew. (c)Q:I can veil the sky itself. Just try to watch me. (c)Q:The torches burned like stars, and overhead the ceilings stretched high as the sky\u2019s vault. For the last time, I watched all the gods and nymphs take their places. I felt dazed. (c)Q:My heart had leapt to see him as it always did. But he was like that column of water he had told me of once, cold and straight, sufficient to himself. (c)Q:The lands streamed by and the wind ran across my skin. I imagined pitching over that golden rail into the open air below. It would feel good, I thought, before I hit. (c)Q:All those years I had spent with them were like a stone tossed in a pool. Already, the ripples were gone. (c)Q:To be utterly alone. What worse punishment could there be, my family thought, than to be deprived of their divine presence? (\u0441)Q:We were nymphs, not worth the trouble. (c)Q:Even our exiles live better than kings. You see how deep our strength\u00a0runs? If you strike us, Olympian, we rise higher than before. (c)Q:Pharmakis, Ae\u00ebtes named me, witch, but all my strength was in those flowers, oceans away. (c)Q:No wonder I have been so slow, I thought. All this while, I have been a weaver without wool, a ship without the sea. Yet now look where I sail. (c)Q:The flowers, when they saw me, seemed to press forward like eager puppies, leaping and clamoring for my touch. I felt almost shy of them, but day by day I grew bolder, and at last I knelt in the damp earth before a clump of hellebore. (c)Q:I had a little pride, as I have said, and that was good. More would have been fatal. (c)Q:Let me say what sorcery is not: it is not divine power, which comes with a thought and a blink. It must be made and worked, planned and searched out, dug up, dried, chopped and ground, cooked, spoken over, and sung. Even after all that, it can fail, as gods do not. If my herbs are not fresh enough, if my attention falters, if my will is weak, the draughts go stale and rancid in my hands.By rights, I should never have come to witchcraft. Gods hate all toil, it is their nature. ...Witchcraft is nothing but such drudgery. Each herb must be found in its den, harvested at its time, grubbed up from the dirt, culled and stripped, washed and prepared. It must be handled this way, then that, to find out where its power lies. Day upon patient day, you must throw out your errors and begin again. So why did I not mind? Why did none of us mind? (c)Q:For a hundred generations, I had walked the world drowsy and dull, idle and at my ease. I left no prints, I did no deeds. Even those who had loved me a little did not care to stay. (c)Q:Then I learned that I could bend the world to my will, as a bow is bent for an arrow. I would have done that toil a thousand times to keep such power in my hands. (c)Q:One rose would give up its secrets if it were ground, another must be pressed, a third steeped. Each spell was a mountain to be climbed anew. All I could carry with me from last time was the knowledge that it could be done. (c)Q:I did not call dragons, or summon serpents. My earliest charms were silly things, whatever came into my head. (c)Q:My powers lapped upon themselves like waves. (c)Q:Into the air I said, Wherever you are, I hope you are finding your satisfaction.Which, of course, now I know she was. (c)Q:My gaze seemed brighter, my face sharper, and there behind me paced my wild lion familiar. (c)Q:Well? What do you have to say to me? You threw me to the crows, but it turns out I prefer them to you. (c)Q:I felt myself tremble, but I would not let him see it. Great gods smell fear like sharks smell blood, and they will devour you for it just the same. (c)Q:But there was something in me that was sick of fear and awe, of gazing at the heavens and wondering what someone would allow me. (c)Q:Hermes\u2019 mind was a thousand times sharper and more swift. It shone like light upon the waves, dazzling to blindness. (c)Q:Watching Zeus and Helios negotiate is always good entertainment. Like two volcanoes trying to decide if they should blow. (c)Q:He had fought in the great war, I remembered. He had seen the sky burn, and slain a giant whose head brushed the clouds. For all his lightness, I found I could imagine it. (c)Q:He made you want to spill your secrets. (c)Q:In a minute\u00a0he had unraveled one of the great mysteries of my life. ... It was a shock, and yet there was part of me that felt something almost like recognition. (c)Q:\u201cDo you know the name of this island?\u201d I said.\u201cI would be a poor god of travelers if I did not know all the places in the world.\u201d (c)Q:His eyes shone like dark gems held to light. They were black, one of the marks of deep-running power, from the line of the oldest gods. ... The same blood runs in all our veins. (c)Q:I owed him nothing. He would have of me only what I wanted to give. (c)Q:He was a poison snake, and I was another, and on such terms we pleased ourselves. (c)Q:My mother had gotten over her tears and added Mother of Witches to her titles, swanning with it among my aunts. (c)Q:We laughed over all of it, and when he left, I knew he told stories of me in turn: my dirt-black fingernails, my musky lion, the pigs that had begun coming to my door, truffling for slops and a scratch on the back. And, of course, how I had thrown myself upon him as a blushing virgin. (c)Q:\u201cI suppose you might go and visit Prometheus,\u201d I said. \u201cYou and your wings. Bring him something for comfort.\u201d\u201cAnd why should I do that?\u201d\u201cFor novelty\u2019s sake, of course. The first good deed in your dissolute life. Aren\u2019t you curious what it would feel like?\u201d (c)Q:My witchcraft, the island, my lion, all of them sprang from her transformation. There was no honesty in regretting what had given me my life. (c)Q:Monsters are a boon to gods. Imagine all the prayers. (c)Q:Would I be skimmed milk for crying, or a harpy with a heart of stone? There was nothing between. Anything else did not fit cleanly in the laughing tale he wanted to spin of it. (c)Q:I did not bring a torch. My eyes shone in the dark better than any owl\u2019s. (c)Q:Oh, Father, did you know the gift you gave me? For that flower, so delicate it could dissolve beneath your stepping foot, carried within it the unyielding power of apotrope, the turning aside of evil. Curse-breaker. Ward and bulwark against ruin, worshipped like a god, for it was pure. The only thing in all the world you could be certain would not turn against you. (c)Q:Yet always I remembered.Cold smoke, marked with my name. (c)Q:Of all the mortals on the earth, there are only a few the gods will ever hear of. Consider the practicalities. By the time we learn their names, they are dead. They must be meteors indeed to catch our attention. The merely good: you are dust to us. (c)Q:\u201cWhat a relief to hear of my reprieve,\u201d I said. \u201cI cannot wait to be freed from my terrible prison.\u201d The terraced hills around us glowed with spring. (c)Q:How could such variation endure, such endless iteration of minds and faces? Did the earth not go mad? (c)Q:That was what he desired most of all: to drive others into doubt, keep them wondering and fretting, stumbling behind his dancing feet. (c)Q:Fear of failure was the worst thing for any spell. (c)Q:But there was no wound she could give me that I had not already given myself. (c)Q:But now I understood more: he, too, knew what it was to make monsters. (c)Q:I did not walk as a mortal walks, but as a god, and the miles fell away beneath my feet. (c)Q:Most gods and mortals have lives that are tied to nothing; they tangle and wend now here, now there, according to no set plan. But then there are those who wear their destinies like nooses, whose lives run straight as planks, however they try to twist. It is these that our prophets may see. (c)Q:I felt an idea rise in me. I would need all the secret herbs of Dicte, and with them the strongest binding weeds, ilex root and withy, fennel and hemlock, aconite, hellebore. I would need as well the rest of my moly stores. I slipped through those trees unerring, hunting down each ingredient in its turn. If Artemis walked that night, she kept out of my way. (c)Q:I watched the knowledge settle on him. All the days ahead that he must be on his guard. He drew a breath. (c)Q:Griffins preened, delicate and regal, on the walls. The windows spilled sun. (c)Q:This was how mortals found fame, I thought. Through practice and diligence, tending their skills like gardens until they glowed beneath the sun. But gods are born of ichor and nectar, their excellences already bursting from their fingertips. So they find their fame by proving what they can mar: destroying cities, starting wars, breeding plagues and monsters. (c)\u00a0Q:Every step was perfect, like a gift she gave herself, and she smiled, receiving it. I wanted to seize her by the shoulders. Whatever you do, I wanted to say, do not be too happy. It will bring down fire on your head.I said nothing, and let her dance. (c)Q:They are not naturally fools, it is only that they are caught between two scorpions. (c)Q:He becomes the great king who begets monsters and names them after himself. (c)Q:In thanks, it would know no comrade, no lover. It would never see the sun, never take a free step. There was nothing it might ever have in the world but hatred and darkness and its teeth. (c)Q:I had never thought of having children, but looking at him, for a moment I could imagine it. As if I peered into a well and far below glimpsed a flash of water. (c)Q:I turned away from my cell. I walked as a god, unseen, past the drowsing guards, past the night servants. (c)Q:\u201cIt was a gift, of course. Who else would have enjoyed seeing me bleed so much?\u201d\u201cI can think of a thousand.\u201d (c)Q:\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she said, \u201cof naming my son Asterion. Do you like it?\u201dStarry one, it meant. \u201cThe prettiest name for a cannibal I ever heard.\u201d (c)Q:My mind was bare, my skin bristling as if it would rise off my flesh (c)Q:Timidity creates nothing. (c)Q:I was a goddess, and he a mortal, and both of us were imprisoned. But I pressed his face into my mind, as seals are pressed in wax, so I could carry it with me. (c)Q:But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me. (c)Q:The lion glared from my threshold. (c)Q:After my father\u2019s halls, the island seemed to me the wildest, most giddy freedom. Its shores, its peaks, all of them yawned out to the horizon, filled up with magic. (c)Q:I had walked the earth for a hundred generations, yet I was still a child to myself. Rage and grief, thwarted desire, lust, self-pity: these are emotions gods know well. But guilt and shame, remorse, ambivalence, those are foreign countries to our kind, which must be learned stone by stone. (c)Q:After I had sailed away, he said, Minos and Pasipha\u00eb\u2019s eldest, Androgeos, had visited the mainland and been killed near Athens. By then, the people of Crete were restive at having to lose their sons and daughters every harvest, and were threatening revolt. Minos seized his opportunity. He demanded, as payment for his son, that the Athenian king send seven youths and seven maids to feed the monster, or else Crete\u2019s mighty navy would bring war.

Armed and armored, she was, from head to foot, helmet, spear, aigis, greaves. A terrifying vision: the goddess of war, ready for battle. But why had she assembled such a panoply against me, who knew nothing of combat? Unless there was something else she feared, something that made her feel somehow stripped and weak. Instinct carried me forward, the thousand hours I had spent in my father\u2019s halls, and with Odysseus polymetis, man of so many wiles. (c)Q:But Athena had no babe, and she never would.

(c)", " \"But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth.\" Well this was just jam packed with loads of mythology, gods and goddesses and characters from antiquity!I loved spotting so many memorable names and stories, woven expertly into Circe's tale.Daedalus and IcarusPrometheus and his poor poor liverCirce's father - the Sun god Helios and his perfect white cattleHer sister Pasiphae, mother of Aridane, who befriends and aids Theseus in his destruction of the minotaur.Her brother Aaetes, father of Medea - lover of Jason, and history's original crazy lady. And of course the wanderer Odysseus, who along with his men discover Circe's island.Circe is a very well known character in mythology. The witch who turns men into pigs - she is portrayed as a villain, in only the brief chapter she has within The Odyssey. Madeline Miller gives new life to the character of Circe. We hear about her upbringing as a daughter of a Titan, her awful relatives and the absolute disassociation of the Olympian gods.When she is discovered to have certain 'witch like' powers, her father Helios banishes her to an island, to live out her days forever. \"You threw me to the crows, but it turns out I prefer them to you.\" She receives many visitors including Hermes, watches the coming and going of so many mortals. It seems divinity can be really damn exhausting. Without giving away all the different story aspects, she is included in so many lives, not least that of Odysseus; who is certainly shown in a different light in this book.Overall a fascinating tale filled with myths and characters. If you are familiar with Circe or not, it is an exciting read, and she is a truly great protagonist to meet. \"Those who fight against prophecy only draw it more tightly around their throats.\" 4 stars!", "Amazing book, utterly fascinating and compelling. Quite unusual and exceptional story. I like Circe, she is a strong woman (sorry, goddess, or witch goddess) and a courageous fighter. I like her style. The book cover says \"an intoxicating tale of gods and heroes, magic and monsters, survival and transformation\". Yes, that about sums it up, this great story. The only remark I would have is that the middle part, when Circe is with Odysseus, is a bit of a small dip, which is why this book just misses the 5 star mark for me.But other than that, a great book to read, almost breathless reading. Challenging and worthwhile! Four plus for me & recommended.When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities....", "\u201cHumbling women seems to me a chief pastime of poets. As if there can be no story unless we crawl and weep.\u201dSo\u2026I didn\u2019t realise that I unintentionally finished this on International Women\u2019s Day. Go me! Talk about perfect timing!!! :P Let\u2019s just take a moment to appreciate this book\u2019s beauty (photos not mine):  As someone who\u2019s studied the classics, I love mythology retellings. And practically all of them, really. I\u2019m even talking about the fun ones like The Lightning Thief and Half-Blood, as well as the trashy YA ones like The Goddess Test and Sweet Venom. Obviously, I adore the classic stories themselves, too, including: The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Metamorphoses, Theogony/Works and Days, The Oresteia: Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, The Eumenides, The Voyage of Argo: The Argonautica, Prometheus Bound and Other Plays, Medea and Other Plays, and The Three Theban Plays: Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus. I grew up on the Greek myths and if anyone tells me that a book is Greek mythology-inspired, it\u2019s an instant add to my overflowing TBR. #SorryNotSorryMoreover, I love villain origin stories, and as Circe is portrayed as one of the many villains in the Odyssey who stood in the way of Odysseus\u2019 voyage home to Ithaca\u2026I thought that this book would be perfect for me. In addition, Madeline Miller is such a highly acclaimed author, following the release of the tragic love story between Achilles and Patroclus in The Song of Achilles, which has been recommended to me, time and time again. However, it appears that it wasn\u2019t meant to be. No matter how many five-star ratings this book has received\u2026I just don\u2019t think that they were deserved. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. Miller is a wonderful author, with such a lush writing style that I felt as if I were reading a piece of epic literature. But she made Circe so\u2026boring?I saw a lot of references to Homer\u2019s Iliad, Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, Apollonius\u2019 Argonautica, Euripides\u2019 Medea, and even Telegony (one of the lost instalments of the Epic Cycle, about Circe and Odysseus\u2019 son, Telegonus, that we only have a summary of) and I absolutely LOVED how in depth Miller\u2019s research was. I\u2019m in awe, really. The one that really surprised me was her including storylines from Telegony, as most people haven\u2019t even heard of it because of its status as a lost Greek epic. One would presume that she\u2019d only include the more well-known epics, so I really want to give props to the detail that went into this retelling. Bravo!\u201cI thought: I cannot bear this world a moment longer. Then, child, make another.\u201dCirce is a titaness. A witch, or pharmakis. A mother. A daughter. A sister. A lover. And most importantly, a woman. This is the most feminist interpretation of Greek mythology that I\u2019ve ever come across, and for that, I am truly thankful. Too often, women are the victims or the villains in Greek mythology. Medea is the scorned woman who drives Jason to suicide. Medusa is the evil that Perseus must defeat. Ariadne is the damsel in distress, needing to be saved by Theseus. Helen is the pretty face that \u201claunched a thousand ships\u201d, who leads men like Hector and Achilles to their deaths. Megara is the innocent wife who is killed in a fit of madness by Heracles. Penelope is the faithful wife who awaits Odysseus\u2019 return home. Abused. Raped. Enslaved. Mutilated. Murdered. On and on, countless women are considered to be inferior or insignificant, in comparison with their male counterparts, the so-called heroes. Miller goes on to show that Circe isn\u2019t a strong character DESPITE being a woman. She\u2019s a strong character BECAUSE of it. For that reason, and for that reason alone, no matter what my complaints are about this book, I\u2019m grateful that it was written and that I have a copy on my shelves. This is the mythological retelling that needs to be read by all, male or female. Miller humanised an often-overlooked villain and empowered her in such a feministic way. Circe\u2019s embracement of her womanhood is both wonderful and painful, dramatic and tragic. And best of all, Circe is unapologetic for it. What a queen.In addition, Circe was definitely\u2026Cirsassy at some points: \u201cYou have always been the worst of my children,\u201d [Helios] said. \u201cBe sure to not dishonour me.\u201d \u201cI have a better idea. I will do as I please, and when you count your children, leave me out.\u201d \u201cFor a hundred generations, I had walked the world drowsy and dull, idle and at my ease. I left no prints, I did no deeds. Even those who had loved me a little did not care to stay. Then I learnt that I could bend the world to my will, as a bow is bent for an arrow. I would have done that toil a thousand times to keep such power in my hands. I thought: this is how Zeus felt when he first lifted the thunderbolt.\u201dIn all honesty, this novel began amazingly and had me entranced. There were so many gods, monsters, and heroes woven into this tale that I recognised. We meet Prometheus and see his punishment for giving fire to the mortals. We see Helios in his divine glory and his white cattle. Daedalus and Icarus also make appearances before they meet their tragic ends. After, there were Scylla and Charybdis, making the waters deadly to all who traversed there. Then, came Pasiphae, the mother of not only Ariadne, but also the Minotaur, who managed to cement herself in history. In addition, there was Aaetes, who also had the gift of witchcraft, but is most notable for fathering Medea \u2013 MY GIRL! Many beloved Olympians also grace Circe\u2019s island of Aiaia, including Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. \u201cThe truth is, men make terrible pigs.\u201dIt was near the middle, where the adventure slowed down, that my interest began to wane and I was projected into a reading slump. The best and arguably most iconic scene is when Circe invites men \u2013 who are lost at sea \u2013 into her home, sheltering and feeding them. While they ask her to kill her pigs for them to eat, she refuses, but does serve them food and wine. After her hospitality, they proceed to thank her by sexually assaulting her, prompting her to transform them into pigs and killing them. The chapter ends in an empowering moment, when she says, \u201cAs it turned out, I did kill pigs that night after all.\u201d You go, girl! After rejecting her divine relatives and disassociating herself with them, she embraces a simple and quiet life on the island that she was banished to, after her powers of witchcraft threatened Zeus. When Odysseus and his men wander upon her island, I thought that the novel would pick back up, much like the faster pace of the beginning, but that did not seem to be the case. If anything, it slowed down even further. Not only did I not enjoy the characterisations of Medea and Odysseus, but I found her daily routine to be a bore. In fact, I even read more than SEVEN novels in between this time. I was THAT unenthused. But the most uninteresting part to me\u2026and I have no idea why\u2026was Circe\u2019s experience with motherhood. I\u2019m not certain if Miller was trying to portray post-partum depression, but I ACTUALLY fell asleep here. It just wasn\u2019t holding my attention. Circe was a pretty awful mother and Telegonus was a terror of a child. Miller said in an interview that \u201cI wanted Circe\u2019s experience of motherhood to speak of things that are often excluded from ancient epics.\u201d Having said that, I wish that Miller hadn\u2019t included it. It\u2019s what dropped this book\u2019s rating from a five-star to a four for me. \u201cHe showed me his scars, and in return, he let me pretend I had none.\u201dI was pretty \u201cmeh,\u201d about Circe\u2019s casual relationship with Odysseus. I much preferred her pure affection for Daedalus early in the book or her mature bond with Telemachus later in the novel. Miller made my hero, Odysseus, to be utterly reprehensible, and she portrayed my favourite ancient Greek figure, Medea, to be a spoilt brat. How disappointing\u2026Regardless, the book turned around in the end, thank goodness. Once Telegonus grew with na\u00efve innocence, bringing Telemachus and Penelope to Aiaia, after having accidentally slain Odysseus, the novel picks back up to its faster pace in the beginning. Penelope finds her own path, Telegonus goes on his own adventure, and Circe and Telemachus travel the world together. The end was extremely satisfying and I was enjoying it so much that I didn\u2019t want it to conclude. In fact, my exact thought upon finishing the novel was, \u201cTHAT\u2019S IT?!!!\u201d If only the middle of this novel was of the same quality as the beginning and the end.From what I\u2019ve heard, Miller is currently writing a retelling of the Aeneid, centred around Dido, the first queen of Carthage, so I\u2019m really excited for that. I\u2019ve never come across Dido in literature, outside of the Aeneid itself, so I can\u2019t wait to see what Miller does with her story. I\u2019m also really hoping for a cameo from Telegonus, as he should be in the general vicinity, as well. So how long do I have to wait? 2020? 2021? Hopefully, not too long!!!", "\"A golden cage is still a cage.\" What a spectacular and moving reading experience this has been! I was educated in the particulars of mythology while partaking in one of my favorite pastimes, rather than running the risk of enduring a lengthy discourse in a lecture hall. I grasped so much on a personal level and was moved to tears when I reached the finish line. Furthermore, I have found a favorite witch in Circe to extol along with my best-loved sorcerer of all-time \u2013 Mary Stewart\u2019s Merlin!Prior to reading this, I was not well-versed in mythology. I recall taking a \u2018mini-course\u2019 about the major gods and goddesses in elementary school, followed by a little production with my classmates. I found it fascinating, but not something I pursued further until a high school English class introduced me to Odysseus and company. That was ages ago, and I\u2019m still a novice. I have been interested in reading Circe ever since some outstanding reviews caught my attention several months ago. I\u2019m always game to try a fantasy novel with the hope I may find a new favorite for that genre shelf that is not quite full enough. \"When I was born, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke to fish and nurtured flowers, coaxed drops from the clouds or salt from the waves. The word, nymph, paced out the length and breadth of our futures. In our language, it means not just goddess, but bride.\"Right from the beginning Circe does not fit in, not even with her own kind, her own family. Her destiny seems to be mapped out for her. She will not be someone to remember, not celebrated or worshiped like the greater gods and goddesses. When she provokes the wrath of her father, Helios, she is exiled to the island of Aiaia where it seems her eternal life will be friendless and without meaning. Circe will have none of that, however, and takes matters, as well as her newly discovered gifts, into her own hands. \"I will not be like a bird bred in a cage, I thought, too dull to fly even when the door stands open. I stepped into those woods and my life began.\" She hones her craft, pharmakeia, using the resources of the island and working hard to grow her herbs and nurture their magical properties. She befriends the animals of the island, keeping a lioness by her side as her familiar. Yet, her soul is always yearning for the company of another. For a while, Hermes, messenger of the gods, fulfills this role as he is the one deity that comes and goes freely on Aiaia. But one day when mortal men appear on her shore, Circe\u2019s whole being thirsts for this very different sort of companionship. I won't delve into all of Circe\u2019s encounters here. She will of course suffer from disappointment with mankind, causing her to use her craft as a weapon, meting out punishment to those that have abused her hospitality and trust. At the same time, she learns and grows from her experiences. There is such depth of development in Circe\u2019s character. She eventually meets Odysseus, relishing his physical presence as well as his intellect. \"I was not careful. I was reckless, headlong. He was another knife, I could feel it. A different sort, but a knife still. I did not care. I thought: give me the blade. Some things are worth spilling blood for.\" She remains always on guard, while enjoying his company. I was delighted when I realized that this was still Circe\u2019s story, and not just another homage to the famed adventurer and hero. This is a dazzling story of a strong woman that we can all admire, men and women alike. At a time when women are using their voices even more and are charting their own courses, Circe stands as an ideal heroine \u2013 not despite her flaws and insecurities, but because of them. She exemplifies what it means to rise above these imperfections, to learn from them, and to come out the other side as a better person. Standing by your choices and having faith and confidence in yourself will carry you far. Circe has enriched my thoughts on love, companionship, hard work, motherhood, and what it means to be mortal versus immortal. This is a book I would love to give to my own daughter to read one day, as well as one that I will keep on my favorites shelf at home. If you have given any thought to reading this book, now is the time! Put this on your Christmas list, if you celebrate. Or treat yourself to a copy \u2013 you deserve it! If you think you will not \u2018get\u2019 the mythological aspects, never fear. You are in excellent hands with Madeline Miller. I cannot wait to read more of her superb writing. A huge thank you to my friend Arah-Lynda, who recommended this book to me and whose outstanding review guided me towards this in the first place.\"It is a common saying that women are delicate creatures, flowers, eggs, anything that may be crushed in a moment\u2019s carelessness. If I had ever believed it, I no longer did.\"", "Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Pinterest | \nWHEN I WAS BORN, the name for what I was did not exist.\n  I was waiting for two whole months to get this book from the library. And I finally had a chance to read Circe from Madeline Miller. A book that everyone was talking about. The only thing you were gonna see on Instagram. Well, here I am \u2013 sitting with the cool kids now, I have read this book.The reason I wanted to read this book wasn\u2019t because I wanted to be part of the cool kids. Actually, it was because Greek Mythology has a special place in my heart. See, I was born in Macedonia, a country full of history, and so very close to Greece, where histories and cultures and traditions match and mix.When I was in school, our teachers focused hard on history. Especially Roman and Greek Mythology. So yes, I grew up with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey and yes, I know all the gods out there, what they do, who they married, who their children are.I have read about Circe, but I have never given her any meaning, as she is not mentioned a lot in Homer\u2019s works, as you might already know. And then suddenly, there is a book about her life. I had to read it!!!\nAND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!\n This might be my favorite book of 2018! I enjoyed Madeline\u2019s writing style. It was so explanatory and calm, and soothing, like swimming in nice calm waters. You would just gulp her words as you read, and before you know it, you have read 200 pages.Circe, oh Circe! Her character was so well described \u2013 such a strong powerful woman. We start with her childhood, to her growing up, and we follow the process of how she learned things the hard way, how she is naive, and then suddenly isn\u2019t, how she discovers the power she holds within, despite everyone else mocking her and saying otherwise. We see how she decides to say no, how she is not afraid to be a rebel, and how she suffers, and loves, and protects, and cares, and survives, and lives!You will read a story about the love a mother has toward her child, the love a woman has toward her man, the love a son has towards her mother, the love for freedom, the love for glory\u2026If you love Greek Mythology, you will get the chance to say hi to some of your favourite gods, nymphs, titans, monsters \u2013 Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, Prometheus, Odysseus and many more which I will fail to reveal.I hardly believe that this is a great book for introducing Greek Mythology to new young readers. I also hardly believe that this book will change the thoughts of many people, the way they see things, the way they live, the way they think.It was one of my favorite things about him: how he always fought for his chance. There are a lot of side characters that give their own meaning to the story as well, and there is also Odysseus, and at times it feels as this is his story, but in the end you realised that this story belongs to Circe only!\nDo not listen to your enemy, Odysseus had once told me. Look at them. It will tell you everything.I looked. Armed and armored, she was (Athena), from head to foot, helmet, spear, aegis, greaves. A terrifying vision: the goddess of war, ready for battle. But why had she assembled such a panoply against me, who knew nothing of combat? Unless there was something else she feared, something that made her feel somehow stripped and weak.Instinct carried me forward, the thousand hours I had spent in my father\u2019s halls, and with Odysseus polymetis, man of so many wiles.\n To all of you out there \u2013 please take your time to read this book! It will leave you breathless, inspired, motivated and it will change your life forever. It changed my life \u2013 that\u2019s for certain!", "I have been savouring this book for the past seven days. If I have not been active on here \u2013 at all, really \u2013 it\u2019s because I started my second year of university and also because I didn\u2019t want to be reading anything other than CIRCE (and my textbooks, ugh).I thought THE SONG OF ACHILLES was amazing, but it\u2019s nothing compared to this story. In both cases, you do not have to be familiar with the Greek gods and goddesses or mythology in general. I only had a basic understanding of it, and yet the author made it very easy for the reader to follow the narration. I didn\u2019t even know who Circe was prior to reading this book or that such a woman even existed. You hear of Zeus, Aphrodite, Poseidon and Athena all the time, but do you hear about nymphs often? No, you do not. They are described as extremely beautiful on the outside and extremely ugly on the inside. They are shallow, jealous, uncompassionate and manipulative. Circe is a nymph. But she is not particularly good-looking and her magic nonexistent. At least, that\u2019s what everyone thinks. This shows that you should never underestimate the underdogs. The more time Circe spends in the company of humans, the more she learns. Oh, she learns a few things from gods and goddesses too, but she despises most deities, and is conflicted about her own immortality. Her magic, though, she explores. Mostly in time of need, but the more she does, the more powerful she becomes. This is not one of those stories that end at the beginning. What I mean by that is that a lot happens between the first and last chapters. It progresses in an interesting way, because Circe spends most of her life in one single location, and yet people come to her and she goes to them as well. It\u2019s then character-driven and oh so beautifully-written. The first person POV worked incredibly well and made me connect with Circe in so many ways. I was rooting for her and I was right to do so. Please read it.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "4.5 starsSuch a great book! You do not need to be a fan of mythology to read this book! Confession - I requested this book because I saw it on a list about \"anticipated books of 2018\u201d It did not disappoint. If anything this book dazzled! Anticipate this book folks and rush out and get yourself a copy when it becomes available (or request it on NetGalley as I did!).Circe is the daughter of Helios, the god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans. Her mother, Perse, an Oceanid naiad is beautiful and captivating. Circe is born with a \"strange\" voice (she sounds like a mortal 0ohhhh the Horror!) and is often ridiculed by her younger siblings. Circe does not appear to have any powers but nevertheless, she is a God and lives in her father's home until she angers Zeus by transforming a nymph into a monster and a man into a creature. She is banished to live alone on an island. It is here, that she hones her true power - that of a witch! She has interactions with many characters, Hermes, the Minotaur (her sister's child), Athena, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, and Odysseus to name a few. She is caught between the world of the Gods and that of mankind.On her island, she learns the land, befriends the animals and assists sailors - turning some into pigs if they cross her or attempt to harm her. Eventually she has a child and is willing to do anything to protect him from the world and those who would do him harm. This book is beautifully written and very engaging. I found myself emerged in Crice's world and savored every page. Fiction and mythology blend beautifully to create a spellbinding book that does not disappoint. I'll admit, I'm not that familiar with mythology. I studied what was required in school and have a basic understanding of who is who but nothing in depth. One does not need to know much about mythology to appreciate and enjoy this book. The Author does a great job informing the reader who is who and what job they carry i.e. messenger of the gods, goddess of war, etc. Miller describes the Gods and characters brilliantly. I never felt like she was educating me on who was who. All the information flowed with the story. As I stated this book was very well written, the story-line is engaging, intelligent and sucked me in. This book is told through Circe's POV and we get an inside glimpse into her thoughts, feelings and emotions. Circe is a very likable character and over the course of time she becomes stronger, not only in her powers, but in herself. Her confidence grows, her judgement improves, she learns some hard lessons and grows as a person/God. She may have been considered a lesser goddess, but she was a strong female character who stood on her own two feet, stood up for herself and showed great bravery where others cowered.

When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a T\u00e4towierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism\u2014but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525962117l/38359036.jpg", "title": "The Tattooist of Auschwitz", "authors": "Heather   Morris", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38359036-the-tattooist-of-auschwitz", "reviews": ["I'll never hear Yiddish again....I'll never go to the German Consulate with her again...I\u2019m gutted reading this book. To some I have shared that my family's \"MA\" was in Auschwitz (everyone called her MA - her daughters, her grandchildren, her great grandchildren, her friends, etc.). She used to say \"I have lost everything that can ever be lost \u201cand \"I have given everything can that ever be given\". She passed away in 2017 at the age of 95. We just had her headstone unveiling. This was probably not the best book for me to read at this time - but then again maybe it was...In the last years of her life, I would go with her to the German Consulate to prove she was still alive, so she could continue receiving her reparation checks. She would get dressed in her best outfit and walk in proudly to announce she was still alive. There used to be a long line of survivors waiting to go in, the last time I went with her, we were the only ones in the waiting room. I used to dread going there with her. It was a production. Days before she would get her hair washed and set, the day of she would get up early and do her makeup and fuss over her outfit. I would always say \"why do you dress up to go there?\" She would always say \"I am proud of who I am.\" and tell me not to embarrass her by wearing my \"schmata\" and would it kill me to put on a little red lipstick. Then she would announce to everyone in the room that I was her granddaughter. Now I will never go again. Last year we had our first Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas without her (I have a half Jewish - half Christian family). There are not many survivors left in the world which is why I am glad that books like this exist.\"To Save one is to save the world.\"This book is based on a true story. I always love books based on true stories. In many ways, I think they are the best kind. I also love the pictures of Lale and Gita Sokolov. Lale told his story over the course of three years to the Author. Lale became the Tatowierer \"Tattooist\" of Auschwitz and Birkenau. Being the tattooist gives him special perks - more rations, better sleeping conditions, ability to move around the camp more freely. He also was able to exchange the money and prized possessions of those who died in the gas chambers for food and medicine. He was generous and provided for many. He saved lives and I wonder how many survived due to him acquiring medicine and extra food for them. While giving a tattoo, he meets Gita and feels an instant attraction to her. This book is not only a book about survival during the bleakest of times, it is about triumph of the human spirit, about being pushed to the breaking point but never breaking, about love, about compassion for others, about hope, about losing your faith and about never losing your faith. It also shows brutality, hatred, and evil but what I hope people take away is the compassion, strength, dignity and resilience that Lale and so many others named in this book showed. This book is about a lot of things but mainly one man's inner strength which allowed him to go on, to never give up, to have compassion for others, who risked his life many times to help others. During the darkest times, there will always be those who shine and Lale Sokolov was one of those.Like many survivors, Lale and Gita moved around until they found their place in Australia, began a family and lead a happy and successful life. Lale proved to have \"nine lives\" and I was happy to see that he was able to prosper and be reconnected with Gita after the war. I thought this book was well written and I was sucked me into Lale's world. Although there are scenes of violence and murder/killings, they are not incredibly graphic. With any book dealing with the Holocaust, you know it is going to be sad and scenes are going pull at your heartstrings. This one will as well. I think most will really enjoy this book and hopefully learn a few things. For instance, I always thought the tattoos were put on using crude tattoo machines/guns similar to the one used when I got a tattoo. I was wrong. My family member never talked about it. I wonder did Lale give Ma her tattoo? Who knows.?I think reading the Author's note at the end of the book is beneficial. Again, there are pictures of Lale and Gita there. It was nice to put faces with the names. When reading books such as this, I think most readers will wonder, could they have survived. I believe most of us will never know what we are capable of until we are placed to the test. God willing, none of us are ever placed to this test.4.5 starsI received a copy of this book from Bonner Publishing Australia and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com", "There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Holocaust fiction books in the English language alone. This is not the one to read.This kind of book is hard to rate. It's based on the true story of Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew who volunteered to go to Auschwitz to save his older brother and, through a combination of true grit and luck, he's able to survive and even fall in love. Who wants to give the story of a Holocaust survivor just two stars? Isn't that a bit heartless?But it's not subject of the book I'm rating. This book isn't well written. I wasn't surprised to learn that Heather Morris is a screenwriter, because she relies heavily on dialogue here and really struggles with prose (although, to be honest, the dialog leaves a lot to be desired, as well). Scenes change in the matter of a sentence, the dialogue often seems only broken with stage directions. There's no atmospheric build up. There's no sense of tension or urgency or terror. It was all very one-note. The characters, even Lale himself, are flat and poorly developed. The whole book felt very amateurish, and I cannot recommend it.I received an advance copy of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.", "What a waste of an amazing story on an incapable writer. There is no 'prose', there is really just \"he did this, and then he did that\". No depth of emotion, no depth of characters, heck - no characters! I couldn't tell you ONE personality trait of Gita's. Lale also, is so thinly drawn I know nothing about him other than he is supposedly charming. The dialogue between characters is ridiculously empty and the whole thing feels like the most superficial experience of Auschwitz possible.The love story, which I'm sure had depth and feeling in real life, is like a disney retelling. A sad sad waste :(", "Considering \"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" is a harrowing true story, it was truly compelling and utterly unputdownable. It's without a doubt one of only a few books that will stay with me a very long time, it's that unforgettable and one that keeps you thinking about the story well after you've put it down. Lale Sokolov is a well dressed, charming ladies' man - however he is also a Jew. On arrival at Auschwitz in 1942 he immediately stands out to his fellow prisoners who save his life when he takes ill. In the camp he is put to work in the privileged position of the 'Tatowierer' - the tattooist - to mark his fellow prisoners as they arrive in camp. One of them is a girl called Gita who captures his heart immediately. Given a reason to survive Lale uses his position for the greater good even through struggles and extreme suffering, with the hope of one day being with Gita forever, outside of the camp. Although upsetting, saddening and at times quite unimaginable, there is such a beautiful love story at the heart of the tale that you can't help smiling at. I immediately took to all the real life characters, they were excellently portrayed whether good or bad and could imagine the whole true scenario with such clarity.The author Heather Morris took several years to write Lale's story in her book with the input of the main protagonist himself and even becoming a very good friend with him. She has ultimately written a story Lale would be very proud of and which tells of his and Gita's tale of wanting to be together through one of the worst and sickening periods of our history with the utmost care and consideration. Compassionately written with sensitivity, its emotive, thought provoking, awe inspiring and certainly puts your own everyday problems into perspective.This book wasn't as brutal and as hard hitting as some holocaust books I've read although equally saddening, therefore I feel this could be read by slightly younger readers without offending or upsetting. I really can't recommend this stunning book highly enough, it a definite must read for 2018 and it gets a fantastic 5 stars for a heart wrenching unforgettable read.", "This is part of my Goodreads reading challenge for 2019 as the runner up in the \"Historical Fiction\" category.It has since been brought to my attention that this isn't historically accurate but it doesn't really change my review.As awful as it sounds, I felt so\u2026 detached from the characters. Characters inspired by true events during WWII.It wasn\u2019t to reflect the detachment of the characters to the events unfolding in an attempt to protect themselves. It was simply not well written. You would tell me 12yo wrote this I would believe you. The whole book was \"this happen, they said that and that happened...\". It was skeleton of a story (it's only 250 pages!) and knowing now it's not even accurate, it's hard to say this would be worth a read.Skip it, there are so many other amazing WWII books out there!", "Right after I started reading this book there was a story on the local news about a new exhibit at the Jewish Community Center in our area. The exhibit highlights the Holocaust survivors from this area. At kiosks you can click on a name, read a bio but what struck me the most was that you can also see a video of the survivor telling their story. The utmost importance of these stories is reflected at the beginning of this book by author Graeme Simsion: \"It reminds us that every one of the unimaginably large number of Holocaust victims was an individual with a unique story....\" . It's really not possible to know what it was like in Auschwitz or the other camps no matter how much we read about the Holocaust, but it is through the stories of the survivors that we can try to understand, even if only a little . Heather Morris has retold the story of Lale Sokolov, a Jewish prisoner at Auschwitz who becomes the camp tattooist and while there finds the love of his life, Gita. This stared out as a screenplay she wrote as Lale told her his story and has been developed into this \"novel\". Lale from the first day he arrives in Auschwitz by cattle car, makes a vow to himself that he would survive this and after falling in love with Gita, he makes a promise to her that they will have a life together when they are out . That he can speak multiple languages saves Lale multiple times as well as connections made with other people imprisoned, with workers from the outside and even a German guard. With jewelry and cash gotten from the women who work in the building where belongings are sorted, Lale with his savvy, his courage and with some luck barters for time with Gita for the price of chocolate, a piece of sausage , a hunk of bread, a diamond or ruby. But he also provides as much food as he can to others. He helps many people along the way putting himself in danger each day as each day he tattoos numbers onto the arms of the new inhabitants. He does seem to have an existence in some ways better than most in the camp and better than when he first arrived until he is caught with the jewels. It is obvious that he survives, so there's no spoiler here that Lale continues to have the capacity for hope and love that seems impossible as he endures. This is a story told with love about courage in the face of the horrors of the camps and loss of family, courage sustained by the strength of the human spirit and it's a love story that I'll never forget. There is not much more I can say other than what Lale himself tells Morris - that he wanted his story recorded so \"It would never happen again.\" I received an advanced copy of this book from Bonnie Zaffre through NetGalley. ", "I recall, as a child, accompanying one or the other of my parents to our family jeweler countless times. It seemed as if some piece always needed to be repaired or purchased for one occasion or another. For my tenth birthday I received a small sapphire and diamond ring which was too large and needed to be resized. One day after school off we went to see Marty and Irv. It was an unseasonably warm fall day and Irv had his shirtsleeves rolled up. When he placed his arm on the glass countertop, I saw the tattooed numbers on his arm for the very first time. I felt, also for the first time, a cold clenching my stomach. That very day, at the age of ten, I had watched Night and Fog as part of my fifth grade curriculum and my physical reaction was the painful shock of recognition. It was disturbing to me that this kind and gentle man had been subjected to and survived the death camps. I was raised to be a polite child so I didn\u2019t say anything but I do remember having a serious conversation with my mother about it on our way home.This experience, which is still so vivid to me, is one of the many reasons I find it difficult to rate \u2018based on true\u201d accounts about the holocaust. What I will say about this book is that it tells a story of hope amid horror. I will also say that the writing is sophomoric. However, I do think this is a book that is well suited for young teens as an introduction to this very dark part of history.", "A unsettling but gripping novel, based on the true story of Lale, a Slovakian Jew caught up in the horrors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during WW2. He speaks several languages, so soon finds himself employed in the camp as the tattooist, the man responsible for inscribing prisoners numbers on their arms. He soon meets and falls in love with Gita, a fellow inmate., but can their love survive the horrors of life inside a concentration camp? This is a beautifully told tale, Heather Morris captures the essence of the camp well. I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau earlier this year and found it to be chilling and disturbing. One can only speculate at the deranged minds of those that caused such suffering. I read through this book it quickly in one sitting, and though it outlines the horrors of war, it shows the strength of the human spirit, and that there is always something to hope for. Highly recommended, this is one that will stay with you for a long time.", "An interesting tale based on a true story but not really comprehensively told. I enjoyed what was there but there seemed to be so much left out.Lale was obviously a charming rogue who managed to survive all those years in Auschwitz despite bringing himself to the attention of the authorities repeatedly and in very serious ways. It was amazing that a life long love affair could have begun in such a place and even more amazing that they both survived and found each other again after the war. Obviously it was meant to be. There must have been a lot more to this story than we are made aware of. I found the author's style to be simplistic which left me detached from events. I even felt occasionally that the book was aimed at a young adult audience as various atrocities were mentioned only in passing. As a reader I never felt the pain or the sorrow, just watched it from a distance. To me the author let the subject down.Fortunately the story is so incredible it stands up for itself. A good read, but not a great one.", "4.5 stars!!This is a historical fiction novel based on a true story. Lale Sokolov tells his story based on true events. He became the main tattooist of Aushwitz and falls in love at first sight with Gita who he first met tattooing her arm. He tattoos all the new prisoners with their identification numbers. Lale is a Jew. He is on the first transport of men from Slovakia to Auschwitz in 1942. The concentration camp was very horrifying. Lale did have some special privileges, since he was the tattoist. He had lots of freedom than the other prisoners. He was so brave and had lots of courage. He would exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep others alive. If he was caught he would of been killed. Many prisoners owed him their survival. He was a leader among the other prisoners. Their are some graphic scenes that are a little dark. This book stands out from other Holocaust related novels. It is an emotional read. The Nazi guards are monsters, they kill and hurt human beings. Lale was determined to survive. This is a terrible story but it also is a story of hope and courage. I really did love this story. It was almost like reading a memoir, but a little different than a memoir. This story is an emotional read, but I also found it uplifting at times. The Holocaust was horrific and couldn't believe all the awful things that happened in the concentration camp. I would say this is a safer read than other Holocaust novels.I really loved Lale's true story. I am so happy that the author spent a lot of time with him, to tell his story. She really did an amazing job on his character. All the characters were very well done and made this novel come alive. I loved the love story between Lale and Gita and how they fall in love at first sight. I love a romance in a novel only when there is lots of suspense. Its always the suspense that I am looking for and this one has okplenty of it. I felt so sad for Cilka, and everything she went through. I also felt sad for Leon. There are some scenes that are graphic but this is the Holocaust, a horrifying time and as I mentioned before this is a safer read than other Holocaust books. I could not put this book down. It was a page turner. I loved the writing style. I am really loving historical novels more and more because I think they are needed because we need to remember what happened so that history isn't forgotten.This was a Traveling Sister read and I loved reading this with them and it was a wonderful discussion. This is a great book to do as a group read.I want to thank Netgalley, the publisher and Heather Morris for a copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.", "what a comfort it is to know that, even in the most desperate and tragically unfathomable of circumstances, love and hope are possible and can be found. this was a truly touching story about lale and gita and how the love they found for each other in auschwitz helped them survive. the story is based on true events, information gathered from lales interviews with the author. lale waited until after the death of gita to open up about his experiences due to fear of being perceived as a nazi sympathiser. but goodness, this was a story that needed to be told. and i feel rather heartless giving a book with that sort of gravity anything less than 5 stars, but i was very let down when it came to the writing and the way the story was told. i would have much rather heard the story told from lale himself, as i dont think heather morris did his story justice. the writing was very flat and didnt evoke the sense of emotion i would have hoped for from a story as memorable as this. regardless, i am still grateful i read this, for there were so many valuable lessons within this book. lessons on what it means to be human, how far one would go to survive, how love can be found anywhere, and most importantly, the power of hope. \u21a0 3.5 stars", " \u201cIf you wake up in the morning, it is a good day.\u201d  This was a really tough novel to read - I mean obviously, it is set in Auschwtiz - it was hardly going to be a walk in the park!I don't think I quite prepared myself, or wasn't able to entirely remove myself from the novel, so became completely invested and because of this, it absolutely tore me apart.Based on a true story - Lale uses his education and knowledge of languages to get himself a job as the Tatowierer after each Jewish family must volunteer one young male for 'work'. This 'work' turns out to be the concentration camps on Auschwitz and Birkenau. We witness first hand the atrocities Lale sees happen, and also the cruelty and torture he endures at the hands of the Nazi's. Despite knowing this was a 'memoir' of sorts, and that Lale would eventually escape, I was still terrified when reading this. Books like this need to be published and read, as I think that despite everyone knowing what the Holocaust was, I think people might be in danger of forgetting just how truly horrifying it was, and the lowest depths of humanity.Though not always 100% gripping, I feel that it added to storytelling. Not everyday was filled with violence, some days nothing happened at all - and the prisoners whiled away the days, too starved or beaten to really do anything. Non-fiction books aren't always designed to be enthralling, and for me this story's purpose was more for education and the sharing of someone's past, rather than to simply entertain the reader.I've seen a few reviews commenting on the writing style, how it is written quite factually rather than emotionally, and to be honest I do agree. It is written more as a timeline, than a novel. There is a lot of focus on the romance, where I would have rather had more info on the other prisoners/conditions etc. But I understand it was done this way because it is the couple's story to tell; I just would have preferred more detail in other places. (view spoiler)[ For example, how he was able to find Gita so quickly at the end. He just turned up at the train station and she just got off?! Is that actually how easily it happened? I would have liked to have seen a bit more of his research into how he knew she would be there? Or was it literally just fate?

Politics and religion both.\" ", "The German government needed workers for their labor camps. In 1942, all families in Slovakia were ordered to provide a child eighteen or older for work detail or risk having the entire family sent to concentration camp. Lale Sokolov hoped that by going to Prague to await these instructions his family would be safe. He did not expect to be forced into a cattle wagon and be transported to Auschwitz. He was determined to do as he was told, reveal little about himself and always be observant.Lale's upbeat manner as well as deference to his capo helped him secure the job of \"Tetovierer\", the tattooist. Rules: Look down. Be quick and efficiently tattoo the five numbers written on each person's piece of paper. In order to survive, he had to defile innocent people. The job of \"Tetovierer\" did have some perks. Lale was given his own room and increased food rations which he hid under his sleeve to distribute to others when possible. One day, Lale saw a girl with the darkest brown eyes. Gita. He made a vow to himself. He will leave Auschwitz a free man. He has just met the love of his life!Through cunning, luck and love, Lale is instrumental in setting up a barter system with paid bricklayers, Victor and Yuri. Food and medicine are exchanged for gems and currency smuggled out of the \"Canada\" building where some of Gita's friends work to empty the pockets of clothing from new arrivals at Auschwitz. Diamonds and chocolate entice an occasional guard or capo as well.\"The Tattooist of Auschwitz\" by Heather Morris is based upon the harrowing experiences of Lale Sokolov in Auschwitz and Birkenau. The chilling accounts of total disregard for life are occasionally tempered by selfless goodness and sacrifice without which Lale and Gita's love story could not have been told.

", "\nThis is an incredible book with a story that demands to be heard. \nThe year is 2018 and it gladdens me that books like this are still being written. It\u2019s important that we never forget Auschwitz and that we never forget the war crimes Nazi Germany committed. Why? Because we need to know and understand what humanity is capable of, we need to know what extreme hate looks like so we can work towards building a world free from it. This is one of our darkest hours, and we need to remember it. This is a true story. The characters were real people. They were plucked from the mind of a dying old man (who is also the protagonist) who wanted his story to be heard by the world. It took him over seventy years to muster the courage to tell it, Morris is the instrument of his words. So this isn\u2019t a book that dramatises the events or capitalises on the situation in order to sell a thrilling piece of fiction; it simply portrays the horrors as they were: it doesn\u2019t need to be exaggerated because it is in itself so horrifyingly real. We all know about Auschwitz, though there is something intimate about this particular story. \u201cHow can someone do this to another human being? He wonders if for the rest of his life, be it short or long, he will be defined by this moment, this irregular number: 32407.\u201d Lale was the man responsible for tattooing identity numbers onto new entries into Auschwitz. It\u2019s a role he hated, one where he felt like a collaborator as he defiled the bodies of innocent with the ink of the enemy, though it is also a role that afforded him many benefits. He was given a position of trust and was able to move around the camps at will. As such he smuggled in extra food rations for those that needed it most. He brought them medicine and aid whenever he could, consolation for living apart from those that suffered the most. The narrative was incredibly tense because death was never far away. All it took was one annoyed guard to raise his rifle and pull his trigger, and that\u2019s it: it\u2019s all over. Death came randomly. There was no system, just merciless killing at the whim of the oppressors. Doctor Mendel (Doctor Death) was the best example. He was an evil man, cold and fear inducing. Whenever he entered a scene the trepidation of the characters was palpable. It\u2019s like the temperature dropped. Morris did wonders to capture the presence of such a callous man. With all darkness, there comes light. In the depths of the death camp there is also life, love and family: three things we all need to stay alive. Despite how cruelly the Jews were treated, despite how far they were objectified and made to feel less than human, they still managed to cling onto their identities and the very things that make them who they are. Hope endured for some, hope that they would some day be liberated and have the opportunity to begin a new life. And that\u2019s exactly what makes the hero of the novel so compelling. He never looses his optimism. He never stops trying to help people. \n\"To save one is to save the world.\"\nHis love for his wife Gita kept him from dropping dead. And it wasn\u2019t until she died in real life, many years later, that he released their story. And it\u2019s very powerful one.Blog | Twitter | Facebook | Insta | Academia", "Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love this book, it fell quite short for me. Perhaps it was the expectation I always harbor for a book about the Holocaust, or perhaps the book contained things that I just had a hard time believing. This was basically a love story between two people, Lale and Gita who met while she was waiting to be tattooed by Lale and instantly fell in love. They manage to meet on many occasions and share time together and even make love. Lale, meanwhile is able to collect diamonds, money, and other jewels from people working in the sorting of prisoners' clothes which he barters for food, chocolate, and other things with a Russian workman and his son. He shares his food with those that he can which of course is a wonderful thing to have done. Eventually, when the war is close to ending, he is freed and while Gita has been sent away from Auschwitz he eventually meets up with her and they marry and have a son after immigrating to Australia.In thinking about this novel, I believe it was the writing of the story which held it down for me. It seemed that the author made the telling so matter of fact and I could not perceive an emotional empathy that one is ever so sure any prisoner in Auschwitz would certainly have had. I know that both Lale and Gita were real people who suffered immensely in the camp and of course lost so many family and friends. My heart breaks ever time I read a book that details the atrocities that were done to the Jews, Gypsies, handicapped and others during the war. So, I am very sad that I did not connect with this story. At the end of the book, Lale and Gita's son wrote a foreword which was quite good with the right amount of emotion and love for his parents. I think perhaps he should have taken up the task of writing his parents' story. For through his few short pages, I saw more of Lale and Gita than the author showed me with the entire book.Interestingly I just read this article...https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/...", "\n\u201dBased on an incredible true story\u201d\n as this states on the cover, this is the story of Lale Sokolov and Gita, the woman who he meets at Auschwitz, both prisoners there. At first Lale is working on a roof, and this is what he does for a while until his kapo says he needs a boy to do his bidding, run errands, bring him food and the like. Then fate intervenes somewhat again for Lale when he becomes the tattooist, the T\u00e4towierer for both Auschwitz and Birkenau, a position under the Political Wing that answers only to Berlin.He meets Gita, whom he only knows by the number he tattooed to her arm, no words exchanged of course. A slip of paper with the number that was to be permanently marked on her skin were the only words that accompanied her. Eventually, he manages to introduce himself through channels and messages passed. Eventually an infatuation turns to love. \n\u201dChoosing to live is an act of defiance, a form of heroism.\u201d\nBut love is not the only emotion he feels there, having to stand by as the likes of Mengele get pleasure from inflicting terror and humiliation on all, but especially the female prisoners. Impotent rage, horror, fear, sympathy and an overwhelming sense of powerlessness engulf him, not only for him, but for all those prisoners subjected to the torture, abuse, humiliation. \n\u201dThe twinkling of stars overhead is no longer a comfort. They merely remind him of the chasm between what life can be and what it is now.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never been to Auschwitz or Birkenau, but many years ago I went to Dachau when I was in Munich on business. A group of us went there together, even the memory it still makes it hard for me to breathe. Photographs of the conditions, of how it appeared for those who were held captive \u2013 not so much living, but barely existing there. Each had their own stories, but we don\u2019t often have access to an account such as this one, which makes it all the more important. That these people are more than just numbers to be totaled, they are people who loved, who were loved and had hopes and dreams. My deepest respect goes to the author for having the compassion and emotional stamina to hear these stories directly from Lale Sokolov, and bring these stories to us in such a truly lovely ode to love and the will to survive. Lale\u2019s story broke my heart into a hundred pieces and then you somehow managed to put it back together again in this poignant story of the saving grace of a love found even in the darkest of times.  Pub Date: 01 Feb 2018Many thanks for the ARC provided by Bonnier Publishing Australia / Echo", "Reviewing a novel about the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance day seems both apropos, and a great responsibility. Never forget! As long as there are people who need to tell! Their stories, I will continue to read and remember. This is a fictionalized account of a true story, told to the author in the final days of his life. Lale was a young Jewish man from Slovakia, with much to look forward to, when in an effort to save the rest of his family, he is taken to Auschwitz. There he will become the tattooist, the man who tattoos those horrendous numbers on the prisoners arms. A prestigious job in the camp that gives him priviledges many don't have, also a certain freedom. How he uses this freedom is a big part of the story. A story with many horrors terrors and yes even love.I dislike rating these stories. I always feel like I am rating, in this case, a man's life, passing judgement on his horrifying experiences. They were, but this young man was fortunate, not a good word to use obviously, in many instances that found others either shot or beaten to death. He had a sunny personality and vowed to survive the camp, maybe the reason the tone of this was more light than many others of the camps that I have read. Maybe this is the story he needed to remember to survive, only he can know that. The writing is less emotional than some, a kind of storytelling tone, which I guess makes sense as the author was telling a story. For me though, often times, I felt an emotional disconnect. It is though, impossible not to like Lale, he indeed uses his position, well. We meet other important characters, the young woman who he would come to love, her friends. Some of the guards, and all play their parts in this story.I do love how at the end of the book the author lets the reader know what happened to some of the main people in this novel. One young women's fate I found particularly unfair. At the end there is an added bonus and it is here that I felt all the emotions I had been missing. Never forget!!!A sisters read that provided a very interesting discussion.ARC from Netgalley.", "This is the true story of real survivors who are determined, strong and brave enough to breathe and fight no matter what they\u2019ve been through. They were just chosen innocent victims did what they had to so they could stand against the monsters hid inside human furs and at the end they fought back with their tears, endurance, wit, belief and they won against the vicious, vulgar, savage hand life dealt to them. Lale and Gita\u2019s heartfelt, poignant, unconditional love and surviving story will always stay with me throughout my life. When you look at their photos, you feel like you\u2019re touching a part of human history with your hands. This book shakes you more than you expected, making you question humanity, love, life, shameful part of the story that we never forget. It\u2019s haunting, soul crushing, heartfelt, dark, intense but also inspirational and hopeful. It\u2019s a great guide how to embrace our lives and learn our lessons from history and power of love, friendship. This remarkable book is always going to be one of my all-time favorites.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "Against all odds...The story of two extraordinary people, Lale and Gita survive the horrors of Auschwitz and find solace in each other. The book is based on their true story.Lale has the job of tattooist and must tattoo numbers on the arms of countless men, women and children. One day he tattooed #34902 on the arm and Gita. He recalled this day as the day \"he tattooed her number on her left arm, she tattooed her number on his heart.\" An incredible and memorable story that shows the strong will of human survival and the risks that so many took to save not only their own lives, but those of others. The story follows their years together at Auschwitz and beyond the war. The writing was straight forward without a lot of depth into the characters emotions, yet as a reader, it stirred up all my feelings of intense sadness, fear and shock of what they endured. Many thanks to Bonnier Publishing/Netgalley for my ARC in exchange for an honest review.", "This is a novel based on the true story of Lale and Gita Sokolov, two Slovakian Jewish prisoners at Auschwitz. Lale, being able to speak many languages, was given the job of tattooing the numbers on the incoming prisoners, he met Gita when she was in his line to be tattooed and was immediately taken with her.Being the tattooist at the camp gave Lale much more freedom of movement then most prisoners and he came upon money and jewels from the murdered Jews to get food to keep other prisoners alive.Lale was so brave, he took many risks, could have been killed at any time if caught, but his strong determination for the survival of he and Gita was above all else.Huge thank you to NetGalley for this Read Now advanced copy!", "This is a very, very difficult book to review.There are certain books that tell a story so important that it overrides other aspects of itself, and therefore can overcome certain narrative shortcomings. The Hate U Give, for example, may not have been the most well-written thing I\u2019ve ever read, nor will the characters stay with me forever - but the story will.I\u2019m in a similar situation here. This is the story of Lale, a Jewish man who became the tattooist at Auschwitz and used the relative privileges this position allowed him to feed himself and others, fall in love, make friends, and ultimately survive.Lale is a real man, and this is a true story, but in spite of the fact that Heather Morris interviewed Lale in order to capture it, this is still categorized as historical fiction. And that categorization shows.I read a lot of reviews of this in order to figure out how to explain my inability to fall in love with it, and a line Amanda\u2019s resonated with me: \u201cI can't help but wonder if viewing concentration camps with the rose colored glasses Lale seemed to wear is damaging to the way some readers will think of the holocaust experience.\u201dLike many modern readers, I\u2019ve read lots of stories of the Holocaust, and been shocked and horrified by each one. This is the first I\u2019ve encountered that didn\u2019t seem to focus first on the suffering and evils of it.Above all, this is a love story. And while that\u2019s beautiful, and for many may inspire faith in humanity and the human experience, I felt some small amount of discomfort.The Tattooist of Auschwitz skips and glosses over some of the greatest horrors of the Holocaust (one of the most nightmarish events in human history) and of Lale\u2019s time in one of the most gruesome concentration camps, and instead focuses, unrelentingly and always, on the romance. I think Lale\u2019s remarkable, miraculous story deserved to be told, and I\u2019m happy Heather Morris did so, and often did so adeptly, but I worry about upholding stories of the Holocaust in which the major takeaway is love and joy and happily ever after.There are upsides to this, but we should never forget the truth of what it was.Bottom line: Lale is a remarkable man who likely saved an unknowable number of people, and I\u2019m grateful I now know his story. I just wish I\u2019d read it in a work of nonfiction.---------i'm ready to have my heart stomped on", "4 utterly unforgettable stars to The Tattooist of Auschwitz \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f This is the story of Lale and Gita Sokolov, two Slovakian prisoners at Auschwitz who fell in love and all the risks and sacrifices made by them and others to keep them alive and together.It all began with Lale and how he was chosen to be the person who tattoos numbers on the prisoners at Auschwitz and Birkenau. As one can imagine, this was heartbreaking work; but as Pepau (a fellow tattooist) told Lale, at least it was being done by someone with a heart. Through this job, Lale had favor at prison and ended up sharing the wealth with as many prisoners as he could. Lale ran into Gita, a woman he has met before, prior to being imprisoned, and their love grew from there.Lale and Gita offered a unique and complex perspective on the Holocaust. At first, I was taken aback by their story and the extreme peril they risked by being together. But then it made me wonder if there were any other stories like Lale and Gita\u2019s? Others who jeopardized their lives for love while living in impossible and incredibly dire circumstances? Overall, I loved this book. Lale\u2019s positive spirit, humanity, and courage grabbed hold of my heart. I\u2019m grateful he told his story. Thank you to Heather Morris, Bonnier Publishing, and Netgalley, for the complimentary copy to review. The Tattooist of Auschwitz will be released on January 27, 2018", "As with all holocaust stories, my heart hurts. It bleeds for all those who suffered and still shocks me. But the survivors and the hope is unbelievably real. How anyone ever recovers, I will never know. Forgiveness and healing are themselves a miracle and Each story as necessary and precious as the next.Thank you, Lale, for sharing yours. 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f", "I\u2019m always reluctant to read works of fiction dealing with the Holocaust - although I\u2019ve read my fair share. It\u2019s not that I find it too hard to read about atrocities, it\u2019s that I worry that unless they are done right, fictional accounts run the risk of trivializing this horrific chapter in human history.The Tattooist of Auschwitz reads like fiction, but is based on interviews the author conducted with its protagonist, Lale Sokolov, over a three year period very late in Lale\u2019s life. A Jew transported from Slovakia to Auschwitz, Lale survived almost three years before the end of the war. For most of that time, he was assigned the task of tattooing numbers on the arms of Jews being brought into the camp. This gave him a bit of a privileged position in terms of food and housing, and also allowed him to move a bit more freely so he was able to develop a relationship with another prisoner, Gita, who is also a survivor. They married after the war. The genesis of how Lale came to tell the author his story includes an admonition not to judge him until she heard the whole story. And this points to the core of Lale\u2019s story. What does it take to survive in a place like Auschwitz? After, once you\u2019ve survived, what rationalizations are required to stave off the guilt of surviving when so many died? Ultimately, while it\u2019s based in real historical events, The Tattooist of Auschwitz reads like a work of fiction. It is Lale\u2019s recollection of his life during World War II as he has told it to himself. It reads like fiction because at times it does feel a bit romanticized or smoothed over around the edges. The atrocities are there, but Lale\u2019s strong spirit and survival instinct seem larger than life. This isn\u2019t a criticism and I am not judging Lale. I suspect all survivors have to make sense of what it took to survive. I also suspect that they judge themselves far more harshly than anyone else does. I\u2019m grateful to have had a chance to read about Lale and Gita\u2019s story and I\u2019m happy to know that they were able to make sense of their horrific experience and live happily for many years after the Holocaust. Their story is well worth reading.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy.", "It\u2019s not the story that I am giving 1* here, but the godawful writing. Reading this book is literally like reading a set of bullet points. The book is heavy on dialogue (not terribly well written either) with little description in between. The author thanks the real Lale Sokolov for allowing her to write his story, but I wish to god somebody else had written it instead. The absolute worst thing about the author\u2019s take on this story is that she made me feel NOTHING. This is an incredibly emotive topic and I found myself not giving a damn about the fate any of the characters and that in itself is very sad considering the setting of the story. ", "4.5 stars! My heart opened up and welcomed Lale in from the first page of this powerful story. This is a truly unforgettable story of one man\u2019s journey of survival through one of the most horrendous and appalling times in our history \u2013 Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz. Lale Sokolov survived the brutal hell known as Auschwitz for over two years where his \u201cjob\u201d was to tattoo prisoners with their identifying number. What he endured and witnessed is nothing short of horrific and devastating. The author, Heather Morris, did an outstanding job giving Lale a voice. I will not ever forget reading this life changing and emotional story. How wonderful that Lale\u2019s legacy will live on through the wonderful work of Heather Morris. It is so important that stories like this are not forgotten.This was a Traveling Sister read which really enhanced the experience for me.

Lale with compassion and sensitivity, tattoos numbers on the arms of prisoners. While doing this he forms a connection with Gita that leads to a tender and charming love story. Heather Morris does a good job capturing the life of Lale and the conditions he lived with, without adding unnecessary graphic scenes that we all really appreciated here. At times the story is dark and haunting and we really could feel the heartbreak of the horrific setting of this story. We also felt hope in the love and affection Lale and Gita had for each other in such dark times. Some of us did feel the love story seemed hard to believe under such horrific conditions but still allowed us to feel hope in times that seemed so hopeless. This is Lale\u2019s account of what he needed to do to survive with dignity and I am so glad I got the chance to hear this uplifting and inspiring story of courage and love. I hope you all do too and I highly recommend. Published on January 27, 2018Thank you NetGalley, Bonnier Publishing and Heather Morris for a copy to read and review.

He was a likable man went by the rules to stay alive, but also suffered the brutal beatings due to his jewells he had hidden in his bag. He eventually became the tattooist which he hated as it was inflicting pain on others that he didnt like, but then he met Gita the girl of his dreams he tattoed her & they became lovers.Lale then got onside with & S S soldier Baretski he wouyld do favours for & visa versa, but when men women & children are taken in the night without any warning fear grips Gita & her friends, eventually Cilka had to sleep with the head guards just to stay alive this was terrible but in the end she did what she did to survive the attrocities of Auschwitz she was a survivor but many didnt make it.This strory had to be told both Lale & Gita are strong even though at times you saw weakness it was a harrowing read & at times i i felt anger at what Lale, Gita & their friends had to endure.

I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It \"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid. Quite frankly-this book is amazing. ", "Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's \"New Releases\" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader.

When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.", "Review for Illustrated EditionPerfect.

There's a reason us, the Fans, feel that we're connected, no matter where we from, different culture, ethics, ages..we're all graduated from there....Hogwarts.. even like we were in same class,classmates, no matter which edition we read....Cause Harry Potter is not just a story..it's a Life..The Boy Who Saved Flourished the Book IndustryIt's One of the most important novels in modern history, Sorry, it's The Most Important ONE.This Review also for those who hate the series !Please bear with me..Without it, most Book stores & publishers may have the same fate of Video Stores like Blockbuster LLC, which, despite being super popular in the 90s, closed all the stores by 2013, shutting down forever.Yes, without this Novel, and with the rapid change in technology, the ease of making e-books and reading it in PCs, Smartphones, Tablets..etc, the publishing and trade of new paper books may decrease rapidly.It'd be limited for religious or educating books, classics, small novels. Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel, The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,\nA Brief !! History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------\nWell, let\u2019s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens, not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo\u2026 Those of this new generation who read are \u201cweirdos\" or \"nerds\u201d to the rest of their peers.And for those \u201cfew who read\u201d, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie -what\u2019s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?- , also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine\u2019s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there\u2019s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made \u201cPocket Novels\u201d for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There\u2019s also \u201cReading for All\u201d, project by the first lady \u201cSusan Mubarak\u201d, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract \u201cmore and more\u201d of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don\u2019t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractive Reading Experience to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it\u2019s Playstation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman\u2019s comics when you can play them..\n~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~\nSo by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it\u2019s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it\u2019s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when Joanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it, and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it\u2019s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest \u201cBloomsbury\u201c agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she\u2019d get a day job, since it\u2019s a little chance of making money in children's books. - later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother\u2019s \"Kathleen\" come the 2 initial of her pen name..\nJ . k . Rowling\nAnd in 26 June 1997 , with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\nAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.In 1998 Book Two released in UK , 1999 in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.\n\nAnd on 8 July 1999, The \nFirst Breaking Record\n made when Book Three sold 68.000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple stores as happening theses days, But it was in front of Bookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of... Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language. And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then, but that's not our subject now. \n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nWith the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.\n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nThe good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By 2002 ,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And in April 2003 Dan Brown (previously published 3 novels, making good sales) released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records, The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later, May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel, The Kate Runner  which also made a very good records too. -Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)- And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On 20 June 2003 book Five 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years. Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time.A New world Record ,5 millions copy at the first day only..For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no.1 of the bestselling book....Some kids got a headache called 'Harry Potter Headache' as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five, the biggest so far, at the same day without resting.And in Egypt, September the same year, the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records, first edition run out of the stores by the first week only, though it's nearly the beginning of the School year, and the movie of this 3rd book still filming. \u0650And the price of it get higher 20% in 2 days and still with increasing demand..More English books and novels sold in Egypt too, along with the Arabic ones, publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones, Alaa El Aswany's debut Novel 'Yaqubean's Building' making a very good selling numbers..\n\nAnd in  July 2004 the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands.January 2005 , an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt , specially that many already read the English edition before, so the publisher release an unabridged one by May.\n~~~~~~ ~~~~~~\nAnd on 21 July 2005, A Higher Record that breaks all the previously ones\n\n 6.9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only...A huge book, it may not be as the fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, Professor Snape. That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months..With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out, it followed by a massive variety of New Novels, New Series, New Authors..Twilight series, Percy Jackson series, and much more, more Books Sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..More Novels hit the top sales..A Real Prosperity.But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker...At the midnight before 21 June 2007, Everywhere around the Globe, the scene of thousands of people lining in front of Book Stores was repeated...even Bigger than any time before..A Huge Record for Pre-Orders online reach to One Million copies by Amazon only, and total sales of 11 millions copies in UK and US in the first day only.The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country..even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book Stores opened to receive and sell the book at the releasing day which was their holy Saturday, But it's Harry Potter after all, the world's most unusual, unexpected phenomenon and sales records breaker.And that's not bad, it was the Miracle of bringing back readers to Book Stores...And it's not just Harry Potter...Now, that \n'All was well.'\n , thousands of topics went online asking 'what to read next'....Indeed, although there's the e-books, e-readers..etc, still there's thousands of new books and novels published and sold every year , in every where in the world.The gaming devices is increasing? yes, But not as expected though by the 90s and early 2000s 'remember Nokia N-Gage?'.. but so does the reading devices which first come out by Sony in 2004,make big step by Amazon's Kindle in 2007...the ebook applications on every device.New books and series come after that, and still on, making super sales, attracting more readers... more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant. in UK, US , Egypt ..everywhere all over the globe..No matter a Playstation 4 is out, or new Xbox, the Books still there...with its most beloved magic.. The magic of books is back and , I believe, to stay..Don't you see with me that the magic of Harry Potter is one of the main factors of this magic?\n\u201cThis boy will be famous. There won\u2019t be a child in our world who doesn\u2019t know his name\u201d\nThat's what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book.. The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996..Well, what about now?God, Talked too much in the \"Brief\" introduction , didn't I?Well, that's it for this review... I guess some still think it's just the Propaganda that made that all....Well I'll try to prove them wrong by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series..Links will be here as soon as it'd done ..But for The First one... sorry to add one more , but 20000 characters aren't enough.The Ultimate Review of Book OneNow I'll be back to go around Hogwarts...

It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There\u2019s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won\u2019t find elsewhere. I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I\u2019ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I\u2019m really excited to experience the story \u201cfirst hand\u201d and see what all was left out from the films. I\u2019m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story. Not sure if I can say anything that hasn\u2019t been said before, but I loved it! Buddy read with Sam of Clues and Reviews! ", "I have absolutley no idea why goodreads deleted my review AND rating but thankfully I still had it saved! So here it is again, may it stick around this time! \u201dIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\u201dOkay, here\u2019s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it\u2019s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol* So I decided to make this a short \u201cmy thoughts about this book\u201d review. ;-P1.)\t\u201dThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him. 2.)\t\u201dAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry \u2013 yer a wizard.\u201dBless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD3.)\t\u201dBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d \u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mum.\u201dHaha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)4.)\t\u201dAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me.\u201dWhen I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I\u2019m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol* 5.)\t\u201dYou\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\u201dUrgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I\u2019ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he\u2019s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs* 6.)\t\u201dLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\u201dAnd here comes another character I\u2019ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he\u2019s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn\u2019t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry\u2019s father. Well done! ;-)7.)\t\u201dBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\u201dI still love that scene and I\u2019m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don\u2019t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don\u2019t get caught anymore. Haha! 8.)\t\u201dAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u201dLee Jordan is the best! <3 He\u2019s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant! 9.)\t\u201dIf I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side!\u201dI LOVE HARRY\u2019S DEFIANCE!!! That\u2019s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he\u2019s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he\u2019s going to be a great MC! And now let\u2019s move on and read book two! ;-)", "On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me, Number 14,577 is that they gave me, at 41 years old, the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series. When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn\u2019t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I\u2019d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it. However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I\u2019ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. It\u2019s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn\u2019t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry\u2019s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity\u2019s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he\u2019s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He\u2019s someone you can\u2019t help but like. He\u2019s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he\u2019s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. But that\u2019s not Harry. He\u2019s a better person than that. That\u2019s why we love him. Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let\u2019s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. I\u2019ll certainly settle for that. As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I\u2019m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don\u2019t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended. ", "How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?I have to get this right. As of this writing, I have 98 Goodreads friends. 61 (62%) of them have read J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Out of those who read this, 39 (64%) rated this with 5 stars. 11 of them with 4 stars. All the others gave 3 or 2. Only 2 rated this with 1 star. One of them admitted not being able to finish it. She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: \nI will never read Harry Potter\n.My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.These are what some of them say: it was a great book i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself.  Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.  Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.  I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.  Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards. Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book. I told you so! Why waste your time? . However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K. Rowling has it!My 39 friends are indeed right!", "ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) / ITALIANOLet me dream.I'm reading for the first time this book to my daughter (6 years old), but for me (37 years old) it's the third time I read \"Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone\". Everyone should read this book, if only to realize why the phenomenon \"Harry Potter\" has spread. With an essential and enjoyable style, J.K.

There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.\u275e\nEveryone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me. I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.\nThere is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\nI find it stupid of me to write a review for Harry Potter, especially being the first one. I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it. But still, I guess I can still write a review. Of course, my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else. Thoughts and opinions, nothing negative, maybe, maybe not. But, here goes nothing.Harry Potter is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names. Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful \"family\", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister. The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really. Well, she wasn't, besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants. Really though. There would be 36 presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them, he pouts and is upset because it's less than what he had the year before. DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILL!The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess, is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don't.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know. He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too. He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on. He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.His aunt, finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth, got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth. She wouldn't even mention her sister, because she pretended to not have one. She was considered perfect and brave, while she was nothing and unnoticed. Nothing has changed, but she didn't even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead, protecting Harry from wherever she is. And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest, he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr. Dursley \"forbids him.\" He can't do anything, since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change. When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like \"we get it.\" Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this \"You-Know-Who\" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.\nHumans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\nHarry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, \"Why the fuck did I not read this earlier?\" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young. PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say. It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring. It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness'. I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I've never watched the films. I've watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won't skip anything. It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. So will I, I should say. , Yes, I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end. Ron is honestly the cutest. I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I'm sure. I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.Malfoy Draco was someone I did not like, at all. Like I said, he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it. He showed off as well but in the bad way, thinking he was really cool just because he's in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is. He didn't show much care about Harry and his past, and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem. He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry. He was a newbie as well, so I don't see what the point was. But the other point is that I don't have expectations for Draco but I hope I don't end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change, at least slightly good.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes. The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it's no surprise. \nThere are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\nOverall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard.", "This book was okay. I didn't hate it or love it either way, though towards the end I realized how lukewarm I felt about the story since I would prefer to read any other book I had on hand. I appreciate the level of novelty in the world-building during the time this was first published. The friendship between the trio is cute. Hermione and Ron are fun characters and I might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists. Downsides: I cringed at the excessive fatphobia, anti-semitism, and the turban part. I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters. It felt like such an abrupt way to end the story... but TBH, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on to other books lol.", "As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ... HURRY UP ANNE!", "\nYes, I've been living under a rock.\n", "Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot. She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters...) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren't stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it's all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing. I will report back on book 2 when we're done. Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.....", "Can 35 Million Book Buyers Be Wrong? Yes.Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz,\" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is \"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken \"Tom Brown's School Days\" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of \"Harry Potter.\" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's \"The Wind in the Willows\" or the \"Alice\" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the \"perfectly normal\" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)----------------------------The first half of a little piece I wrote from the Journal in July 2000.

RowlingHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998.

It's a deep psychological mystery about the power of motherhood, the intensity of teenage love, and the danger of perfection. It moved me to tears.\" --Reese Witherspoon\"Extraordinary . . . books like Little Fires Everywhere don't come along often.\" --John GreenFrom the bestselling author of Everything I Never Told You, a riveting novel that traces the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives.In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned--from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood--and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.Named a Best Book of the Year by: People, The Washington Post, Bustle, Esquire, Southern Living, The Daily Beast, GQ, Entertainment Weekly, NPR, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Audible, Goodreads, Library Reads, Book of the Month, Paste, Kirkus Reviews, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and many more...Perfect for book clubs!

I can understand this dichotomy; I myself have certainly experienced suburbs where a high level of conformity seemed to be expected, resulting in a weird high-school atmosphere among grown adults. Still, you really don\u2019t have to dig very deep to realize that things aren\u2019t as black-and-white as they seem. There are all different kinds of people living everywhere, with varying degrees of happiness and fulfillment. All of which is to say, if you\u2019re going to write on this theme now, you should probably have something new to add to the conversation, or at least a unique way of expressing it.Little Fires Everywhere takes place in the planned community of Shaker Heights, where an artist named Mia and her teenage daughter Pearl move into a rental home after having lived a peripatetic existence since Pearl\u2019s birth. The battle lines are immediately drawn: the nonconformist, creative Mia versus the staid middle-aged matrons of Shaker Heights. Mind you, these battle lines aren\u2019t initially drawn by the characters, but by the author, who makes it clear that Mia is the moral center of the book. Characters who like Mia are the good characters; characters who don\u2019t like Mia are the bad characters; and characters who are suspicious of Mia at first and then come around to liking her have experienced a redemptive arc. This would be less problematic if Mia hadn\u2019t (view spoiler)[agreed to be a surrogate mother while in college, run off while still pregnant, forced her daughter to live a nomadic life in order not to blow her cover, and lied to her daughter the entire time, as well as keeping her from her grandparents and her biological father (hide spoiler)]. I was honestly horrified by Mia\u2019s actions and I wasn\u2019t brought around by the fact that she was an artist, or by the fact that she was allegedly the best mother since the Virgin Mary or whatever. But as far as this book is concerned, Mia is the real deal, an infinitely better person than all those Shaker Heights parents, who, let\u2019s face it, are all kind of repressed. Being repressed is the real sin of suburbanites, you see. Nothing could possibly be worse, I guess. Oh, there\u2019s also a subplot regarding a custody battle between a set of adoptive white Shaker Heights parents and the baby\u2019s biological mother, a young Chinese immigrant, which could have been really interesting, but it\u2019s given short shrift and is clearly meant only to underscore how amazing Mia is and how horrible the Shaker Heights mothers are in comparison.Now look, I don\u2019t expect any character to be perfect, and I did not expect that from the character of Mia. Obviously, someone in the novel needed to do something scandalous, or you\u2019d have no book at all. What I don\u2019t like is being told who to root for. I don\u2019t like it when authors stack the deck. Just present every character in the fullness of their humanity and let me decide who I\u2019m rooting for. If you\u2019ve done your job properly, I\u2019ll root for who you want me to root for anyway. But if you idealize one extremely flawed character at the expense of everyone else, you\u2019re going to lose me. You\u2019re going to make me side with a bunch of repressed Shaker Heights matrons I have nothing in common with, because those poor matrons never even had a chance at the end of your pen.Okay, so the nonconformist versus the suburbs theme wasn\u2019t handled in a particularly original or illuminating way here. It\u2019s possible the book could have been redeemed by good writing, except Little Fires Everywhere doesn\u2019t really have that either. The constantly shifting viewpoints didn\u2019t work for me at all\u2014and when I say constantly shifting, I don\u2019t mean chapter by chapter. I mean paragraph by paragraph, and sometimes sentence by sentence. This results in some extreme awkwardness, as when every sentence in a paragraph is from the point of view of the character of Izzy, except for one sentence in the middle that relays a piece of information that Izzy doesn\u2019t know. I guess an omniscient narrator is responsible for that particular sentence? In a few instances the omniscient narrator is even more obtrusive, reminding us who does and doesn\u2019t know certain things that have just occurred from one character\u2019s viewpoint. But beyond the awkwardness, so many characters are given a moment in the spotlight that I never really felt like I got to know most of them, and what we do know is revealed mainly through soliloquies and flashbacks, some of which are so long and involved that they derail the main story and quash any possible shot at narrative momentum. And let\u2019s not forget the eye-rollingly dramatic and implausible plot twists that make it seem as if the author has watched too much Grey\u2019s Anatomy. There\u2019s the college student who can\u2019t afford the year\u2019s tuition, and because she\u2019s (view spoiler)[\u201ctoo proud\u201d to accept a generous loan from her trusted mentor, and for some reason doesn\u2019t want to seek federal loans, she decides to become a surrogate mother instead. Makes sense! (hide spoiler)]. There\u2019s the character who is suspected of (view spoiler)[getting pregnant and then having an abortion, because she seemed to have gained weight, then vomited conspicuously, then by the next month had lost the weight. It turns out she had been stress-eating junk food (hence the weight gain), then got food poisoning (hence the vomiting), and then stopped eating due to stress (hence the weight loss). What a calamity of errors, am I right? (hide spoiler)] And then there\u2019s the beloved mentor who is of course (view spoiler)[diagnosed with a brain tumor and given weeks to live at precisely the time she\u2019s most needed. I guess at least it\u2019s good that she doesn\u2019t die in a car accident on an icy road\u2014but that\u2019s only because another character does fall victim to that clich\u00e9 a few months later. (hide spoiler)] There\u2019s just so much crammed into this book, but it all adds up to so little. This is all very awkward, because a representative of the publisher offered me this ARC a few weeks ago and I enthusiastically accepted. I hadn\u2019t read Celeste Ng\u2019s previous novel, but I was under the impression that she was a good writer and I thought I would really enjoy this one. But I didn\u2019t, and I have to be honest about it, because if I\u2019m not honest about the books I dislike, I can\u2019t expect anyone to trust my word on any book I review. Little Fires Everywhere seemed endless, it was pedestrian and tedious, and it just regurgitated stereotypes about the suburbs we\u2019ve all heard countless times before. I initially thought I would give it 2 stars because, even though I didn\u2019t like it, it seemed to me that the author had done what she\u2019d set out to do, and I wanted to acknowledge that. But by the time I reached the end of the book, I\u2019d changed my mind. It now seems to me that the author truly believes she\u2019s written something deeply meaningful, and I know this sounds harsh, but I don\u2019t agree. I learned nothing from this book and I didn\u2019t enjoy the experience. There\u2019s just no other way to say it.November 14, 2019. To people who loved this book: Thanks for reading to the end of my review! Please note that I read this book more than two years ago and, after all that time, I assure you nothing you can say about this book will suddenly change my mind about it. If you decide to comment anyway and are a jerk about it, rest assured I can give as good as I get, and I will most likely subsequently block you. If you can't handle people having opinions that differ from yours, don't read reviews that conflict with your opinions. It's that simple, and everyone else on Goodreads will thank you.", "\nAll her life, she had learned that passion, like fire, was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control.\n4 1/2 stars. You should go into this book expecting what it is: a slow-moving character portrait filled with complex family dynamics and small-town politics. If you know what this is, like with Ng's Everything I Never Told You, and don't go into it expecting fast-pacing and high-octane drama, you will probably find this quiet read to be extremely engrossing and emotional.I have to be in the mood for this kind of read, but when I am, it packs a powerful punch. These characters are so vivid, so real, so caught up in the little fires of everyday life in Shaker Heights. There's several stories going on in here, but the book begins with literal fires lighting up the Richardson household and the knowledge that the youngest daughter, Izzy, the wild card, has disappeared. Presumably because she is guilty of the arson.Then we move back from there. We start to get a portrait of the events leading up to this dramatic fire. We see the poor artist, Mia, and her daughter, Pearl, move into town and the effect they have on all members of the Richardson family. Further back, we get the past stories of almost every character who comes into this book. It is such a rich work in which the personal stories and experiences of secondary characters play a huge part in influencing how events unfold.And, behind it all, is a court case that will affect all the characters lives. A custody battle over a Chinese baby who could be given every toy, every desire, every opportunity by her rich and white adoptive parents - but is that all? Is that enough when her poor birth mother is ready and willing to care for her? Things become very tense. The town becomes divided. And I felt an emotional wreck by the end of it, too.\nMrs. Richardson, however, could not let Izzy be, and the feeling coalesced in all of them: Izzy pushing, her mother restraining, and after a time no one could remember how the dynamic had started, only that it had existed always.\nThe Richardson family, along with Mia and Pearl, Bebe, and the McCulloughs, all pulled me into their lives. I despised a character at one point, only to find pity for them a couple of chapters later. The relationship between Izzy and her mother was a real point of interest for me. How Mrs. Richardson's fears about Izzy affected her behaviour toward her, which in turn affected how Izzy behaved. All leading to the ultimate question: was Izzy always what Mrs. Richardson feared she was? Or did Mrs. Richardson create what she most feared through her treatment of Izzy?Little Fires Everywhere is a great example of how small character dynamics can create a powerful and fascinating story. I love the empathy the author shows for all the people in this book - even the manipulative, morally corrupt and undeserving. No one is merely good or bad. And that is what makes the book so effective. Whose side am I on? I'll let you know if I ever figure it out.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "*4.25 stars*Little Fires Everywhere is such an apt title for a novel that delves into the intricacies and angst that undoubtedly burns through some relationships\u2014maybe none more so than mother and daughter. At its core, this story explores the notion that being a mother doesn\u2019t mean being perfect; it comes down to love, sacrifice and sheer will. Through her cast of captivating characters, Celeste Ng confronts the reality that haunts us all\u2014each and every one of us is rife with cracks and flaws, no matter how well we hide it from prying eyes. That\u2019s just life.It\u2019s akin to pure magic when you pick up a book from an author you haven\u2019t read before\u2014I know, what\u2019s wrong with me? How did I miss Everything I Never Told You?\u2014and find yourself caught up in what can only be described as book nirvana. I had heard Celeste Ng\u2019s writing style was incredible, but I took that with a grain of salt\u2014merely an attempt on my part to avoid disappointment. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was this level of character development. This level of intricate detail and the multifaceted beings I wanted nothing more than to surround myself with.I have to admit, it was Mia that started out as my least favorite of the bunch. Her artsy-fartsy, gypsy-ways came off as incredibly selfish. A mother sacrificing any sense of stability for her daughter, in an attempt to chase her next inspiration, rubbed me the wrong way. How could she not stay in one place and let her incredibly smart daughter thrive?Then we meet Mrs. Richardson who\u2019s been hell-bent on living the life she laid out so perfectly in her mind. From most angles she has it all\u2014steady career, lovely home, successful husband, wealth and four children. A conundrum of sorts, she\u2019s tenacious, but still somehow oblivious. Initially, I wasn\u2019t really sure what to make of her or her motives\u2014was I reading more into things than I should?What binds these two very different women together is their teenage children who have their own fires burning between them and a custody battle that rocks their small town. The women end up on opposing sides of the equation, only working to further highlight their differences. The author juxtaposes these two women in many aspects\u2014but not overtly so\u2014and by the end, I was stunned.What struck me the most about this journey was the author\u2019s ability to change my entire perspective\u2014meaning, my thoughts and feelings in the beginning of the story were vastly different by the time I turned that final page. Some aspects ended on a sad note, but overall it was still a satisfying ending to what I can only describe as a fully immersive novel. I had the pleasure of reading this with the Traveling Sisters group; what a fun experience it turned out to be. Celeste Ng gave us plenty to discuss. Looking forward to the next read sisters. \u2665*Thank you to Penguin Press and Edelweiss for a copy in exchange for an honest review.", "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpress.com/\u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d is my first read by Celeste Ng, but I\u2019m pretty sure that it won\u2019t be my last. I could easily have read this book in just one or two sittings but life got in the way (in this case life being a glass of 7up, a knee jerk and \u201cNooo! Save the books!\u201d). But once the book was dry, I picked it up again and didn\u2019t stop until I finished the last page.Everything in Shaker Heights is planned and there are rules that residents must follow. Houses can only be painted certain colors (to ensure aesthetic harmony), garbage is never put out in front of the house, lawns must always be cut promptly, etc. The city motto says it all:\n\u201cMost communities just happen; the best are planned\u201d\nWhen Mia Warren and her fifteen year old daughter, Pearl rent a home from the Richardsons, a prominent Shaker Heights family \u2013 their lives will become intertwined in ways they never could have imagined.Mrs. Richardson liked to rent to people she felt were deserving of her help, people who may have had some tough turns in life. She felt it was her way of giving back. When she first meets Mia Warren and her daughter she thinks they are the perfect tenants.One of the Richardson boys, Moody is curious about the new tenants and heads over to the rental property. Moody and Pearl hit it off immediately. Moody who has never wanted for anything, is surprised at how this mother and daughter make their way. Mia can stretch a dollar (and leftover food) farther than anyone he\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s not long before Moody brings Pearl home to meet everyone. Soon Pearl is spending much of her time at the Richardson home. At first, everything is fantastic. Mrs. Richardson even hires Mia to do some housekeeping and cooking at the Richardson home. But it won\u2019t be long before the many differences between Mia and Mrs. Richardson cause a divide that will affect the two families in unimaginable ways.In some ways, I felt bad for Pearl as the nomadic life that her mother had them living would be hard on anyone, especially a teenage girl. However, Pearl also seemed to benefit from the way they lived. At first, Mia came across as incredibly selfish but it wasn\u2019t long before I loved her. Her caring ways were evident and how she responded to the different crises that came up endeared her to me. I may not have agreed with all of her choices but I could certainly see how she would have made them.Right off the bat I was irked by Mrs. Richardson (the fact that she was rarely referred to by her first name was fitting). Mrs. Richardson was the type who wanted to be seen as someone who cared and helped others. However, you could tell right away that she kept track of all the good things she had done. And you never knew when Mrs. Richardson would want a repayment of her \u201ckindness\u201d. When she offers to buy one of Mia\u2019s photographs and Mia doesn\u2019t fall at her feet with gratitude...\n\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you.\u201d Mia\u2019s eyes slid toward the window briefly and Mrs. Richardson felt a twinge of irritation at this lukewarm response to her philanthropy. \nIzzy was a firecracker and I adored her impulsiveness and strong feelings about right and wrong. Even at ten years old, setting shelter cats free \n\u201cThey\u2019re like prisoners on death row\u201d\n, her refusal to conform was thrilling. Mrs. Pissers and the toothpick incident had me giggling. And I hurried to Google to search \u201cThis Be The Verse\u201d by Philip Larkin.There was a lot going on in \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d but I found it easy to keep up. I will say that it had a bit of a slow start but I feel the author was just setting the stage for all that was to come. And once I hit the halfway mark, I was so completely invested into all of their lives and HAD to know what was going to happen next.The additional story-line of little Mirabelle McCullough/May Ling Chow\u2019s adoption was incredibly thought provoking and had me asking myself some hard questions. I honestly didn\u2019t know which side I was on half the time. My head was spinning.\n \u201cWhat made someone a mother? Was it biology alone, or was it love?\u201d\nI thought that the development of the characters was fantastic. With so many characters and only so many pages, it takes skill to bring them all to life. And in my opinion; Celeste Ng did a phenomenal job. And with the many 90\u2019s references such as Sir-Mix-a-lot, Smashing Pumpkins, Jerry Springer, and Monica Lewinsky - I was taken back to my own adolescence.This was an intriguing and compelling domestic drama. A story about motherhood, adolescence, race, rules, right and wrong, and so much more. Great characters and an interesting plot made \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d a fast and fantastic read. Many thanks go to Penguin Press for providing a copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review.", "\nmy LORD i truly enjoyed this. there were a few minor things with the pacing that i would have changed just a smidge, and it didn't impact me quite as much as ng's debut, but this was beautiful and wonderful in its own way. i am SO excited for the adaptation. also, i can safely say now that celeste ng is one of my favorite authors and the next thing that she writes cannot come quickly enough.read!! this! book!!!\n", "Dang!If this book does not get your brain churning, well, then you did not read the same book I just did!This book is filled with so many scenarios with so many questions and no perfect answers. Every situation is a little pile of kindling and any of the questionable solutions will only ignite the fire . . . soon you have a bunch of fires ready to burn everything to the ground. Man, that would be a great title for this book! Oh . . . wait . . .It has been a long time since I remember reading a book where my mind and problem solving skills have been this challenged. Usually when you are reading you think, \"well, the best route for them to follow is this\" or \"Geez, it's obvious that they should never have done that.\" In this book I just kept thinking, \"I am glad I am not the one who has to make any of these decisions!\"Also, this book is full of so many misunderstandings. I get frustrated when someone is falsely accused or the wrong conclusion is assumed. Every 15 minutes I found myself yelling at this book! \"IT WASN'T HER!\" \"NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! SOMEONE SPEAK UP!\"\"OH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO END WELL!\"I believe I have said it before, but any time a book has you engaged so much you yell at it, want to pull the characters out of the pages and shake them, and/or need a stiff drink to calm your nerves at the end of each chapter, you are reading a pretty darn good book.Give your analytical side a gift and read this book - it would be a great one for a book club. I imagine it would certainly lead to some lively discussion!", "\n\n\u201cMost of the time, everyone deserves more than one chance. We all do things we regret now and then. You just have to carry them with you.\u201d\n\nNever in my life have I read any book, any narrative, that cared \nas deeply for all of its characters as this one did.\n Little Fires Everywhere lives in the grey area, leaving it impossible not to be invested, impossible not to love every character and cry for every character and root for every character, despite all their flaws. I really struggle to characterize this book; it\u2019s sort of a combination between a mystery and literary fiction, and will probably work best for you if you\u2019re a fan of both? Little Fires Everywhere is a very slow-burn story about a small town thrown into disarray by a court dispute. When an Asian baby given up by her mother is adopted by a white family, it causes a spiral of events that lead to a scene of a house on fire and a family driven away.I think I\u2019ve already expressed this, but this book is.... a masterpiece. It\u2019s one of those books that I finished and then was just on my bed tearing up because it\u2019s so well-crafted. The reason this book is so fantastic is primarily structural; we see the end, and then we go back and see the beginning. But anyway, the reason this book works so well is the characterization. There is so much to appreciate here. I like that Moody is sort of written as the stereotypical jilted nice guy, and and then we see more nuance to that characterization. I loved the complexity of the dynamic between poor characters and rich characters; I loved how no character is black and white, but they have definition nonetheless. Of the approximately-eleven-person main cast, Izzy is my absolute favorite. Izzy is a ridiculously relatable character for me personally mainly through her relationship with her mom. There\u2019s a line somewhere where Izzy says she thinks her mother sees her as such a demon that all her actions are framed in that light - that was me. And that is still me in my relationship with one of my parents. The degree to which the narrative of this book validates her trauma and her feelings is incredible.And on another very personal note, Mia\u2026 kind of reminds me of my other parent. So some of you who follow me on this platform might now that my mom and I are really, really close, and I grew up with her as my main support system. And I think\u2026 her relationship with Izzy just felt so personal to me for that reason. So maybe this was too personal a read for me, but I\u2019m going to be honest: it\u2019s my belief that reading is something that is meant to be personal. And maybe the degree to which this personally affected me is the most important part of all.There\u2019s a scene within this book that has stuck with me since the beginning, in which the adoptive mother of the baby is asked how she plans to incorporate Chinese culture into the life of the baby, and she brings up \u201coriental rugs\u201d and how she gives the baby rice. And it\u2019s this awful moment, because we know she loves that baby. We do. But in that moment she becomes the persecutor of her own child. She does not understand, and so she perpetrates a culture that has been trying to swallow up her child. I think that\u2019s what this book is about, in the end; the degrees to which we can hurt people without ever attempting to, the way we can ruin lives through looking for our own happiness. This book was masterful. And I hope you all read it. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube", "I pre-ordered this book months ago. It arrived at 12:01am today. I've been reading non - stop.... a one- sitting read with a few necessity breaks. Here's is my problem.... I feel as if I've read this story before. I was only mildly interested in many scenes. There were parts I found trite and parts I found semi boring. Personally - I found the characters to be very one dimensional. Here's another problem I have:Yesterday I finished reading \"In The Fall They Come Back\", by Robert Bausch. I saw a lot of similarities in these two books, but this novel didn't 'wow' me nearly as much. This story 'seemed' like it had all the elements I usually love ..... The wealthy and thrifty battle it out...plus moral issues to think about ...but my heart wasn't always in it. Not sure why. It could be me. For one thing..... I spent summers in Shaker Heights .... I felt this book could have been written anywhere. Plus.... I'm not sure I appreciated some of the stereotyping of this community.BUT ....here's a small flavor of the characters you'll spend time with: 'The Richardson's family': Bill is an attorney and drives a BMW SedanElena is a wife & mom..... works for the local newspaper: 'Sun Press'. She drives a LexusTHE FOUR SIBLINGS:Lexie -senior drives an explorer- has the lead in her School play. Seems fruity & shallow at times - but is an excellent student Trip - a junior - drives a jeep - loves sports - handsome -fit --and charming Moody - sophomore- rides a bike ( bless him) - most compassionate- very bright -introspective Izzy - Freshman- considered black sheep of the bunch - feels different than others in her family. 'The Warren's: They recently moved into a rental ( a duplex) that the Richardsons own. Mia- 36 years old, single mom, artist. Mia drives a VW Rabbit. She would rather mop floors any day- quietly alone- than have to wait on customers. Pearl -15 years old - Mia's daughter - shy - honors student - Paul, my husband, is rushing me - he says RETIRE.... lol.....So.....I LIKED IT.....but..... after several great books I've recently read, I can't say I'm 'wild' about it. It was ok!!! - alright - better than OK!Worth reading! Others may love it! 3.6 stars", "I'd rate this 3.5 stars. (I know, it's killing me, too.)Sometimes one of my greatest frustrations with books I read is that it is difficult for me to believe that a character would do something egregious as a knee-jerk reaction to something they don't agree with. I know, I'm reading fiction, which isn't always directly based on real life, but sometimes a character's actions are so ridiculous and ring so false that they really change my feelings about a book.Other times a character is so unlikable (although you may discover it's all an act) that they're just so off-putting, and they detract from the book's appeal.Both things happened for me while reading Celeste Ng's new book, \nLittle Fires Everywhere\n, and I'm so disappointed, because I wanted to love it. While I found much of the book simply beautiful, the plot\u2014and one character\u2014travel down a path that I found a little too far-fetched and irritating that it spoiled how I felt.To someone on the outside looking in, the Richardson family seems like the quintessential Shaker Heights, Ohio family\u2014two successful and driven parents, four good-looking children, sure to follow in their parents' footsteps. The perception isn't all false\u2014Elena Richardson, who returned to her hometown after college to raise a family, is a reporter for the local paper; her husband is a successful attorney. Their children, each one year apart, are each popular and successful in their own way, except the youngest, Izzy, who has a knack for standing out, especially if it means pushing her mother's buttons.When Mia Warren, an enigmatic, slightly bohemian artist, and her daughter Pearl arrive in Shaker Heights, and move into the Richardsons' rental apartment, the family quickly falls under their spell. Pearl, who has moved more times than she can count, always on her mother's whim, has finally extracted a promise from Mia that they will stay in Shaker Heights, and she is excited to finally be able to make friends and cement relationships instead of biding her time until she leaves town again.Pearl and the Richardsons' younger son, Moody, become close friends, although quickly she becomes a part of the family. Mia, too, in addition to working on her art, begins working for the Richardsons, becoming an unexpected confidante for older daughter Lexie, and forging a relationship with Izzy that she can't have with her mother. But Mia is also wary of the Richardsons and doesn't quite trust that all is as perfect as it seems.When a custody battle involving one of Elena's oldest friends becomes fodder for the media, everyone in town has an opinion. Elena discovers that she and Mia are on opposite sides of this fight, which causes Elena to view Mia with suspicion. Suddenly she feels the need to find more about this mysterious woman who holds her family in her thrall, and Elena doesn't realize\u2014or care, really\u2014about what damage the truth may cause, for everyone.\"All her life, she had learned that passion, like fire, was a dangerous thing. It so easily went out of control. It scaled walls and jumped over trenches. Sparks leapt like fleas and spread as rapidly; a breeze could carry embers for miles. Better to control that spark and pass it carefully from one generation to the next, like an Olympic torch. Or, perhaps, to tend it carefully like an eternal flame: a reminder of light and goodness that would never\u2014could never\u2014set anything ablaze. Carefully controlled. Domesticated. Happy in captivity. The key, she thought, was to avoid conflagration.\"\nLittle Fires Everywhere\n is a powerful meditation on motherhood and the sometimes-tenuous bond between mother and child. It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets, misunderstandings, and miscommunication, and how easily problems could be avoided if people would just say what they thought, or speak up rather than let a person roll over them. At its most poignant, this is a book about the damage that can be done by neglect or mistreatment, even when it's unintended, and how finding someone who seems to care about you can be a life-changing force.Ng is a storyteller with such quiet power. As she did in her spectacular first novel, \nEverything I Never Told You\n, she captures the routine and dramatic moments in a family's life, uncovering just how much goes on underneath the silences. While I appreciate her fearlessness in creating unappealing characters, I really was unhappy with some of her choices, which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the plot, but they just seemed so ludicrous (and in one case, just a wee bit convenient and predictable) that one character and her treatment of others became almost one-dimensional.I've seen many glowingly positive reviews of this book, so I wouldn't let my criticisms dissuade you from reading it if it interests you. Ng is an immense talent, and I look forward to seeing what's next for her. If you do read this, I would love to talk to you after you're finished, to see what you thought about the things that frustrated me.

It\u2019s good; parts are excellent, others not so much. I liked Mia\u2019s backstory as she became an artist using experimental photography. I thought that the custody dispute concerning \u201cOriental Barbie\u201d was worth at least a star or two.A lot of the characters are clich\u00e9d. The at-home Mr. Richardson could be a cardboard cutout with excellent earning skills. He fairs a lot better before the judge. The Richardson children fit into \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d well. A jock, a popular girl, a smart kid and Izzy who may well be a transgendered Holden Caulfield (thank you to my GR friend, Bill Kupersmith), but I liked her a lot more than that wretched boy. So yeah, the Richardson\u2019s have a child for each grade in high-school. Mrs. Richardson produced four singletons in roughly as many years. While in other respects, she is a perfect match for her orderly and rule-bound community. The rapid-fire baby production seemed reckless and out of place. It is the only part of her character that jibbed with aggressively investigating her tenant and employee\u2019s past. Opening a \u2018can of worms\u2019 and a house full of screaming babies being equally disordered and unpredictable.I don\u2019t believe that she is meant to be likable. She approaches friendship with same calculation as Claire Underwood with a careful tally of every kindness. But, as she is central to the book, I wish she were plausible. Even if she were perfectly constructed, the story is still awfully scattered.My son heard part of the book while we were driving over the holidays. When we stopped, he would say \u201cSo\u201d and give a one-sentence summary of the upcoming section or chapter. I don\u2019t believe he has any preternatural gifts as plot savant. A lot of the story is pretty predictable.I have a quibble about that car. Is that the same VW rabbit Mia\u2019s brother bought when they were teenagers? If so, how did she manage vehicle maintenance on minimum wage earnings supplemented by occasionally selling a piece of art? Twenty to thirty years of use is aging NASA spacecraft territory, but this car starts reliably, runs well over long distances, and doesn\u2019t need any repairs. It seems oddly out of place given the careful mathematics of Bebe\u2019s poverty.P.S. I stand corrected my son says he is too a plot savant.", "I think it's safe to say that I'll read everything Celeste Ng ever writes.Just like in a mystery book, you have to work at getting to the root of her stories. She doesn't hand you the plot from the get-go, but instead offers you kernels of the story until everything comes together at the very end. Although this can lead to frustration or boredom, especially with the sometimes barebones plot, I loved it.I'm very much a character-focused reader, and this was very much a character-focused novel. There's not much action driving this book forward. It's slow paced, but this gives us the time to dive deeper into the nuances of the complicated situation these characters are placed into. By examining from all sides, we are shown how both humans and their choices are complicated.If you like character studies, complex relationships, and a '90s suburban setting, please pick this up!", "When I read Celeste Ng's debut novel \nEverything I Never Told You\n in late 2014, I was smitten. Ng's writing was so beautiful, her characters so real, and the story so compelling. I instantly knew I would be reading whatever she put out next.Three years later and I'm happy to say that Ng has returned with just as stunning of a novel as her debut. Little Fires Everywhere is hands down one of the best books I've read this year; and just like its predecessor will be rising to the top of my yearly favorites list.I don't want to say too much about this novel because with Ng's books, I've discovered, it's best to go in anticipating very little and being surprised along the way. Because she is very good at surprises\u2014and not the kind of plot twists you'll read in a thriller or spy novel; the kind of surprises that sneak up on you in real life and seem to tear your world apart. Her novels are domestic, but they aren't quaint. They have a raw, emotional power to them that are especially drawn out by her incredibly crafted characters. The inner turmoil is just as important as the external conflict in her stories, and that makes for a compulsively readable, yet immensely relatable read. You can empathize with so many parties in her stories, and this one is no exception. To me, these characters jumped from the pages; they have the mannerism (she's so observant, akin to Adichie in that sense) and the motivations of people you know in your own life. Mrs. Richardson's ethics and worldview are as real and as contrary as Mia's artistic sentiments. And you can't help feeling for both of them at times. That's what makes this story so good\u2014there is no black and white, despite the obviously drawn lines between the differing characters. Ng exists in the grey, and her mission, it seems to me, is to pull you in to the grey too and think about how murky and complicated and messy life is.I'll stop gushing, but only as long as people go pick this up and read it (along with her first novel too)! Ng is surely one of my favorite living writers, and, again, I can't wait to see what she does next.", "\n\u2018all her life, she had learned that passion, like fire, was a dangerous thing. it so easily went out of control.\u2019\ni honestly wasnt expecting to enjoy this book. i didnt really like celeste ngs debut and i thought this was probably overhyped. but this is one of the few occasions where i am actually happy to admit i was wrong. i knew from the first chapter, where the title comes into play, that i was in for a real treat. if you dont know by now, i love when a book is so aptly named. sometimes titles can come across as lazy or appear as an afterthought, so there is nothing i love more than when a title is given some meaning and depth. and this book does that perfectly. i love how this book explores so many themes - such as motherhood, race, friendship, community, children - each one a little fire that slowly burned into an explosion of a story. i think ng is so clever in how she likens so many topics to a fire, bright with a burning intensity and heat. but with fire and scorched earth can come new beginnings. izzys character is definitely the highlight for me. i loved seeing her come to accept this idea and burn her own way, blazing a path of her own choosing. i know this wont be a book for everyone due to its slow pace and prominent focus on character histories, but there is definitely a reason this book is so highly rated. and i am very relieved that i enjoyed such a great work of fiction.\u21a0 4.5 stars", "My favorite part of this book was the part when I deposited my still-pristine hardcover copy, unblemished BOTM Club bookmark and all, into the Little Free Library down the street - knowing that although I did not much enjoy the book, I am one of approximately 998 readers in that regard, and therefore my little free deposit would hopefully confer lotta free joy on someone else.I didn't hate this book at first; rather, the dislike gradually seeped up on me, like Little Gripes Everywhere! My admired GR friend Debbie uses the concept of a Complaint Board in her wonderful reviews, and I really had the Complaint Board experience with this one. It was as though I was standing in front of that bulletin board at the Whole Foods where people are all like, \"NO COCONUT CHIA PODS PAST TWO WEEKS WTF!\" Only for me it was more like, \"THIS IS MASQUERADING AS A CHARACTER-DRIVEN NOVEL WHEN IT'S REALLY PLOT-DRIVEN AF WHAT THE HELL?\"So, initially I had decided to keep my negative Nellie thoughts to myself, but I'll share a couple...lest they become everything I never told you (lol lol!)Gripe 1: What I said on the Complaint Board above: I think by literary fiction standards, this book was way too concerned with jerking the plot around in different directions and became clunky and mechanical in so doing. As other reviews have observed, this also often relies on the reader having to swallow repeated farfetched coincidences, which I will not enumerate to avoid spoilers, and also because they are annoying and absurd.Gripe 2: Related: Now, I liked Everything I Never Told You (the first book I ever reviewed on Goodreads! And very positively!) and would definitely call that a character-driven novel, which by definition requires very well-developed characters. The reader needs a very clear understanding of not just the things a character is doing or has done, but more importantly, what the character is thinking and how they are thinking it - and as they alone are capable of thinking.In my opinion, in contrast, LFE is only a character-driven novel if you accept as the definition of a character-driven novel \"a novel with some characters in it, who do some stuff.\" I didn't find the voices - internal or external - differentiated at all. I feel like I could read aloud a quote or a thought from each character and it would be difficult to guess who it was. Everyone was super superficially portrayed: the four kids were a kind of Breakfast Club cast of characters without any of the John Hughes wit, etc. Gripe 3: Some other reviewers have already noted that they felt manipulated by the book, that it seemed clear that the author was yanking around the puppet strings in order to gesture toward whom the reader was supposed to like, dislike, and root for. I would have to agree with this; I felt that the author should have trusted us more instead of nudging us in different directions - for example, by phoning it in with the characterization of certain characters so that they have all the subtlety of Cruella de Ville. I was also really put off by the whole Manic Pixie Dream Artist Mom thing going on with Mia, whom, as many others have noted, seems to be set up as the hero of the book. And ugh, the ending, with the four envelopes - for me that was so saccharine that I seriously wanted to vomit. In short - wow, I really liked this author's first book, and this one was so different and really suffered in comparison. It really felt like a sophomore slump to me, or an early draft. Her debut was pretty risky and daring, while this one sort of played it safe to the point of becoming formulaic. Reading this book often felt to me like trying to play dolls with a young child and having to just unquestioningly accept the illogical and despotic rules of their universe.Side note: It didn't help that I read The Leavers recently - check that one out for a more complex and nuanced examination of issues around cross-cultural adoption. And for your more general making-peace-with mom issues (among many other things), The Animators is another suggestion I'd offer. A richer depiction of artists as well - some manic maybe, but manic pixie-free!", "5 Amazing Bright Shiny Stars! I would give it 100 if Goodreads would let me. Little Fires Everywhere is a novel that far surpasses any other that I have ever read.  I don't know how Celeste Ng did it. It is a brilliantly written novel with intricate, rich and wholly vivid characters whose lives are so fully intertwined you can't help but read on in bewildered awe of how Celeste Ng created these characters. My nerve endings were fully engaged on high alert from the first sentence.Shaker Heights, Ohio is an affluent town with rules and regulations like no other. Mrs. Richardson lives by them, having been raised by them and she has raised her four children (Lexie, Trip, Moody and Izzy) to abide by them as well. She rents a little apartment in Shaker Heights to Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl, who are less fortunate. Mia is a free spirited artist, who lives life to the fullest. These women have one thing in common and one thing only: they love their children immensely and they accept each other's as their own. Mia (or rather Ms. Ng) describes it beautifully: \"To a parent, your child wasn't just a person, your child was a place, a kind of Narnia, a vast eternal place where the present you were living and the past you remembered and the future you longed for all existed at once. You could see it every time you looked at her; layered in her face was the baby she'd been and the child she'd become and the adult she would grow up to be and you saw them all simultaneously, like a 3-D image. It made your head spin. It was like a place you could take refuge, if you knew how to get in. And each time you left it, each time your child passed out of your sight, you feared you might never be able to return to that place again.\" Neither live perfect lives, sometimes in fact they make grave mistakes, yet their love for their children never falters. These mothers relationships with each other, their family and everyone in town is threatened when a custody battle ensues between a friend of the Richardsons, Mrs. and Mr. McCullough, who are in the middle of adopting a Chinese American baby and a friend of Mia's, Bebe, who is the birth mother. This battle wrecks havoc on the town and causes incredible strife between the families. This novel is captivating and crazy compelling. These characters burn an indelible image onto your soul.  The character of Izzy, Mrs. Richardson's daughter had me from the beginning (kind of like Hannah from Ms. Ng's Everything I Never Told You - which I also loved). Izzy has a strength and over came odds that most children in her position wouldn't. Her triumphs made my heart soar. Somehow Ms. Ng made me change my mind about some of the characters throughout the course of this novel. In the beginning, I felt one way about two of the characters and then by the end, I did a complete switcheroo, and my feelings about them were FIERCE. Little Fires everywhere brought forth laughter and lots of tears. It is that kind of novel. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is captivating, compelling and full of heart and soul. Celeste Ng's ability to intertwine the characters and storylines was wondrous, brilliant and beautiful. I loved every second of this book.  It has now topped my list as my FAVORITE BOOK of ALL TIME. Little Fires Everywhere was a Traveling Sister Group Read and included Brenda, Norma, Jennifer, Holly, Melissa & Kendall. We all had a fabulous time reading this one together - the group discussions for this incredible read were amazing and I look forward to our next read together. For the full Traveling Sisters Group Review, please see Norma and Brenda's Blog:https://www.twogirlslostinacouleeread...Thank you to Edelweiss, Penguin Press and Celeste Ng for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Published on Goodreads, Edelweiss and Amazon on 9.17.17.", "There are some books when you finish, you just sit motionless with blank face, feeling speechless, resuming your awkward position for hours and then you turn back into your life after getting frozen by a magical dramatic literary wand\u2019s power. That\u2019s what happened to me. And I realized I haven\u2019t written any word about this stunning, amazing book and now Witherspoon and Washington\u2019s Hulu series are about to stream in a month, (I checked the trailer and it looks promising thankfully. I am still not happy about Big Little Lies\u2019 adaptation.) I decided add my opinions. So here we go: this book is character driven, slow burn drama which will help a lot turn into series to give us so much details and realistic portraits about characters, always works well for me. Small town dynamics, dysfunctional family issues, class differences, morality about a child\u2019s own destiny, hypocrisy, lies, secrets mixing each other and slow-building tension rises at the end with powerful, thought- provoking, twisty ending leaves you speechless. Welcome to Shaker Heights! Richardson household is burning into fire and their daughter Izzy is nowhere to be seen. She might be responsible of this chaos. Then we slowly going back and forth between the snippets of Richardson family\u2019s relationship with poor artist Mia and her daughter Pearl who became their tenants and afterwards. And behind their story, there is custody war over a Chinese baby\u2019s adoption by Richardson family\u2019s close friends. Should baby be adopted by people who are so rich and ready to present her every opportunity she\u2019s dreamed of or should her biological mother take the custody even though they may suffer from poorness and financial struggles? Unhealthy, ballistic relationship with Izzy and her mother and striking differences between Mia and Elena and too many lies and secrets\u2019 revelations change everything in their lives. When the fire starts to destroy everything they had in their lives, they need to start from scratch and learn from their mistakes. It\u2019s powerful, emotional, questioning, unique story. I know it\u2019s so challenging to pick a side because nobody is blameless and innocent. I hope we see a good adaption without losing the essence of the story and its well-crafted characterization.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "The Richardson family lives a perfect life, planned to a T and that's what Elena Richardson, her husband and four children seem to have, at least to fifteen year old Pearl Warren. Pearl moves with her itinerant artist mother, Mia, into a rental house owned by the Richardsons in Shaker Heights and becomes infatuated with this family, their house, their life style so different from her own and is mostly infatuated with three of the teenage siblings. The reader though knows from the get go that there's no perfection here . An awful thing happens to this family and we know what it is from the first sentence but I won't give it away. The Shaker Heights motto is: \"Most communities just happen; the best are planned \" : the underlying philosophy being that everything could - and should- be planned out, and that by doing so you could avoid the unseemly, the unpleasant, and the disastrous.\" The truth is that life happens and no matter what - things cannot be avoided and what happens here defies this underlying philosophy. But this is not the most awful thing that happens in this family. For me it was the dysfunctional relationship that Elena has with her youngest daughter Izzy . Izzy reminds me in some ways of Hannah in Ng's last book, Everything I Never Told You. Unlike Hannah, Izzy is not invisible not totally ignored, but she is picked on, made fun of and seems to always be the recipient of her mother's impatience with things that are not perfect. Theirs is not the only mother-daughter relationship that Ng focuses on . There is Mia and Pearl, who move from place to place, with Pearl not knowing the reason why or who her father was. There is Bebe, Mia's coworker, and her newborn baby May-Ling that she abandons and then fights to get custody. Bebe's story at first seems secondary but it ends up being the impetus for Elena's almost obsessive search to find out Mia's past. Ng delves deep into her characters and you feel you know them inside and out even though it takes until the end to fully understand Elena and Izzy. You may not like all of them but you will understand them . This I find to be Ng's strength as a writer- how she makes us know her characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the novel, is when the Richardsons find the photographs that Mia leaves for them. She came to know them too . Definitely recommended to those who were fans of Everything I Never Told You, and stories of families who are less than perfect, which I'm sure many of us can relate to.  I received an advanced copy of this book from Penguin Publishing Group through Edelweiss.The book links are not working for me now but I'll try again later to insert them. ", "Metaphorically speaking, everyone has 'little fires' in their lives - events that begin as a small spark, and have the ability to transform into a raging inferno, changing lives for ever.Shaker Heights, Cleveland is an idyllic place to live, everything has been planned to create the perfect community, but it's residents are expected to live by its many rules and regulations.The Richardson's are quintessentially the kind of family who the community of Shaker Heights was built for. Elena Richardson was brought up with these rules, and she and her husband are determined that their four children, Lexie, Trip, Moody and Izzy will live by them too. Izzy isn't exactly a chip off the old block though, and will prove to be very disruptive.The Richardson's rent out an apartment to people they feel need a helping hand, and their latest tenants are Mia and her daughter Pearl. Mia is a free spirit, an artist specialising in photography, and when Elena\u2019s troublesome daughter Izzy becomes close to Mia, Elena finds that she's jealous of the relationship, a relationship that doesn't exist between her and Izzy. Further to this, an adoption case in the community puts Elena and Mia on opposing sides, and Elena decides to do some digging on Mia\u2019s past, and uproots some secrets that will change everything. Oh gosh, this book explores so many issues, but for me the one that stood out was motherhood, and in particular, the relationship between mothers and daughters, from baby's early days to teenage angst. It was beautifully written, with characters so well developed I felt as if I knew them personally. I also liked the setting of Shaker Heights, a place so perfect and orderly, and yet, ultimately there is always someone who will rip up those precious rules and regulations and throw them in the garbage. Celeste Ng writes with great insight and empathy, and leaves the reader with much to think about.*Thank you to Netgalley and Little, Brown Book Group for my ARC in exchange for an honest review*", "\nI wouldn't even know where to begin to try and review this one. Holy fuck.\n", "\n4.5 It's my first novel by Celeste Ng and even though Literary Fiction/Contemporary isn't my genre, I really enjoyed this one. I now have to pick up \"Everything I Never Told You\" which has been on my shelves for way too long!Would recommend if you're looking for a slow character driven book full of emotions!\n", "At first glance, this book seems to be mostly about teenagers, but then it struck me that it\u2019s really about parenting. Each parent thinks they\u2019re doing the right things in the way they raise their children. But who truly is?  Ng does a good job of bringing each character to life. Izzy is the most unique of the characters. And the relationship between Izzy and Mrs. Richardson is spot on perfect. \u201cWhen it came to Izzy, Mrs. Richardson was seldom calm, and for that matter, Izzy herself never was.\u201d There are multiple storylines here, all equally fascinating. The one that grabbed me the most was between Bebe Chow and the McCulloughs. I flip flopped back and forth between whose side I was on. The heartache of both sides was palpable. It took a while for the book to truly grab me. But once it did, it really did. The title is so apt. Not just the physical fire, but the fires that burn within the characters, especially the fire that ignited in Mrs. Richardson. It\u2019s interesting that the author refers to Mrs. Richardson by her formal name, whereas everyone else is called by their first name. It suits her perfectly, as she is such a stickler for tradition and following the rules. This is a fascinating book with a lot going for it. Five rich stars!Update - both of my book clubs had this as their selection this month. In both cases, the discussions were great. Any clubs looking for ideas, I highly recommend. ", "\nIntensely complex, multi layered, and intricately plotted Little Fires Everywhere is a profoundly complicated and jarring read about motherhood, freedom, and the human experience. \nWhen unconventional artist Mia and her fifteen year old daughter, Pearl, move to Shaker Heights, Ohio their lives dramatically change. Of even great significance is their impact on the seemingly perfect Richardson family. On the surface, the Richardson\u2019s seem to have it all--perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect children (minus one), but something is missing. Living in the bubble of the cookie cutter community of Shaker Heights, their world is insular and small. Mia and Pearl\u2019s presence shakes them to the core and opens them up to a world of new possibilities. Told through the eyes of multiple characters, this is a slow burn read with fluid changes of POV. While one of the main events occurs in the first chapter, it isn't until the end that one can fully understand the implications of \"the little fires everywhere.\"Here\u2019s the thing--when I first started reading this, I had a hard time connecting to the characters and the plot. Several times I wanted to give up and start another book, but Ng\u2019s beautiful writing kept pulling me back in. It wasn\u2019t until about half way through, I felt the subtle spark of connection, and as it grew my feelings about this book grew. When I got to the end, I was simply stunned by how this book snuck up on me and overpowered my emotions. To sum up my reading experience: \u201cAnd it was complicated, what had happened. It was a terribly awkward agonizingly slow, painfully intimate story that unfolded.\u201d ", "An author that has the uncanny ability and insight to look deep inside the workings of the often complicated relationships between mothers and daughters. Mrs. Richardson prides herself on always following the rules, believing if this is done success in life and family will follow. She has four children , but as we know saying it doesn't make it so. Mia, a single mother, has a secret, a secret that will be used to her detriment. She was my favorite character, has a better, closer bond with her daughter, Pearl, but mother's know, teenage daughter keep secrets too. A friend of Mrs Richardson, is unable to have children, but is given an opportunity that may not be hers to take.What an absolutely perfect title this was, small fires trailing these characters in their actions, words and the things they keep hidden. The way the story progresses, unravels, is brilliant, completely right. The different lifestyles, but always at heart is the question, \"Nature vs. nurture, does lifestyle matter if the love is strong?\" Unbreakable bonds, forged in many different ways. Sometimes by the time we have full realization of something important, it may be too late.This novel does something important, it makes one think, might make some open their eyes.

Which is so biased because SHE'S THE LEAD OF THE SHOW!***************With Reese Witherspoon!!!!!***************YOU GUYS!! THEY'RE MAKING THIS A TV SHOW!

It's like the way a frosted sunrise (basically ice cream and orange juice blended to perfection.) tastes both sour and sweet all at the same time.This book could never be a movie. I'm not saying that negatively. No, I would absolutely love to see this in the big screen but it's just written in such an amazing and unique way that only a book can portray. This book is told in third person omniscient. This basically means it's told in he/she/they but from the POV of everyone. Kind of. It's almost like inside out where one moment were in one characters head and then we switch to another. For instance, there is a major problem in the plot and the reader is completely for one side and then BOOM! POV switch and suddenly your on the other side. The whole book pushes and pulls the reader back and forth. And that's what I loved about it. It was so unique so moving and so full of joy and sorrow.Of course, it's this aspect that would be nearly impossible to make into a movie. Not that it can't be done.

Don\u2019t worry, I kicked myself already!Celeste Ng\u2019s words are beyond captivating. She has, for me, created one of the best character driven stories ever. I\u2019m not going to bother telling you what the plot is about. Go find out for yourself! You\u2019re welcome! I\u2019m serious, you are welcome!As soon as I started reading, the writing drew me in. She is a master at letting the writing speak for itself. The mystery? It came from her writing. The intriguing plot? The writing. The conflict I was experiencing? The writing. The characters that I felt I knew to my core and actually existed for me? The flippin\u2019 writing did it all. I kept on rereading a sentence because I felt that I could extract more meaning, more magic from it. I was relishing in it, holding it close for a while before I moved on to the next sentence and let it go. But then I stumbled across one of those magical sentences again and the cycle started all over again. As for the characters, well, they were a treat. In the sense that if you enjoy reading characters that\u2019ve been well-developed, that are layered, nuanced, flawed and realistic, this book is it for you. It was, essentially, a character study. You get to know them intimately and I enjoyed that aspect the most. These characters are not black and white. Each of them had their reasoning as to why they did what they did, the choices they made and the viewpoints they had. I loved this point was honed in time and time again; that circumstances shape who you are, who you become. That there are many different paths to living your life and that most of the time, things fall under the grey area. There were so many questions that were thrown at the reader and I liked that one had to think for oneself. The answers weren\u2019t handed to you, because does life have all of the answers? You make choices and deal with the consequences, whether good or bad. It created for an interesting discussion and battle within my own head.

Then just as the smoke becomes a raging inferno, the story has gotten under your skin and you've inhaled more than you thought and instead of it going to your lungs, it aims straight for the heart.It's a story of relationships - Mother daughter ones. It starts off with Mia and daughter, Pearl, who move to shaker heights which is an upscale suburban neighbourhood where life is both homogenous and idyllic. Until the adoption of a Chinese baby leaves the community divided. Is it biology that makes a parent? The old argument of nature vs nurture. Or what about decisions that are made in the heat of the moment that become life defining for a child, as regrettable as they may be, should a parent get a 2nd chance? Ng raises some tough moral questions. Ones that had me thinking and arguing in my own head of what is right, wrong and sometimes not negotiable. This one made me just want to hug my daughter a little tighter and have her recognize that my imperfections are to cushion her from the harshness life can sometimes deliver. Ng's writing is captivating. 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f", "Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng is a 2017 Penguin Press publication. A smart, but often scathing look at entitlement coupled with the endless dynamic layers between mother and child. The Clinton era gets a sharp examination as we drop in on Shaker Heights, an ideal suburban community with plenty of unspoken rules for its financially comfortable residents. The Richardson family is the prototype of the community, with Elena Richardson embracing the lifestyle with unparalleled enthusiasm. \u2018Perfection: that was the goal, and perhaps the Shakers had lived it so strongly it had seeped into the soil itself, feeding those who grew up there with a propensity to overachieve and a deep intolerance for flaws.\u2019By contrast, Mrs. Richardson\u2019s new tenants, Mia and her daughter, Pearl, live a free spirited, nomadic life. Mia is a photographer, who works just enough to afford the basics in life. Pearl, though, has no trouble adapting to the stable home life of the Richardson\u2019s, practically becoming a member of the family. Things are working out well enough, until a chain of events unlocks long buried secrets, spawning a bitter custody battle, which exposes cracks in the Richardson\u2019s perfect image, and will culminate in a fiery inferno, both physically and metaphorically. This second novel by Celeste Ng is not quite as grim or heavy as her debut, but it is every bit as provocative. I have had a hard time writing this review because the layers in this story are many, with so many themes to explore. I have worked on it for days, feeling slightly intimidated, unable to find the words that would do justice to such an outstanding novel. |This book adeptly explores hot button issues prevalent twenty years ago, between episodes of Jerry Springer and Clinton\u2019s sex scandals, when a different set of questions were raised, such as interracial adoptions. \u201cIt came, over and over, down to this: What made someone a mother? Was it biology alone, or was it love?\u201dI was impressed with the various contrasts presented in the book, which included the mindset of the privileged juxtaposed against those who find themselves at their mercy. Was there an exacting price for that privilege and was it worth it? I must say, the judgmental hypocrisy is astounding!! But, the heartbeat of the story is centered around motherhood. Every mother represented exposed that instant vulnerability motherhood creates. The pain of infertility and the frustrating process of adoption is examined right along with parental sacrifices and foibles and their consequences. Mia and Mrs. Richardson's children also play an integral part in the story, their roles intertwined and connected in the most ironic of ways. \u2018Izzy had the heart of a radical, but she had the experience of a fourteen-year-old in the suburban Midwest.\u2019One of the more interesting character studies is of Elena- mostly referred to as Mrs. Richardson, which I thought was a very clever way of hammering home a specific point. Her cluelessness, her arrogance, and relentless reproach is extraordinary in light of what is actually taking place.Mia, in turn, may spark a little resentfulness in Mrs. Richardson, and despite my initial puzzlement about her, and I admit I certainly questioned some of her choices, I ended up respecting her a great deal. So, as you can see, the novel is very driven by the characters, each offering a different perspective or new avenue in which to view the situation. Sometimes I felt deep empathy for one character, feeling the acuteness of their pain, but unable to choose a side. It is often heart wrenching and I found myself feeling torn on many occasions. On other occasions, I had a very hard time mustering up any real empathy for a few of these characters. The plotting was very tightly woven and on several occasions, I may have uttered an expletive out loud when misunderstandings exploded in the worst possible way, creating a mountain of tension in the process. This is a very compelling family drama, drawing out a bit of nostalgia, prompting me to take a closer look in the mirror, to put myself in the place of others before passing judgement. But, I also picked up on a bit of sarcasm here and there, almost as if the author was scoffing at some of the attitudes or the mindset of the era, although it was done so in an understated and sly way. It\u2019s been nearly a week since I finished the book and I still find myself mulling over the many layers and angles, and thinking about the characters and the choices they made and how it all came together in the end. So, it is fair to say, this book has had an impact on me, and think it is a novel anyone who appreciates a well written, thought provoking work of fiction will appreciate. Highly recommend!! 5 stars ", "3.7 starsCeleste Ng\u2019s writing style wasn\u2019t super easy to read. I feel the need to stress that Little Fires Everywhere is not a fast-paced, easy to read suburban thriller. It\u2019s a slow-paced novel of fiction that focuses on American suburbia and middle class ethics that often requires more attention when reading to make sure you pick up on every subtle detail. All the time I read this book, I have the sensation that it was a script of an Desperate Housewives. There are not housewife in the book, but the author style, was like that, like a feeling.", "I'd probably give this 3.5, I guess. I don't know. I didn't like this book, but I feel like I should. Ng is a phenomenal writer but I just couldn't get into this book. The first chapter was amazing and I thought I was in for something special.There was a clear theme of ignorance in the \"progressive\" town of Shaker Heights that only outsiders and Izzy could see. The reason I couldn't get into this book was that all the supporting characters felt a little thin. Like they weren't actually people, they were just there to show how ignorant and selfish the people of Shaker Heights were. Mia was obviously a fantastic character and had multiple chapters dedicated to her backstory and why she became the artist she was/why she had the feelings about the central conflict that she had. By the end of the story it felt like there really wasn't a choice. Mia's side was clearly in the right and the Richardsons and the McCulloughs were too ignorant to ever really support. I don't know. I know there are people like them in the world. I know why this book is so popular and it deserves the success it's had.I just couldn't get into it.", "5 complicated stars!\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fI have read SO many wonderful books lately, I keep thinking I can\u2019t rate all these books 5 stars... but then I think how can I not? They all definitely deserve it! SO here I go again with another gushing review!(Currently I\u2019m reading a book I\u2019m not all that crazy about, so I promise a slightly negative review to come\ud83d\ude09)What makes you a mother biology or love?This book was about the bonds between mothers and their children; The relationship between mothers and daughters in particular.... I have a daughter and of course I am a daughter, so I do realize how complicated this relationship can be, even in a somewhat stable environment....The mothers in this book were all very different from one another, but the thing they had in common is that they all truly love their children.... even if they didn\u2019t always do a good job of showing it.... I believe all these women were so well developed as characters, and even if you didn\u2019t agree with their actions you could understand their motivation.... this book really touched on quite a few issues, and I don\u2019t want to mention them in this review, because I don\u2019t want to ruin the journey for you, but it sure did make me think.... Think what would I do in that same situation? It\u2019s hard to say, of course I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d always do the right thing, but then that begs the question what is the right thing? Sometimes I\u2019m not sure if it is as clear cut as that.....The only part of this book that I had an opinion on(OK not the only thing I had an opinion on, but the only thing I\u2019m going to share in this review), because it was very personal for me was the court case.... as I have mentioned previously I am the only biological child in a family of adoptive brother\u2019s (I never got a sister!) And all my brothers are of a different race/ethnicity from me.... I don\u2019t believe I could have loved my brothers anymore had they been biologically related to me, and I don\u2019t believe they ever felt robbed of their culture.... so do I think a white family can raise a Chinese girl? Absolutely! But this is because of personal experience, I grew up in a house with cross-cultural adoption and it was a positive experience.... do I think a biological mother should be given a second chance after abandoning her baby? That I\u2019m not sure about....*** steps off soapbox ***Looking back on this book I think I like it even more.... every character in this book was so well developed, by the end you felt as though you knew these people.... I also think the story was so well plotted how everything unfolded was perfect.... and even though the ending was quite heartbreaking, it just made the book that much better...Definitely strongly recommend! And I hope you enjoy the journey!\ud83d\udc95 PS: I\u2018d love for Mia to take a photo that represented me, wonder what would be on it, a book?"], "genre": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Audiobook", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Book Club", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Family", "Realistic Fiction"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/52959357-little-fires-everywhere", "avg_ratings": "4.11", "ShelvedNumber": "3329"}

Original cover edition here.What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?When his mother became President of the United States, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius\u2014his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with an actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex/Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.Heads of the family and state and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: Stage a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instagrammable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the presidential campaign and upend two nations. It raises the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to ben? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? , how will history remember you?", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566742512l/41150487.jpg", "title": "Red, White & Royal Blue", "authors": "Casey McQuiston", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487-red-white-royal-blue", "reviews": ["Is it possible for your whole body to grin? The answer is hell yes.Red, White & Royal Blue is a story lit up like a beacon to the weary and the lost. My heart still swells with so much delight. The notion of memory simply fails to adequately capture the sensation. I know the words but none of them really encompass the feeling of deep contentment, mixed with the kind of frustration one feels at waking from a sweet dream. I promise you that what memories you will keep of this story will warm you in the cold, and taste sweet when the world runs sour. Do not miss it.\nSo, what\u2019s this book about?\nAh, yes. The one trope that sings to me the most: enemies to \u201cugh I can\u2019t believe I have to be in the same vicinity as you\u201d to \u201cugh we're forced to work together to save our countries' reputations but it\u2019s not like I like you or anything\u201d to \u201cwait, we actually connect pretty well and have a lot of things in common but don't read too much into it\u201d to \u201cI would lay down both of my kidneys for you but that doesn\u2019t mean anything alright\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ll fistfight the moon for you and kill anyone who dares lay a finger on you\u201d to lovers.Alex Claremont-Diaz, the Mexican-American first son of the United States, tolerates Henry, the Prince of England, to about the same degree that Henry tolerates him, but the claws are never entirely sheathed. When one of their verbal sparring matches ends in a \u201ccataclysmically, internationally, terrible way\u201d, Alex and Henry had no choice but to play nice with each other. Of course, building a friendship with your sworn nemesis is never easy. Doing it out of a reluctant sense of obligation is virtually impossible. Only, neither Alex nor Henry were prepared for when it all ceased being pretend. There was no pretending away the momentous thing tentatively taking shape between them. Henry had worn at the shell surrounding Alex\u2019s heart with every traded truth, every phone call made at an ungodly hour, and every stolen moment in hotel rooms. And with every crack, it became harder to deny the connection blazing between them.Yet, all the same, reality threatens to shatter it all.\n\u201cDo you feel forever about him?\u201dAnd there\u2019s no room left to agonize over it, nothing left to do but say the thing he is known all along. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI do.\u201d\nRed, White & Royal Blue is an astonishingly polished debut novel. A beguiling story of romance that pulled a smile from a new place in me where so much delight had been waiting in reserve. The novel\u2019s warm heart leaped out to my cold one, and I held on like I suspected this all of being a dream that\u2019s about to end and leave me falling. I found myself drawing out the last 50 pages or so, absolutely unable, unwilling, to let this joyous little book go. The story wrote itself into my memory and even when I closed my eyes, images of the story kept playing across the darkness again and again.The rumors are true, folks: I am a hopeless romantic.All I want is for someone to feel for me some glimmer of what Henry and Alex feel for each other. To find that one person who has so much aching tenderness for you, who you can talk to and emerge each time a bit less bewildered, a bit more yourself. The one person who will attach the ends of the tightrope from one skyscraper to the next and make you believe that you can make it across, even when you can barely place a foot in front of the other, who will help you lay the skeins of your life out neatly, so there\u2019d be less of a tangle in your heart. Just the sheer joy of simply knowing another human being.There\u2019s such a flood of love spooling out between Henry and Alex, tender and joyful and pure. All wrapped up in the safety and warmth of two people who have passed a point of recognition, of openness, who stood side by side, braced together against the future, knowing that whatever life might force on them, and however it might fail them, they will still have each other. I love how Alex had glided into love unaware, not knowing if it was love or just a suchlike cousin. Then, he plummeted, and it was unmistakable. And all the while, Henry has been there, with a lit cinder of hope in his gaze, and the calm resignation to the inevitable that you\u2019d associate with people aching with the yearning to be loved back.\nWhen Alex was a kid, before anyone knew his name, he dreamed of love like it was a fairy tale, as if it would come sweeping into his life on the back of a dragon one day. When he got older, he learned about love as a strange thing that could fall apart no matter how badly you wanted it, a choice you make anyway. He never imagined it\u2019d turn out he was right both times.\nHenry deserves the world, but the world doesn\u2019t deserve him. Nothing will ever be more hilarious to me than the fact that Henry\u2019s character, when translated by Alex\u2019s gaze in the beginning, is this unbearably supercilious heir, vigorously bearded with an air of having been grudgingly forced into court elegance, whose body is hardened into armor and whose smiles are pickled things. But then that image quickly melts away, revealing this achingly compassionate person whom the stars would be so proud to know their atoms have created someone like him.I love Henry so much. His entire life, he had sailed upon the quiet ripple of his parents\u2019 lives, struggling against the confines of family and legacy and creating a life all his own. But there was so much gold in him, the shine dimmed by years of telling himself there was something wrong with the way he was made. The enormity of this burden was so great it almost wore Henry out, and it smote my heart. But seeing him later embrace the certainty that he\u2019s deserving of compassion and kindness and understanding\u2014it genuinely made me at once gutted and filled with unspeakable tenderness for him. I\u2019m so glad Alex was there to help him see the aspects of his being that were in darkness even to him and give him hope before he had even considered hope to be possible.\n\u201cTake anything you want and know you deserve to have it.\u201d\nSpeaking of Alex. I love him. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole statement.Alex is all fragility with a front of strength. He\u2019s exactly how his heart defines him: strong, gentle and unstoppable. His nature is bonfire, beaming like a beacon, burning like a wildfire out of control. He cares, and hopes, and dreams that, with his earnest work and efforts, grain by grain, the gray would give way to the dream and the sands of the world would shine bright. With Alex, the author has created such a vibrantly human protagonist whose perspective you can understand and whose candor, thoughtful strength, humanity, and resolve you can admire. His journey snagged at my heart and left me feeling like a witness to a very remarkable moment in his life, overwhelmed with gratitude for sharing it.I also love how the author handles with great aplomb a bisexual character who realizes, accepts and embraces his bisexuality in his twenties, just as well as they handle the burgeoning romance between him and Henry. Even side characters here are just as carefully conceived\u2014I love Alex\u2019s crew so much and there\u2019s not much I wouldn\u2019t give for a spinoff series centering each one of them.Red, White & Royal Blue also succeeds with brilliance and verve in addressing issues about racism, gender, responsibility, and ethics. I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoyed the cheeky undercurrent flowing through the novel\u2014the arched eyebrow, the bold and confiding voice. It was all so glorious. As glorious at the fact that this book, at its heart, is a joyful celebration of the people who work so unrelentingly to carve out a place for themselves in a world that gives them freely to everyone else\u2014women who push against what the world decides for them, those who are told that their dreams do not match where they came from and would therefore never be realized, those who love and believe in spite of odium and condemnation. As a queer Muslim immigrant, this meant so much more than words could possibly convey.\nThinking about history makes me wonder how I\u2019ll fit into it one day, I guess. And you too. I kinda wish people still wrote like that. History, huh? Bet we could make some.\nThis is genuinely one of the best\u2014if not the best\u2014romance novels that I\u2019ve ever read. I know I keep saying love is fake, but reading this book melted my cold dead heart. I\u2019m a believer again! And you know what, although I have always been incapable of choosing a \"favorite book,\" I now know that if I had to be stuck on a desert island, with only one book to bring with me, it would definitely be this one. \u2728 wishlist \u2728 blog \u2728 twitter \u2728 tumblr \u2728", "ARC provided by St. Martin's Press in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\u201cIs it possible you willfully forgot about the biggest international event of the year because you don\u2019t want to see your arch nemesis?\u201d\n\nI honestly do not think that any book has made me happier than Red, White & Royal Blue, ever. I laughed, I swooned, I cried, but, most importantly, I finished the last page and felt such a powerful amount of hope that transcends any amount of words that I could possibly string together for this review. This is easily the best debut novel I\u2019ve ever read, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised in the slightest if it ends up being my favorite book of the entire year. First off, in this story, the characters are living in a world where the President of the United States is a democratic woman who was elected after Obama, and her 2020 reelection is quickly approaching. And I just need to take a minute to\u2026 *cries forever*! But this book really focuses on two young men, who happen to be very much in the media\u2019s spotlight 24/7, because of the families they were born into. Oh, and one of them happens to be the First Son of the President, and up until this point he thought he was straight, that is until he finally is forced to spend time with his arch nemesis. And I\u2019ll be damned, but this book made me simultaneously believe in love and believe in America.\u27bd Alexander Gabriel Claremont-Diaz - The First Son, who is quickly realizing that he is bisexual, but slowly coming out to those he feels safe with. Alex is also biracial (Mexican and white) and (thanks to my beautiful friend Alienor) confirmed to have ADHD! \n\n\u201cStraight people, he thinks, probably don\u2019t spend this much time convincing themselves they\u2019re straight.\u201d\n\n\u27bd Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor - A Prince of England, who is closeted gay to many in his family (and to all media), because he constantly feels the weight of the expectations placed on him by his family and his country. \n\n\u201cO, fathers of my bloodline! O, ye kings of olde! Take this crown from me, bury me in my ancestral soil. If only you had known the mighty work of thine loins would be undone by a gay heir who likes it when American boys with chin dimples are mean to him.\u201d\n\nAlex has followed Henry and his fame long before his mother became president. But at the start of this novel, both men officially meet, but quickly get into a very messy predicament at a royal wedding they were both attending, which ends up being a PR nightmare for both countries, but especially for Alex\u2019s mom, who is up for reelection. So, they are both kind of forced to fake a friendship to appease the press to save face. But a fake friendship quickly turns to a romance, that leaves both men questioning what they are willing to risk, while the press is always watching. \n\n\u201cFirst, you\u2019ve been, like, Draco Malfoy\u2013level obsessed with Henry for years\u2014do not interrupt me\u2014and since the royal wedding, you\u2019ve gotten his phone number and used it not to set up any appearances but instead to long-distance flirt with him all day every day.\u201d\n\nI also wanted to make sure that I stated in my review that the author is queer (I believe they ID as bisexual, like Alex!) And even though Alex and Henry are obviously queer in their m/m relationship, this book also has such a beautiful and full cast of diverse side characters! I\u2019m completely willing to give my life for June, Nora, Pez, and Bea, right this very second. Like, I absolutely loved the side characters in this book. Also, you all know that I am always here for strong sibling relationships, and this book has that in spades! Alex\u2019s family in general was everything to me; both of his parents being so supportive and always putting him (and his pace) first really meant a lot to me and makes me so soft just thinking about it. Seriously, this book is found family and blood family goals. The banter and one-liners were perfection. This author completely understands what it is like to speak and text in your twenties, and they have mastered the craft to perfection. I was either cackling like a banshee or clutching my pearls with heart eyes during all of Alex and Henry\u2019s exchanges. Also, since there is an ocean in-between these two, they correspond a lot of the time through emails, all of which added five years to my life. Speaking of those emails, the romance in this is just truly a tier above the rest! The dynamic that Henry and Alex are forced into, and then the new dynamics they are forced to overcome, makes for something that you can\u2019t help but root for with everything in your soul. Also, they are truly polar opposites with their personalities, but seeing them together truly feels like you are witnessing soulmates interact. I hate to say this but, your OTP could never. And obviously because of the setup of this novel, this book does not shy away from US politics, and you should for sure know that going in. But the most tears I shed in this book was when Alex talked about what he felt like to be a biracial kid, and how America truly is a melting pot of immigrants and how that is something beautiful, and should be celebrated, not shamed and something that people consider to be a crime. This is a book about two men, both in their early- twenties, discovering what they want for their lives and for their countries. Both for themselves and together. In a world that is cruelly unaccepting to anyone who isn\u2019t white and straight, or who are just deemed different. They find friendship, they find love, and they find their voices. And to this Filipino American, pansexual, whose grandparents are both immigrants, who a lot of times really struggles to find their own voice, it meant the world to me. I\u2019ll carry this book with me forever and always.Overall, this book was just everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. Put your library holds and preorders in now, because I know that so many readers are not only going to fall in love with this tale, but it is going to be one of their favorites for the rest of their lives. I promise you, it is truly that good, and this truly feels like a once in a lifetime book. Casey McQuiston has created something that is going to mean so much to so many readers, and this book is going to bring so much joy to our much-needed world. I\u2019m just forever thankful that I was able to escape into it for a little while, while doing everything I can to make my country's 2020 and on just as hopeful.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Youtube | Twitch The quotes above were taken from an ARC and are subject to change upon publication.Content and Trigger Warnings for homophobia (always in a negative light), talk of racism in media, anxiety depiction, talk of cancer (pancreatic) in the past, talk of past loss of a loved one, talk of past drug use, talk of attempted sexual assault (very briefly) in the past from a very minor side character, and (in my opinion) outing.

I wanted to write a review for it when I finished it last week, but I only get internet when we're docked and the internet on this ship is .99 a minute.

But I felt bad not writing a review because I think this book is important and it needs to be read, and it's also cute and hot and funny, kinda like our cruise director, but that's for another day.

Surely that many review copies weren't available? BUT, it certainly worked....I've never been so interested in reading something.I mean I've lost count of this appearing on my feed with so many glowing reviews .And that's ok,each to their own.We all have different tastes but when a book gets such positively you'd be forgiven for expecting something pretty damn special,wouldn't you?For me,this book isn't anything special at all.It's mediocre.-the characters are flat,uninspired,and quite frankly boring.Alex at least had something about him but Henry was like a cardboard cut out.-the writing was all over the place and juvenile at times.The story jumped from scene to scene with no flow to the story.I lost count of how many times I had to go back and read certain scenes.-the British stereotyping just annoyed me.It was like the Author googled 'all things British' and decided to include them regardless of whether they worked.Granted,if you aren't British this probably wouldn't be an issue.But I am.And it was.-the sex scenes,Firstly let me say I don't always need graphic sex scenes,in fact some of the best romance books I've read haven't had many at all.But what on earth happened here.They would start off with lots of kissing,hands in hair,a bit of desperation and then nothing.Literally.It was over and you were kind of told they'd had sex.Most of the time I had no idea what they'd actually been up to.And,as a result,I felt zero connection or chemistry between them.I didn't get them as lovers at all.They just came across as best friends for me.-I know it's fiction but it's got to be believable.And this wasn't.I mean these two would float about in restaurants,stay in hotels where no one recognized them! This would absolutely not happen with a member of the royal family or with the FSOTUS I'm guessing Where were the bodyguards or paparazzi?-enemies to lovers? No it wasn't.They disliked each other for ridiculous reasons quite frankly.-a lot of people have mentioned the politics....thankfully I gave up before that got too bad.", "Make some noise for the winner of best romance and debut novel categories! Alex and Henry, you\u2019re so adorable and I enjoyed every word about this amazing couple\u2019s poignant, unique, memorable love story!!!Yayyyyyy!!!!\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfffCLAP! CLAP! CLAP! My three S letter words summarize my feelings about this book: SPECTACULAR, SPLENDID, SPECIAL!No need to attend an auction! I\u2019m shaken, I\u2019m smiling, my feelings are everywhere and my mind already flew to the moon! It\u2019s another five gazillion stars and I think so far, one of my best romance readings of 2019!I cried my eyes out and exceeded my sighing record with 428 sighs! At least 200 times I hit my forehead for waiting too long to read this powerful, emotional, lovely story. I loved challenging, poignant, sincere story-telling and of course the characterization is so good than I expected. I don\u2019t know which hero I loved the most. But I think Alex stole my heart from the first pages.Let\u2019s meet with our lovely heroes: Alex Claremont Diaz, Filipino-American first son of the US (Amen to that!) and Henry the Prince of the United Kingdom. At first they barely tolerate each other, exchanging a few ugly words and then they realize they\u2019re acting immature because they created a real PR fiasco at the royal wedding. So they need to form a fake friendship ASAP for the sake of political balances between the countries. And of course as you can imagine, their pretending relationship turned into something special, something even melting the heart of the cruelest bitch (a.k.a : me! Even you\u2019re not human, coming from an outer planet, you still feel deeply for this beautiful couple and shed some tears!!!) What I like about this book: This is not only an amazing, heartbreaking and tear jerker romance between Alex and Henry, there are amazing supporting characters you could easily relate with them. It is impossible to want to cuddle Nora and not admire her so much. And we shouldn\u2019t forget Bea, Pez and June. This book is about siblings, family dynamics, bounding devoted friendship, diversity, freedom of thought, diaspora politics, searching for your true identity and path in your life. It\u2019s effective, poignant, heartbreaking, compelling, genuine and honest! It\u2019s about two boys in twenties, discovering their expectations from the life, love and doing something best for the benefits of their own countries which is a quiet burden for their unique, flawless, real relationship because we live in a word full of stereotyped, judgmental thoughts affect to express our real opinions, honest thoughts. Especially Alex\u2019s great struggle for expressing himself, finding his place in the world as a pansexual young man, coming from immigrated Filipino family is the most meaningful, effective and crucial part of the book which hurt my heart deeply. Well done Casey McQuiston! The author honestly knows how to create a soul brushing, heart stealing harmony! It was fantastic debut journey! Cannot wait to read more from the author\u2019s work!", "\u201dHe wants to set himself on fire, but he can\u2019t afford for anyone to see him burn.\u201dFirst of all: If you want to read my full and uncensored review with all the quotes and my personal trademark rambling you can do it here! And now to the considerably shortened goodreads review! (word limits *shakes head*)This sentence, this book, the topics that are tackled, the honest and blunt way they are dealt with and approached?! This was everything!!! I love this book so much, I can\u2019t even put it into words. <333 Well, I loved it and some little, tiny, infinitesimal part of me might haven even hated it for being so perfect! Because the way subjects are approached in here? Gods, I wish everyone would be as open minded as the characters in this book. That sentence at the beginning of my review? It hit close to home, it pains me to read it, yet I still love the fact that Casey McQuiston wrote it down on paper! That she had the guts to give this particular kind of feeling her own voice and words. How many people who are forced to be in the closet have felt like that? How many children were afraid to come out to their parents? How many still didn\u2019t do it and never will, because they know exactly what their parents might say? How they will react\u2026 How many of us have felt alone and were weighted down by the truth? This book, this supposedly romantic comedy, it touched me in a way books rarely do. It ripped out my heart, it made me laugh, it stomped all over my feelings, it smacked me across the face, it forced me to confront me with myself and it gave me something I didn\u2019t even know I was missing: It gave me hope. Hope that there is a better world out there. Hope that one day people will accept others the way they are. Hope that people can change. Hope that we\u2019re all equal and that our actions count more than our outward appearance. Hope that our future in this world is worth fighting for. So if you decide to read this book, enjoy it! Laugh and cry, appreciate the politics and scheming, adore Henry and Alex for being the way they are, fall in love, enjoy their freedom and youth, but most of all find yourself in those pages and try to keep this feeling even after you closed the book. ;-)The characters:\nDo I even have to mention that you\u2019ll be spoiled into oblivion if you dare to cross this line?! *lol* This is my characters section and I wouldn\u2019t be me if I wouldn\u2019t gush like a crazy little teen! XD So you\u2019ve been warned! Dare to move on or leave it at that. Your decision, your choice. ;-P\nAlex:\u201dAlex\u2019s image is all charisma and genius and smirking wit, thoughtful interviews and the cover of GQ at eighteen; Henry\u2019s is placid smiles and gentle chivalry and generic charity appearances, a perfectly blank Prince Charming canvas. Henry\u2019s role, Alex thinks, is much easier to play.\u201dI didn\u2019t like Alex at the beginning of the book! I know this might come as a shock but I really felt like he was sitting on his high horse and didn\u2019t even bother to think about how other people felt. Or in this particular case how Henry felt. In his mind he gave him a role and never even looked beyond the horizon. But then the accident with the cake happened and Alex was forced to spend some time with Henry and he finally realized what a dumbass he actually was. I loved how Alex realized that he likes him and I adored him for being so unapologetic about his bisexuality. He just accepted it as a part of himself, he wondered about it, he explored it but he never felt bad about being who he truly was! And this was amazing! I wish there would be more bi representations like that; I wish that everyone would be as cool about being bi as Alex was. As his friends and family were! It was a huge part of him but it didn\u2019t define him or is actions. This was so wholesome and such a nice way to deal with your own sexuality. Then again Alex is a very confident and brazen character so to deal with it like that fit him perfectly. XD\u201dIt\u2019s unpredictable and it\u2019s intoxicating and it\u2019s fun, because Alex has never met a challenge he didn\u2019t love, and he \u2013 well, Henry is a challenge, head to toe, beginning to end.\u201d\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t feel wronged deep in his gut. But that everyone seems enamored, when the only difference between the lie and the truth that would burn up Fox News is the gender involved \u2026 well, it fucking stings.\u201d\u201dSer\u00eda una mentira, porque no ser\u00eda \u00e9l.\u201d It would be a lie, because it wouldn\u2019t be him.Henry:\u201dHmm,\u201d Henry says, making a show of thinking hard. \u201cI always liked Luke. He\u2019s brave and good, and he\u2019s the strongest Jedi of them all. I think Luke is proof that it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or who your family is \u2013 you can always be great if you\u2019re true to yourself.\u201d I FREAKING LOVED, LOVED, LOVED and LOVED, Henry! *lol* This boy is adorable and kind and sweet and gentle and everything anyone will ever need! <333 I mean he\u2019s a Warsie and Potterhead!!! He ships Lupin with Sirius and he loves to watch Bake Off because it\u2019s so soothing??!! Where the freaking hell is my Prince Henry!!??? *lol* I definitely need this fluffy biscuit Prince in my life! Like yesterday! XD But there\u2019s also a wild side to Henry, a defiant one and boy did I ever live for those little snippets of his personality! I adored his character arc so much! I mean at the beginning of the book he was the shy and reserved prince and by the end of it he eventually found his own voice and shouted his innermost thoughts into the world. Still, it was so sad that his father died when he was so young and I felt Henry\u2019s grief like it was my own. T_T I could understand why his mother decided to withdraw from the world, but I was really glad that she accepted her son the way he was and fought for him in the end. =)\u201dA curious thing about grief is the way it takes your entire life, all those foundational years that made you who you are, and makes them so painful to look back upon because of the absence there, that suddenly they\u2019re inaccessible. You must invent an entirely new system.\u201d\u201dWhat are we even defending here, Philip? What kind of legacy? What kind of family, that says, we\u2019ll take the murder, we\u2019ll take the raping and pillaging and the colonizing, we\u2019ll scrub it up nice and neat in a museum, but oh no, you\u2019re a bloody poof? That\u2019s beyond our sense of decorum! I\u2019ve bloody well had it. I\u2019ve sat about long enough letting you and Gran and the weight of the damned world keep me pinned, and I\u2019m finished. I don\u2019t care. You can take your legacy and your decorum and you can shove it up your fucking arse, Philip. I\u2019m done.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ve been gay as a maypole since the day I came out of Mum, Philip.\u201d Nora:\u201dNumbers on me being into dudes?\u201dThat pulls Nora up short, before she cocks her head to the side and says. \u201cSeventy-eight percent probability of latent bisexual tendencies. One hundred percent probability this is not a hypothetical question.\u201dI loved Nora\u2019s analytical mind and her conversations with Alex. It was obvious they were great friends and knew each other better than anyone else. XD And don\u2019t kill me for this but: WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON WITH NORA AND JUNE???!!! There was something there, right? I didn\u2019t imagine this unresolved sexual tension, did I? *lol* Want to hear my thoughts on it? I think there was some sort of threesome going on the night they celebrated at the karaoke bar. Pez, Nora AND June! All three of them, feel me? *wriggles eyebrows* Unfortunately this is a mystery that was neither tackled nor resolved so my imagination will have to continue to run wild and I\u2019ll blame it all on Casey McQuiston! *lol* ;-PAlex\u2019s parents:\u201dHow many times do I have to tell y\u2019all not to discuss your murder plots in front of a sitting president?\u201d their mother interrupts. \u201cPlausible deniability. Come on.\u201d Haha! This sentence instantly made me love the President! XD She was such a cool woman and Alex was so lucky to have her as his mum! It was amazing how she could be all business but at the same time always watched out for her kids. They were her first priority no matter how important her job was and she would have done anything to make them happy. Yes, she had a lot of responsibility and tried to perform damage control, but that was mostly due to her feelings for her son. She didn\u2019t want Alex to get hurt and she wanted to protect him. I mean she was a public figure and we all know how those games are played. Well and as it turned out, Richards played very dirty indeed. >_< Also can we appreciate how Alex\u2019s dad reacted to him being bi and loving Henry? I wish more parents would say words like that to their queer kids! Because it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not different when it\u2019s your own kid, you still love your child and want the best for it. (At least it should be that way!!!) You want it to be happy, right? See, that\u2019s exactly what I meant when I said this book gave me hope. =)His dad slaps him on the bicep with the spoon, leaving a splatter of crema and cheese behind. \u201cHave a little more faith in your old man than that, eh? A little appreciation for the patron saint of gender-neutral bathrooms in California? Little shit.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, sorry!\u201d Alex says, laughing. \u201cI just know it\u2019s different when it\u2019s your own kid.\u201dHis dad laughs too, rubbing a hand over his goatee. \u201cIt\u2019s really not. Not to me, anyway. I see you.\u201d\u201dDiaz, you insane, hopeless romantic little shit,\u201d says the voice of the President of the United States, muffled in the bed. \u201cIt had better be forever. Be safe.\u201d\u201dI am your mother. I was your mother before I was ever the president, and I\u2019ll be your mother long after, to the day they put me in the ground and beyond this earth. You are my child. So, if you\u2019re serious about this, I\u2019ll back your play.\u201d The relationships & ships:Henry & Alex: \u201dLet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather be waterboarded,\u201d Henry says, smiling back. The camera snaps nearby. His eyes are big and soft and blue, and he desperately needs to be punched in one of them. \u201cYour country could probably arrange that.\u201dAlex throws his head back and laughs handsomely, loud and false. \u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d\u201cHardly enough time,\u201d Henry says.\u201dI could have quoted the entire book, I swear!!! There were so many amazing quotes, countless sweet and tender moments, about a thousand ways they told each other that they are in love. <3 Easy banter, sassy retorts, just everything you could possibly wish for. One of my personal highlights was the Turkey Gate though. *lol* And their e-mails, hell, their e-mails killed me! T_T I loved how they swore so much in their normal conversations but wrote so beautiful messages to each other. And considering that to write a message takes time and that you think long and hard what to write this was very realistic too. They were utterly, truly and madly in love and you could read it in every line! I felt so sorry for them though. It must have been so tough to be exposed like that and to deal with the press and consequences. Alone the fact that Richards leaked their relationship and didn\u2019t even give a damn about their feelings. They were outed by others and it was NOT their own decision! And this is wrong!!! If you decide to out yourself it\u2019s a personal thing, it\u2019s something you decide, something that should be in your hands! You should be able to decide when you come out to your family, your friends or the world. If you never want to come out that\u2019s okay too, but it is YOUR DECISION to make and no one should take this away from you! GRRR!! *grizzly bear mode* I guess you can already tell that this is a very important and touchy subject for me. XD But I feel about this strongly, because not everyone is ready to come out and for many people to take this step means to give up the life they are used to. Not everyone is as understanding as Alex\u2019s family and not everyone accepts a person the way it is\u2026 Anyway, those two are sharing the first place with Baz and Simon now. *LOL* Because I love both of those m/m couples so much and can\u2019t decide which one is the better OTP! XD Their level of cuteness is just off the charts!! <333Henry\u2019s whole face grimaces in frustration, his eyes casting skyward like they\u2019re searching for help from an uncaring universe. \u201cChrist, you are as thick as it gets,\u201d he says, and he grabs Alex\u2019s face in both hands and kisses him.\u201dShould I tell you that when we\u2019re apart, your body comes back to me in dreams? That when I sleep, I see you, the dip of your waist, the freckle above your hip, and when I wake up in the morning, it feels like I\u2019ve just been with you, the phantom touch of your hand on the back of my neck flesh and not imagined? That I can feel your skin against mine, and it makes every bone in my body ache? That, for a few moments, I can hold my breath and be back there with you, in a dream, in a thousand rooms, nowhere at all?\u201d \u201dbut I\u2019ve kissed your mouth, that corner, that place it goes, so many times now. i\u2019ve memorized it. Topography on the map of you, a world i\u2019m still charting. i know it. i added it to the key. here: inches to miles. i can multiply it out, read your latitude and longitude. recite your coordinates like la rosaria.\u201d Conclusion:\u201cRed, White & Royal Blue\u201d was one of my most anticipated reads this year and I wasn\u2019t disappointed! This book was everything I wanted it to be and it made me so, so happy! McQuiston tackled a lot of serious topics and they varied from loss and depression up to homophobia and political schemes. This book was an amazing composition about love, hate, ignorance and prejudices. Some might say it\u2019s a modern fairy tale and I\u2019m inclined to agree. What made this book truly outstanding is its final message though: You are perfect just the way you are! You are beautiful and you are allowed to love yourself! Or to say it with Alex\u2019s words:\u201dTake everything you want and know you deserve to have it.\u201d___________________________________Four damn good reasons to read this book:1.)\tIt\u2019s still pride month and it\u2019s about time I finally read a LGBTQ+ book! 2.)\tI\u2019ve been dying to read this for months!3.)\tAfter all those dystopian science fiction books I really need a fluffy break! >_<4.)\tI just can\u2019t seem to be able to say no to this girl! XD I'm sure she's very happy now. *lol*", "me, awkwardly watching all the raving reviews for this book and being scared to give my pretty negative, highly unpopular yet ultimately very honest opinion:Ok, so please don't hate me, I'm fragile.But also, in all seriousness, I didn't like this book. I know, I know, how dare I? Well, let me explain to you in detail just how I dare. Beware of the long review!A few months ago, everyone was getting ARCs for this book and absolutely everyone was loving it and giving it five stars. Obviously, I was pretty hyped up for this one, as you can imagine. I knew I had to read it, and I knew, just\u00a0knew, that I was going to love the crap out of it! It was looking to be one of my favorites of 2019!Except, that's not really how it all went down.I mean, don't get me wrong! It didn't absolutely suck, nor was it the worst book I've ever read. It was nice. It had its cute moments. I actually laughed at some parts. I just wanted more. I wanted a cuteness overload. I wanted to fall head over heels into this story, I wanted to love these charcters, I wanted this to be a five-star read!It wasn't. Obviously.I've been reading a bucket load of contemporary romances lately and it's all in the hope that I'll find something to make this cold little heart of mine melt! I want something akin to The Hating Game, a book that killed me, revived me, and killed me again, twice over because that's how many times I read it in the span of 24 hours.But, alas, my search for such a book has proven futile as no other contemporary romance will do. And I'm so, very sorry to say, but Red, White & Royal Blue\u00a0didn't even come close.Now to the review!Maybe this book is heavily overhyped or maybe I'm just a miserable, heartless girl. Both are possible, but either way, I had a lot of problems with this book and I'm not gonna pretend otherwise.No, there is no one thing that makes me think the book sucks. There is no one major flaw that I can point out and blame for my rating. If anything, my issues are a series of small things that will surely be overlooked, or even praised by the masses when the book is released.For starters, this book felt to me like it was trying way too hard at times.If this book were PG it would undoubtedly be turned into a Disney Channel movie, down to the unrealistically happy ending where we all pretend the world is made of rainbows, cotton candy, and unicorn farts.And, honestly, I wouldn't necessarily mind that. I love happy endings. If the book had been only about romance, it would have been fine. But, the book insisted on shoving politics down my throat and the overidealized ending seemed forced, disingenuous, and so utterly predictable! It also felt like the author was trying to force a political view on us.The world the book shows is what ours would look like through rose-colored glasses. It's a world where the female president of the United States is a white, Texan democrat. Where leaked personal emails have no impact on presidential elections. Where a royal prince believes empires are the literal devil, despite benefiting from the monarchy in every single way possible. Where First Son of the U.S. and the British Prince would go everywhere without anyone taking a picture and being surrounded by a million bodyguards. Also, their affair wouldn't have any global consequences that would impact international relationships not just between the U.S. and the U.K, but with every other country as well.It's also a world where people who don't buy into this PC world are demonized for their beliefs. Where if you aren't on board with the particular brand of politics that the author is selling, then you might as well be the devil incarnate. In the end, there are no consequences to anything. It made all the obstacles between the romance seem weak and insubstantial. The author put so much focus on the laughable politics that I couldn't help but roll my eyes.  She tried to tackle racism, international relationships, homophobia, complicated family drama, equality, imperialism, and just about every other social issue currently being talked about, all while also trying to deliver a good romance.And it didn't work!The politics in this book seemed so forced! And so unnecessary. They made the book drag on for ages. Seriously though, there was no need for this book to end up being 432 pages long! That's just uncalled for.So yes, maybe I am heartless. I'm willing to accept that now.Those things I mentioned are ones that a lot of people are undoubtedly gonna find cute. People are gonna argue that\u00a0'the book doesn't have to be realistic!' and I agree. It's just so insanely unbelievable and so politically forced that I could help but be incredibly annoyed by it. Sorry. But also, I'm not sorry.This was supposed to be a cute, romance about two adorable gay boys falling in love! Not a book about idealized political views. If it had been only a romance novel, I would have liked it more, although honestly, not by much.I liked some of the dialogue. I laughed sometimes. It was cute. But sometimes the characters felt off to me. Like they were trying so hard to be relatable and likable that they broke their established characteristics. Also, the very premise of the book is enemies to lovers and it\u2019s not really even that In the end, this book just wasn't for me, I think. Many of you will love it. I'm sure of it. I just couldn't love it how I wanted. There were too many subplots, too many social issues trying to become part of the main story. I think a book that did this better was The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue. And not to be that person that compares all the gay books, but I think that one was better at weaving everything in there in ways relevant to the plot and showing realistic consequences of the character's choices.I went into this book expecting one thing. I got something else instead, and in the end, I think that's the real problem. If I'm honest, all the issue I mentioned are things that in a book I enjoyed, I might have overlooked. Sadly, this wasn't that book. Hopefully, you all have better luck with it and please be respectful of my opinion. My issue with the book has nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ aspect, it has to do with the overall execution.Also, just a warning, this book is NOT, Young Adult. It contains explicit sexual content!**I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.**Follow Me Here Too: My Blog || Twitter || Bloglovin' || Instagram || Tumblr || Pinterest", "\n\u201cBut the truth is, also, simply this: love is indomitable.\"\nMy heart is so entirely full, it's nearly overflowing. This book was in a word; matchless. I laughed, I loved, I cried but mostly loved every beautiful little thing that led up to the last page. Now, having finished, I wish for nothing more but to go all the way back to the beginning and start again. As readers, sometimes -very rarely- you come across a book that quintessentially becomes a mantra, a new sense of hope and a burst of something you never really knew existed. I don't think I will ever forget this novel. _______________\nOn the off chance this book hasn't already won you over... \nFor a glimpse on my current situation: i'm sporting sweatpants, haven't cooked for more than 24 hours, hair's an absolute mess, feel like screaming how gay i am out the window, and completely abandoned my responsibilities. my horoscope did not prepare me for this. When this book is published, and readers pick it up for the first time, I'm going to be sitting and watching all the emotions unfurl and all the fan;art,fiction,girling commence. And while I sit and watch, I'm going to be so jealous of everyone that has the luxury of reading this for the first time. It's equal parts funny and loving and clever and tragic. I made a note on my kindle at page 3 stating \"this is it,\" because that's how much I could feel the energy of a fucking brilliant book in my hands. The camaraderie and friendship combined with rebellion and sexy banter is almost too good to be in one novel. This is quite possibly the easiest five stars I have \never\n given. \n\n\"So, you can hate the heir to the throne all you want, write mean poems about him in your diary, but the minute you see a camera, you act like the sun shines out of his dick, and you make it convincing.\u201d \u201cHave you met Henry?\u201d Alex says. \u201cHow am I supposed to do that?

He thinks about Henry, and something twists in his chest, like a stretch he\u2019s been avoiding for too long.\"\n\nThis was an enemies to lovers romance with so much more going for it.

Bea was the softest cinnamon role in the whole bakery and when they were all together, my heart started singing. \n\n\u201cAlexander, babes,\u201d Pez says when he picks up. \u201cHow lovely for you to give your auntie Pezza a ring on this magnificent Sunday morning.\u201d He\u2019s smiling from what looks like the passenger seat of a luxury car, wearing a cartoonishly large sunhat and a striped pashmina.\"\n\nI wish I could go up to every one that will ever have doubts about reading this book and beg them to give it a chance.

Yet, here I am, falling incredibly in love with everything this book is and will continue to be in my life.\n\n\u201cNever tell me the odds.\"\n\n", "\nHistory, huh?\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting to love Red, White & Royal Blue. I mean, this is Casey McQuiston's first book, and it's written in present tense (ugh), but love it I did. I loved it HARD. Red, White & Royal Blue was everything I was looking for and more.My reading experience was simply me laughing, crying, or swooning in a continuous cycle. Sometimes all three at once. It's been a long, long time since I've wanted to melt into a puddle of goo on the floor because the romance!!! Holy god, this story was the romancey-romance of your dreams.I'm a sucker for a few things in a romance book, and this story has nearly all of them. We get a sexual awakening (can I get a halleloo?!), an enemies-to-lovers (with all the glorious damn, your face, bruising kissing that I could dream up), witty banter for daaaaaaaaaaays, and a romance with a literal (okay, fictional... but still) PRINCE OF MOTHER FORKING ENGLAND. Did Casey McQuiston worm her way into my brain and pull out my deepest fantasies?!?!?!I wanted to take a nap inside these pages. I took pictures and screenshots of my Kindle of the uber-romantic email exchange to swoon over later. I cried and laughed like a lunatic on my couch, huddled in a prison of tea and reading of my own making. I fell asleep with the imprint of my Kindle on my face at 3 am. Even though I don't like reading about politics or political games, even though present tense makes me feel itchy (did I mention that yet??), and even though the sex scenes are suggestive but still fade-to black I wanted to read this book FOREVER.The dialogue is something I will remember for a long time. The humor was absolutely everything and elevated this book from good to unbelievably amazing. The feelings were so intense I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. Red, White & Royal Blue is worth all the hype and more. It's worth your time and your money, and it's worth it to read something so fun and heartfelt and rare that it made it's way on to my elusive favorites list. With literally thousands of romances under my belt, this one still stands out. And nothing will matter but just we two, we two longing loves at last come together.*Copy provided in exchange for an honest review*goodreads|instagram|twitter|blog", "I really just binge reread this book in an hour and a half.

She\u2019s certain he was the one who vandalized the sign outside one particular senator\u2019s office to read BITCH MCCONNELL, but she\u2019ll never prove it.\n\nA ridiculous romance between the made-up prince of England and the made-up son of the made-up first woman president has no right to be this good. And yet.For those of you wondering if I\u2019m joking about the premise of this book, I am completely not. It\u2019s escapism to a world where American politics are at their normal level of messed up, but. You know. The election went in a different direction. (The popular vote direction, just like, by the way.) It\u2019s a book about the importance of loving in a world very very desperate to tear down love. The use of historical love letters\u2026 OOF. Radclyffe Hall to Evguenia Souline, Alexander Hamilton to John Laurens, Eleanor Roosevelt to Lorena Hickock, Michelangelo to Tommaso Cavalieri, Wilfred Owen to Siegfried Sassoon, Jean Cocteaua to Jean Marais. I will say it: the Vita-Sackville-West-to-Virginia-Woolf letter is absolutely one of my favorite pieces of writing of all time and makes me cry daily. And the line \u201chistory, huh?\u201d got me. And it\u2019s a book about love as a choice. The line \u201cOn purpose. I love him on purpose.\u201d has reached an almost memetic level on Tumblr and Twitter, but I get it. There are so many narratives, especially in queer lit, about love as something choiceless. But the thing is love is always a choice. And when you find the right person, it\u2019s a good one. It helps that the cast of characters is just really excellent. Alex and Henry are both really well-written characters, but Alex\u2019s narration is genuinely incredibly hilarious. I laugh easily, but I\u2019ve found that writing good humor can be kind of hard, and this worked for me. Nora and June are each good side characters. I also really appreciated characters like Bea, Pez, and Zahra, who show up briefly but make an impact anyway. But. that is why this is objectively ridiculous romance novel resonated with me harder than 90% of the books I\u2019ve read this year, as a lesbian who is almost definitely going to major in history or polisci (or both, I have another year).

I\u2019m actually having a doughnut while writing this so that should do.\nRed, White & Royal Blue\n is not exactly my type of reading. I mean, I had doubts I\u2019d possibly like this kind of fiction, and the synopsis didn\u2019t quite help me in that area. But you guys (yeah, you, the ones who read it and fell in obsession with it) made me want to give it a try with your exuberance.AND I BLOODY LOVED IT.Really, after the first chapter I was like girl, keep reading, why the hell you stopped?It made me feel excruciatingly giggly.What made it super pleasant for me is the twist of the political reality \u2013 the United States actually has a female president, which is a determined lady from Texas and she has two amazing children who happen to be half Mexican. How cool is that though?On the other hand, I found a bit of time and event inaccuracy in this that actually disturbs my OCD and keeps me awake at night.At first, I thought the action was happening by the end of 2019 and then some mumbo-jumbo happens and we\u2019re in the middle of 2020 somehow and no one but absolutely no one gives a shit about the fact that the 2020 Olympics are happening then.Anyway, those are details that would probably be discussed by me with a shrink in a private session of why am I like this. Let me show you instead another positive thing about this book that I really loved.These characters, man. These characters are EVERYTHING, I swear.They all are so sweet and so witty and so lovely and they make you feel so warm and welcome. They\u2019re just a bunch of nutters. It\u2019s like you have everything you need in a handful of persons:- Strong mums who love their children and help them and support them no matter what;- Equally amazing father figures with whom I\u2019d actually enjoy having a beer;- Fabulously beautiful and intelligent and daring girls who are the world\u2019s best sisters and can easily be your best friends (and I mean all of them, June, Bea, Nora);- Two terribly sweet boys who are so pure and so dirty and so completely mad at the same time I\u2019ll personally unleash hell for them if that\u2019s what\u2019ll make them feel safe;(Also, teeny-tiny thingy here: I TOTALLY COULD FEEL HENRY IS A PIECES AND ALEX IS AN ARIES. I could feel it in my bones, I swear. Henry is as slightly introverted and as prone to extreme mood swings and as puppy-lovable like every Pieces I know and Alex is as stubborn and as passionate and ready to take over the world, making plans, being the centre of every event, burying himself in thousands of projects as every single Aries I know. Jesus, this is disturbingly accurate.)- The ultimate eccentric best friend who is like that one person you\u2019d love to spend time with and know he\u2019s going to force you to have a good time and you\u2019ll love it aka Pez;- A gay Latino Skittles-eating guardian angel aka Rafael Luna (even his name is full of essence);- Zahra \u2013 the biggest fucking mood in the entire Universe;All of the characters are part of this amazing feeling you get while reading the book, it\u2019s something cosy and familiar and warm.The love in this book is real and is tear-dropping. But still, let me warn you about some aspects.There are loads of hook-ups and sexy-scenes in there, some more detailed, some not-so, but you still get the picture. Dead-ass serious now, to me, they are a bit cringe. But not because of a boy loving another boy. God no. To me, scenes like that, with an explicit type of content, are cringe as hell in general. No matter in which -sexuality suffix they end.So. This was a lit book. I loved it. Even more than I thought. And while reading it, I didn\u2019t care who fell in love with whom and everything. I actually forgot about all these stereotypes and labels the society tries to push down our throats. For moments on, there was just me, witnessing a love story unfolding. And this was fucking amazing because, being from a socially and mentally constipated country, I don\u2019t get to see acts of freedom like that. Which scream at me with love.\n\u201cI thought, this is the most incredible thing I have ever seen, and I had better keep it a safe distance away from me. I thought, if someone like you ever loved me, it would set me on fire. And then I was a careless fool, and I fell in love with you anyway (\u2026). And then, inexplicably, you had the absolute audacity to love me back. Can you believe it?\u201d\n(x)", "\nReread update 11/11/19:IM A MESS, PART 2Original review 6/29/19:IM A MESS\n", "THIS IS THE CUTEST FLUFFIEST BOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.This made me...blush? And I famously cannot blush. One time my high school English teacher overheard me saying I didn\u2019t do the assigned reading and he called me out in front of the whole class, and I, like a tiny badass (pretending my heart wasn\u2019t pounding and I wasn\u2019t more nervous than I\u2019ve ever been), was like \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not trying to hide anything. I didn\u2019t do the reading.\u201d And he, taken aback, went, \u201c...You\u2019re not even blushing.\u201dSo, to recap: me, a school-obsessed profoundly shy 15-year-old being called out in front of all her very cool peers by her scary old man teacher = no blushing.The sheer adorableness of this book = Blush City, population me.CASEY MCQUISTON IS A STAR.This book has:- amazing banter- the best side characters - fantastic friendships - so much humor (I laughed! At a book! When does that HAPPEN!) - tons of angst (actually too much angst sometimes - I got a little tired of this book towards the end) - a great meet cute (except not actually a meeting. A re-meet-cute? Can I coin a term?)- the best idea for a forbidden / enemies-to-lovers romance EVER!!! No exaggeration.So, in short, Casey McQuiston is, after just one book, a complete auto-buy author for me.However.This was not a perfect book. And in truth it made me cringe many times.Like, yes, on the one hand everyone is right and this is the cutest, fluffiest, most fun read of all time.On the other hand...I do not want my politics to be cute-fluffy-fun. I do not want them to be revisionist history where the current administration is absurdly well motivated and diverse and perfect and there is no corruption or back-hallway negotiation at all. It\u2019s not realistic and to be honest, it makes me cringe.If I wanted an idealized-to-the-point-of-unbelievability fictional American president, I\u2019d watch the West Wing and ignore the bigoted parts.I also think the scene with the Queen of England was Cringe Central. Again, not realistic, just completely good politics versus completely bad politics depending on which better serves the plot.This just felt...very juvenile. And I\u2019m not saying that romance novels need to have the best ever take on politics. I\u2019m not even saying that I was reading this book FOR the politics.All I\u2019m saying is...I care about politics and seeing it idealized and completely unrealistic took me out of the story??(Can I say the word politics more.)Anyway. Even that was not enough to take away from this book so much for it to be a negative rating or an unenjoyable read.But...it was a takeaway. (SORRY.)Bottom line: Casey McQuiston give me your next book immediately please, and also thank you for not writing it about politics. (OKAY I\u2019M DONE USING THE WORD POLITICS NOW.)----------nothing but respect for MY (alternate reality where the fictional president from this book is the actual) presidentreview to come / 3.5 or 4 stars idk----------i'm a simple girl. i see a bajillion five star reviews of a contemporary, i read that contemporary", "\nAlex, the First Son, has one arch-nemesis: Prince Henry of England, the Crown\u2019s golden boy.

After all, Alex hates Henry! \u2026 doesn\u2019t he?\nOkay, look, I don\u2019t even know how to start this review so I\u2019m just going to apologize in advance for my fangirling, because honestly, it\u2019s really just NOT fair at all that we\u2019re less than three months into the year and I\u2019ve probably already found my favorite book of the year.

There\u2019s a fair amount of sex (though the scenes are all tame and mostly vague if that\u2019s something you\u2019re worried about), and even when everyone is fully clothed, the tension is off the charts. They\u2019re so sweet together and they wear their little hearts on their sleeves and I adored everything about the perfect OTP that is Alex and Henry. \u2665 Also, their text and email conversations? KILL ME WITH CUTENESS, CASEY MCQUISTON, JUST DO IT.\nWhatever, fine. Henry is annoyingly attractive. That\u2019s always been a thing, objectively. It\u2019s fine.\nI think the last thing I want to say is just how optimistic and downright hopeful this book is. Without spoiling anything, there\u2019s a scene towards the end that is just pure queer affirmation and support and love and it had me bawling the happiest tears at the thought. The world is a really ugly place sometimes (especially in US politics lately) and I cherished every moment of this escape and this view into what we\u2019re hopefully moving towards.All quotes come from an advance copy and may not match the final release. Thank you so much to St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing me with this ARC in exchange for an honest review!", "its official. im now in a diabetic coma because my blood sugar levels are too high from how sweet this story is. its seriously too precious. its the perfect remedy for all your worries, troubles, and depression. and that is due to the boys - what sweet cinnamon rolls alex and henry are. to love this story is to love them. plain and simple. i do think this would have been a 5 star read for me if it had been told in first person and from henrys POV. i think that would have made the writing much more relatable and not as forced, like it seemed to be at times. and it would have also saved me from all the dull american politics. i get enough of that IRL that i dont need it polluting such a nice and fluffy story. i would have much rather read about the royal family instead. i think those changes would have made this a much more perfect story for me personally. but all in all, i think this is deserving of all the hype its currently getting!\u21a0 4 stars", "Alex Claremont-Diaz, First Son of the United States, is making his way through college, as well as plotting his future career in politics. He already has years of experience working on various campaigns and that is truly where he sees his life going. Along with his sister and best friend, they navigate the D.C. social scene like it's their job; and it kind of is.We all know I love political strategy in books, so right from the start, I'm like...It quickly becomes obvious that Alex still has some growing up to do. As he should, he's in his early-20s, y'all, give the boy a break! He parties a little too hard, hooks up with randoms who are then forced to sign ND agreements and feuds with foreign dignitaries. #relatableAlex's biggest rival is Prince Henry. Henry is all sorts of swoony, totally exuding a Prince Charming vibe, but Alex sees him as a bore and his number one enemy. When an incident between Alex and Henry occurs at a royal wedding, the boys are forced to pretend to be friends in order to save face.Alex would rather do pretty much anything else. Unfortunately, his wants are fairly inconsequential at this point, and so begins the relationship that will melt you; heart, body and soul.If you are reading this, I am sure you already know what this book entails. It received so much hype and for good reason. A mainstream title that is a humorous and steamy New Adult romance, featuring a male/male, enemies-to-lovers relationship? This is basically the book the world has been waiting for. And let's be honest, it's a book the world needs.I personally was swept away from the very first pages. It is so fun. Pure fun on the page but also thoughtful in its presentation. I truly feel this is ground-breaking and we will all be talking about it for years to come. McQuiston did such a great job of making this so contemporary and natural without in any way feeling forced. The dialogue was super believable and the storyline provided a lot of food for thought.I have heard a few people mention that it is too optimistic?? To me, I didn't really think so. It is a happy story overall but our characters have struggles just like real people. Alex and Henry both grapple with their sexuality and what that means in terms of their lives, their family's responses, the world's response; they really struggled with that. There's no question, they had hard decisions to make, just like in real life.As far as the overall outcome, I think we needed a book like this. (view spoiler)[Shouldn't we be striving for a world like this? Where this could be a reality? Where the majority of the people would stand on the side of what is right instead of hiding behind the curtains of tradition? (hide spoiler)]I applaud Casey for writing this. I think this will mean a heck of a lot to a lot of people and McQuiston is definitely on my list of autobuy authors after this spectacular debut! Bravo!Thank you so much to the publisher, St. Martin's Press, for providing me with a copy of this to read and review. I always appreciate the opportunity. I think this will be making a lot of reader's 'Best of 2019' lists!", "Not for me. That\u2019s an understatement. I get that a lot of people loved this, and I can see why. It has its charms and I\u2019m sure that, for a lot of people, it was a fun escape. I can respect that. But I am clearly not the intended audience for this. It\u2019s a diatribe of smug, naive American exceptionalism against a stereotyped, sterilised, Anglocentric image of the UK that masquerades as anti-monarchist but ultimately worships the royal family as an institution. The author clearly knows nothing about how the UK works (\u201cPrime Minister of England\u201d) or about its culture (people in the streets waving \u201cthe Union Jack\u201d and Alex wanting to \"scream at this stupid country\" while he's standing in the middle of a fucking NHS hospital ward) yet this book presents itself as some kind of authority on current issues. Our supposedly woke prince makes a tasteless joke about waterboarding and fawns over famed coloniser James I while no actual pressing issues are touched upon in any substantial way: Brexit, poor and injured people dying on Universal Credit, Scottish separatism, the revolving door at parliament, the Grenfell Tower atrocity. It only chews and chews on stupid irrelevant quips about the monarchy\u2019s bloody history, making the same mistake as others in its genre - dehumanising the actual people living on the actual streets here, as if the monarchy is in any way relevant to regular people\u2019s daily lives, and presenting the crown as being some kind of political body, which it isn\u2019t (and simultaneously ignoring the fact that the monarch is actually a religious leader as supreme governor of the Church of England). This book clearly wants to be patted on the back for being \u201ccurrent\u201d without actually knowing anything about anything.Similarly, the main character is a rude, judgemental, insufferable arsehole and the narrative tickles him under the chin for it. He is not only ignorant but also outwardly cruel, all of his \u201chumour\u201d being at the expense of others and usually behind their backs. His claim about wanting to make the world a better place made me laugh out loud. The central relationship had some cute moments but was highly unrealistic and dysfunctional. Let me tell you something: a person who invites you into their bed, in your most vulnerable state, and then proceeds to say things like \u201cfuck you, you\u2019re insufferable, you\u2019re the worst, I hate you, you\u2019re a bastard\u201d is not worth your time. It\u2019s disrespectful and for me personally it was very uncomfortable to read. The \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d dichotomy of American politics, particularly the glorification of two-party politics, also left a horrible taste in my mouth. I am not against heavy critiques of reprehensible Republican policies - far, far from it - but ignoring the historical corruption also present amongst the Democratic party and presenting them as some kind of untouchable, perfectly woke force for good is utterly disingenuous. If you\u2019re going to talk about politics, at least do it honestly. I'm never ever going to be interested in narratives of good vs. evil, and in this political climate, especially when you're barging into foreign politics and using the names and brands of real political parties, this \"rose-tinted\" outlook is totally unhelpful and foolish. To put the cherry on the top, there is a lot of shallow talk about how terrible empire is as a concept (fair enough, and absolutely true) but with no self awareness whatsoever. The fact that America also has an empire is quickly handwaved. Apparently crimes against humanity are only bad when other people do them. Aside from all of this, there are some fun moments, but only if you have a high tolerance for cheesiness. The writing is mostly serviceable, but there are also sentences like this: \u201cThey grew up made to talk about their feelings a lot\u201d. Jesus christ. It\u2019s a no from me.", "Wow, this book was EVEN BETTER than I had dared hope. : )\n\nI'd initially held off on requesting this book until early reviews hit Goodreads because: 1.) Royal*anything* usually bores me to tears.2.) So do books involving politics of any shape or form.But this story was a delicious mix of drama, angst, excitement and, most importantly, hope.I loved both First Son Alex and HRH Prince Henry right from the get go, as they first snarked their way into my heart, then as feelings began to develop, gave me enough banter to keep me laughing every few pages.[Mexican-American Alex:]\n\nI also found the side characters to be a delight, from First Daughter June to Second Daughter Nora to Princess Beatrice to Alex's parents and friends. They were all worthy of their places in the story, only adding to my level of interest.As the story began, Alex's intense dislike for \"HRH Prince Dickhead\" wasn't really addressed in-depth; however, once their first meeting was detailed out, I have to admit that I didn't care much for Henry, either.Then after they were forced to spend time together as pretend BFF's, trying to undo damage to international relations at a Royal wedding, Henry's staunch fa\u00e7ade began to slip and we got to see glimpses of the boy behind the unfeeling, arrogant mask. And I *loved* him from there on out.[Prince Henry:]\n\nThis was basically your \"boy is enamored of boy, finally meets boy, get slighted by boy, hates boy, then they work through their shit, eventually falling madly in love\" story and it totally worked for me.\n\nYes, there was lots of political speak, with Alex's mother being POTUS, and Henry's grandmother being the Queen of England, but it never got to be too much, as humor, feelings, and just... *realness* permeated the pages.\n\nThere was also a ton of political intrigue, with an unexpected act of betrayal, which I felt made the book more than less interesting for me. That was a big ole' shock and a departure from my norm, let me tell you.For all of you Steam Queens out there, while the sex scenes were not entirely fade to black, they were definitely more *emotive* than descriptive or explicit. If I'm remembering correctly, I don't think the book even contained the words 'penis' or 'dick', other than when Alex would adoringly call Henry a dickhead. I was actually fine with the lack of traditional heat, though.I did have a few niggles, Firstly, at 432 (reported) pages, the story felt suuuuuper long, although I never found myself bored. At times, the pacing felt a bit on the slow side, but the humor did its job in keeping me engaged.Secondly, PRESENT TENSE. Ugh. \u2018Nuff said.\n\nLastly, OMMFG, Henry's propensity to imitate Carl Lewis, pulling a runner and ghosting Alex on more than one occasion, nearly drove me to goddamn drink. True story.\n\nBut Alex wasn't one to be ignored, fortunately, so if a bitch needed read, he was the right man for the job, always pulling these two adorable dumbasses back onto The Road to True Love, capitalized, because it's 'a thing' .I'm extremely happy that I stepped out of my usual comfort zone and gave this book a chance, and would rate it at around 4.75 stars for the humor and feels.-----------------------------------------------My ARC copy of the book was provided by the publisher in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.See All My Latest Reads (Review Quick-Links)-----------------------------------------------", "REREAD: December 2019 Alex Claremont-Diaz is the only man I would die for.

We\u2019re supposed to conceive of this book as a sort of gay Chasing Liberty meets Parks and Recreation: a heartfelt, optimistic, unfailingly patriotic romp where the stars are, yeah, two hot dudes, but they\u2019re carried on the broad, benevolent shoulders of Lady Liberty. President Ellen Claremont is a white, Southern, centrist Democrat--because, sure, this is an alternate universe, but let\u2019s not go wild--with two children, wannabe journalist June and politics-obsessed Alex. Alex\u2019s arch nemesis for about 5 percent of the book is Prince Henry of Wales, and then he\u2019s his secret boyfriend for the next 90 percent. At the end, they\u2019re outed by Ellen\u2019s political rival, which results in him soundly losing the election against her and turning Texas blue.CM writes in the acknowledgements that this book started as a fun project and, after the course of the actual 2016 election, became a sort of therapeutic, wish-fulfilling exercise. I get that; I wrote fanfiction about Pete Wentz being my boyfriend in the 6th grade, so why not a President!Hillary AU? I don\u2019t begrudge her that. My issue is that someone else picked up this book and thought it was a good idea to publish it.There are so many little things that make this book bad: the fact that Alex and Henry are \u201carch rivals\u201d for literally about ten pages until they\u2019re kissing, and then there\u2019s no plot for a hundred pages; this whole minor plotline where the First Family gets caught with a private email server that reads like a smug joke (\u201cmaybe this would matter in some OTHER America, but not this one!\u201d); Alex wearing a red white and blue Gucci bomber jacket instead of a suit as if it\u2019s some world-ending transgression; when the First Family and two of the royal siblings go to a gay bar in West Hollywood and no other patrons post any photos or sell any quotes to gossip magazines...I could honestly go on forever. These are the stupid things we\u2019re not supposed to criticize because this is a \u201cfun\u201d book, so I won\u2019t.How about instead, we talk about when Henry says \u201cI\u2019d rather be waterboarded...Your country could probably arrange that,\u201d and we\u2019re supposed to see that as a cute zinger. Or when Ellen says \u201cMy UN ambassador...said something idiotic about Israel, so now I have to call Netanyahu and personally apologize.\u201d And then we move on to pizza and beer. The problem with this book isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s overly precious and poorly paced; the problem is that it is trying to be both Veep and House of Cards. It exists in a world where we are to believe that a prince \u201crefusing the crown\u2019s money\u201d (as if he isn\u2019t steeped in it, as if he doesn\u2019t benefit from it every minute he\u2019s alive) is somehow the apex of morality. It exists in an America where email servers don\u2019t matter in an election. It exists in a Britain where a prince would say \u201cOne does not foster a lifelong love of Star Wars without knowing an \u2018empire\u2019 isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d These cutesy one-liners and feel-good plotlines do nothing to contend with the imperial violence they\u2019re hinting at, violence from which Alex and Henry both benefit. Okay, so Ellen chats with Netanyahu and June wants to be bffs with Ronan Farrow. Following these fun details to their logical conclusion, I can only assume that Ellen orders drone strikes in the Middle East and Henry\u2019s grandmother is a violent racist. If I were supposed to be having a good time reading, that notion would certainly jerk me out of it quickly. The point this book misses is that it doesn\u2019t matter how liberal the President is\u2014the system is still a gruesome, ever-grinding machine. This book isn\u2019t absolved from that reality, not when it makes glib references to war criminals and WikiLeaks.If this book had leaned harder into its Disney Channel inclinations, this would be a much different review. My Date With the President\u2019s Daughter and What a Girl Wants and The Princess Diaries, all members of the canon to which this book belongs, were successful (to varying degrees) because the idea of the President or the Queen were distant, hazy fantasies rather than political and imperial figures. If Will Friedle had leveraged his relationship with President Richmond\u2019s daughter to pass stricter gun legislation, the movie would have approximated the tone of this book. It\u2019s a jarring, unwieldy juxtaposition.Even if we leave all of the politics out of it, there isn\u2019t much to redeem here. The sex scenes are jarring; in a break with modern romance conventions, CM describes the undressing and kissing in vivid, pages-long detail, then quickly skirts past sex. It reads like Harry Styles/Louis Tomlinson fanfiction written by someone who gets all of the angst but none of the mechanics. And this brings us to my theory: why this goddamn book?Others have described this phenomenon in more depth--these thoughts aren\u2019t mine alone. And I want to note before we get into it that I know CM isn\u2019t straight. But when we look at who gets famous writing about young men falling in love with one another, we\u2019re certainly not looking at a room full of men. By and large, the people who write this stuff are, as far as the publishing world and audiences at large perceive them, white women writing for a white woman audience. Regardless of their intentions and the complexities of their personal identities, that\u2019s the lens through which their books are marketed and purchased. Publishers see the success of Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda and The Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Vice and Virtue and they want more of the same--big on the pining and handsome young guys, light on the details of men having sex with each other. This book isn\u2019t coming out because it\u2019s a beautiful tale of gay love despite challenging circumstances. It\u2019s coming out because some suits saw dollar signs.So, let\u2019s review: this book is painfully unaware of how painfully unaware it is; it\u2019s an ice cream truck driving through an apocalyptic wasteland. Sure, ice cream rules, but are we just gonna ignore how utterly useless it is in the current landscape? And isn\u2019t it a little offensive that it\u2019s blaring \u201cGod Bless America\u201das it goes? Shouldn\u2019t we feel a little miffed that someone thought to send us ice cream when we really need a damn life raft?

I've been struggling to focus on books lately, but dude I stayed up very late reading this -- and also possibly sprained a rib from laughing so much. But perfect banter and adorable romance...what really took me was how heartfelt the book was, the characters were. It's a story about being brave enough to admit you are worth fighting for, for wanting things, and for chasing after those things. And thathit me in all sorts of emotional ways.So basically the president's son and the prince of England have an unofficial rivalry... which leads to a crush and a surprise-attack kiss and the very smack-in-the-face realisation that they've loved each other for a long long time. UGH IT WAS ADORABLE. It was also a lot of sex, lol, which reminded me why I stick to YA mostly. But I just loved how the romance was handled. There's angst yes, but their main issues was them vs the world...instead of angsty do-you-love-me-do-you-not which I am Not Fond Of. So thank you for that. Also I just ship these two idiots \ud83d\ude2dAlex is 21 and doesn't even know he's bi and Henry is 23 and living so deeply undercover because the British Crown is not allowed to be gay, that he believes he doesn't even deserve to be happy. I just...these two. (Also their second kiss-scene? lmao.)also it was refreshing to read about Alex still figuring out his sexuality. His crisis was hilarious and endearing and relatable ajfkdslad and I just loved him. He's so brash and 10/10 to the moment where he stands in front of the palace swearing at Henry to come talk to him. Like THIS KID. Alex is an explosion, a mess, a heartfelt and emotional fire. Henry is stillness and smooth smiles and he's like a shot bullet, unchangeable, when he gets going. And a moment for June and Nora. Henry's sister and best friend respectively. Like they were the best, so clever, and the kind of women I love reading about. And give me the spin-off where they fall in love, u cowards, i need it.The politics part? I have no idea what's going on. No idea. All the politics scenes were pretty much lost on me, but I did like how driven and intelligent all the characters were. (It just made me feel like Gansey from The Raven Cycle would be at home with this lot ok.)I can't even with how hilarious it was. The banter was perfect and the quips were absolutely the best and I JUST. LOVED. THE. DIALOGUE.And look, it's definitely a sweet book with lots of fluffy scenes. Which I loved. (Although I could never relax, I always thought they'd get busted.) But it also touches on so many deeper topics: closeted queerness and actually how damaging that is to you, it explores what it is to be bi, it talks about oppression for women (specifically in politics) and for POC (Alex and June are biracial Mexican). And books always rob my heartbeat when they are about people who will fight for each other and their love.

As for me, I'm gonna keep it in my handbag just in case I ever need cheering up, with the absolute certainty that it will never disappoint.\n\"Sugar, I cannot express to you how much the press does not give a fuck about who started what,\" Ellen says. \"As your mother, I can appreciate that maybe this isn't your fault, but as the president, all I want is to have the CIA fake your death and ride the dead-kid sympathy into a second term.\"\n\n\nThis is 2019 and the USA elected their first woman as POTUS three years ago. Alright, do take a second to cry a bit, I'll be there whenever you're ready. You okay? Alright. Red, White & Royal Blue follows 21 years-old Alex Claremont-Diaz - the Mexican-American First Son the United States don't deserve but should dream for - while he's sloooowly realizing that:\u2460 Henry the Prince of Wales is really the Leia to his Han Solo and oh, not the stuck-up jerk he always thought he was;\u2461 Ethical Issues in International Relations are some bullshit;\u2462 Wanting to kiss the fuck out of the aforementioned Prince probably means that he's bisexual and I mean what the hell, nobody's ever telling him shit... and I mean what are words? My god, I do not know. Reading Red, White & Royal Blue was such an uplifting experience, I had to do that's too cute breaks. What's that, you ask? Well it's like, you're reading, but it's TOO MUCH and you just HAVE to take a break and smile/hiss/squeal/clap and that's entirely too ridiculous for anyone to see you that way so you'll 100% hide if someone comes but you just CAN'T HELP IT and it's glorious and it makes the book go on way longer because you KEEP DOING IT every two pages and sometimes you stand up and you JUMP and did I say that you would hide??? I visited my mum this week and (yes it's relevant) I don't usually read as much there but here I was, at 3 fucking am, squealing and whispering alone in my room, it's so cute omg it's so cute!!!!!ANYWAY. My thoughts are all over the place so I decided to pull off a classic ADHD move and make a list, because why the fuck not?\n\n\u278a ALEX. Our biracial FSOTUS is infuriating and narcissistic but we keep thinking stuff like, OKAY FAIR ENOUGH. He's very much likeable and entirely too much but ohmygod he's so funny and endearing, his confusion and GAH, everything?? I adore him and I want to wrap him in a tight hug even though he would probably tell me that he hates me but oh well, still worth it. Moreover, it's not present in text and I might be projecting so proceed with caution but I read Alex as having ADHD. His hyperfocus, his insomnia and his general behavior were really relatable to me, honestly.[UPDATE: the author answered me on twitter and confirmed that Alex had undiagnosed ADHD *cries* I'M SO HAPPY]\nHe's absolutely sure that guys who kissed the Prince of England and liked it don't get elected to represent Texas.\n\u278b Hmm, Henry, obviously? I've never been invested in anything even loosely related to the British royal family (imperialism and genocides ruin cute boys, don't you think) but I swear that if someday they manage to create a gay cinnamon roll even half as interesting than Henry, I would be. I mean at some point I wrote a note with HENRY IS THE ONLY BEST PRINCE AND THAT IS ALL. Hahaha I know, dramatic much? But he made me cry, okay? The persona he has to manufacture in order to survive his family's crushing expectations truly broke my heart. \n\"Alex?\" Henry's voice sounds scratchy and bewildered across the line. \"Have you really rung me at three o'clock in the morning to make me listen to a turkey?\"\"Yes, obviously,\" Alex says. He glances at Cornbread and cringes. \"Jesus Christ, it's like they can see into your soul.\"\u278c The hate-to-fake friends-to why do I want to text you all day every day-to wow that's some kiss-to lovers romance. It was GLORIOUS, absolute perfection and my expectations for romance novels dramatically increased, it's ridiculous. My go-to move when I need cheering up is now rambling endlessly about the utter perfection that is Alex and Henry's relationship and I'm not even sorry about it. *cough* Em *cough*\n\n(also look at us talking in English when we both speak French LMAO) \u278d The splendid characterization: indeed Casey McQuiston created a full cast of well-rounded characters all equally interesting and diverse. BRAVO. \u278e The friendships and family dynamics are truly amazing? When an author manages to make you want to be part of her characters' lives, it's without any doubt a win. As I'm one second from boarding a plane to meet people that do not exist, I am confident that Casey McQuiston rocked it. June, Nora, Zahra, Amy, Zahra, Bea, Ellen - I adore them all. \n\"Stop trying to Jane Austen my life!\" he yells back.\"Listen, it's not my fault he's a mysterious and retiring young royal and you're the tempestuous ing\u00e9nue that caught his eye, okay?\"He laughs and tries to crawl away, even as she claws at his ankle and wallops another pillow at his head.\n\u278f After two years of a white supremacist squatting in the white house it's just really exhilarating to read about Alex's democrat mum as POTUS, and at some point it felt so real that let me tell you, coming back to Earth was HARD. Besides, I really enjoyed the political part of the plot. It does waver a bit but honestly, I was never bored, so? Plus she was such a supportive mum, I loved her so much. \nThe next slide is titled : EXPLORING YOUR SEXUALITY: HEALTHY, BUT DOES IT HAVE TO BE WITH THE PRINCE OF ENGLAND?\n\u2790 THE MARVELOUS TREATS THAT ARE HENRY AND ALEX'S EMAILS. I might have highlighted *whispers* everything. Mostly they're full of our boys being so fucking adorable it hurts but they also include quotes from queer historical figures and reading them was magnificent? \n- Have been home for three hours. Already miss you. This is some bullshit.- It is, indeed, bullshit. It's all I can do not to pack a bag and be gone forever. Perhaps I could live in your room like a recluse. You could have food sent up to me, and I'll be lurking in disguise in a shadowy corner when you answer the door. It'll all be very dreadfully Jane Eyre.\n\u2791 Alex's humorous voice and more generally, the writing. Casey McQuiston's words just flow smoothly and the story is not only perfectly paced - there are weird jumps in time but it's mostly a formatting issue and I presume that it'll be taken care of in the finished copy - but also effortlessly funny and compelling. Most of the time you're either smiling wildly or tearing up, and that's some achievement right there. \nThe phrase \"see attached bibliography\" is the single sexiest thing you have ever written to me.\n\u25b8 I've been rereading quotes all day and ugh, I can't stop smiling it's unbearable and mostly I want to shove them down your face and scream NOW YOU GET IT????CW - anxiety, panic attack, homophobia, public outing *arc kindly provided by St Martin's Press and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

This is going to be the unpopular opinion of the book. \ud83d\ude01 I was really ecstatic when I got an ARC of this book two months ago. I was seriously so happy. \ud83d\ude42 And I started reading it and it was enjoyable until the politics stuff started. I paused at 50% mark for one month and couldn\u2019t bring myself to continue reading it. I was that bored of the book. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But when I saw this is finally released and everyone and their mothers in my friend list have given this book 5 stars, I thought at least I owed it to the other readers to have a diverse and honest opinion on this book instead of me DNFing it because I was bored. \ud83d\ude36First of all, I had such high expectations on this book. I mean a romance between the prince of England and the son of the US president? It surely is gay equivalent of a fairytale. In my opinion, \u201cthe idea of this book worked better than the actual book\u201d. And I think the main reason why this didn\u2019t work for me because I\u2019m not an American. \ud83d\ude42 I try to keep up with the politics and I have general idea about how things work. However, I have no idea about how the whole US presidency campaigns or elections work and ... and ... this is a big \u201cbut\u201d, I\u2019m NOT interested in learning how it works in this book. If I wanted some knowledge about presidency or campaigns or how the whole system works, I would have read a book about past presidents memoirs, biographies or related books on that subject. I expected romance and instead I got a really long lecture about how the system works which again, I\u2019m not interested. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And the way the royal family of England was portrayed, I think it was a bit \u201cassuming too much\u201d? Especially how the fictional queen was portrayed, obstinate, air-head figure head who only considers about rules and her decorum .. it grated a bit of wrong nerves for me. I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t love the romance between Alex and Henry. It does get better especially after they were very publicly outed. But I wish I got more of them instead of info dump. \ud83d\ude05 Again, if you are an American, by all means, you are very likely to love it wayyyyyyy more than I did but for me, it was expectations fell very short. It read more like a political propaganda than a romance to me. \ud83d\ude11 Call me shallow, I wanted my gay fairytale and not elections and campaigns and White House speeches. I guess I\u2019ll stay away from mainstream LGBT books for awhile now. \ud83d\ude422.75 Not really a fairytale stars\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1fDisclaimer: An advanced review copy of this book was provided by the author via NetGalley for an honest and unbiased review.

Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in.\" --Margaret Atwood", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549292344l/42975172.jpg", "title": "The Testaments", "authors": "Margaret Atwood", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42975172-the-testaments", "reviews": ["I guess I'll have to be the one who says what nobody else is willing to say. This novel is terrible, and Booker judges are starstruck, hype-driven sellouts. And that no professional literary critic has the guts to tell the truth about how poorly conceived and written The Testaments is, is a true shame.  I can't decide which work Atwood should be embarrassed for more - Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 or The Testaments. The book doesn't read like a novel written by one of the most lauded authors of the 20st century. The Testaments reads like a standard-issue feminist YA dystopia, filled with every overused dystopian trope and every stereotype, penned by an author who writes for teen audience, and is published by Harper Teen. As such, it undoubtedly has some appeal to a part of Atwood's readership, but literary merit The Testaments has none. If this book had a different name on it, I would have DNFed it after 50 pages for its lack of originality, predictability and mediocre writing style. I\u2019ve read a fair number of similar novels, I am not opposed to them, I enjoyed some of them, and some of them (for example the upcoming The Grace Year) held my attention much better. As an Atwood novel, The Testaments gets one disappointed, angry, heart-broken star from me. Why did the publishers embargo Atwood's new creation, I wonder? Surely there is nothing to spoil. Maybe to conceal its poor execution, or its transparent, shallow, simplistic, and ridiculous plot? The story is told from 3 POVs - Aunt Lydia's and two teen girls' - one growing up in Gilead and another - in Canada. Oh my, who those girls might be? Twist! You can only glimpse Atwood's former brilliance in Aunt Lydia's POV, but just for a few moments here and there. If the whole novel was written about Aunt Lydia, maybe Atwood would have made her journey more convincing, but alas. The other two girls are quintessential YA dystopian heroines - one abused by an evil oppressive regime, and the other - a bratty teen on the run from bad people, but who nevertheless has time for some romance. Yum! Like I said, these POVs are so similar to what's been regurgitated over and over in teen publishing, it's uncanny. Has The Testaments been partially ghost-written by Lauren Oliver? I am not trying to dump on Oliver, she has her fans and her place in the industry, but I expected something infinitely more sophisticated from Margaret Atwood.The new information about Gilead Atwood promised? Well, new details of Gilead made the regime more nonsensical and less plausible than ever before. Who benefits from living in Gilead becomes unfathomable in this book, thus making the entire concept pointless (kind of like in Wither). Totalitarian regimes work, at least temporarily, because they are supported by a mass of true believers. Where are they in this book? But if you yearn for some more torture porn in addition to that supplied by the 3 seasons of the TV show, then sure. Rapists, molesters, killers, suicide victims galore, plus solitary confinement - there is an overabundance of that. All of it written bluntly, rashly, exploitatively and without any kind of nuance. There is no overarching theme in The Testaments except GILEAD IS BAD. The plot to overthrow it is a joke. If you are looking for a clever, thoughtful, well-written companion to The Handmaid's Tale, you are out of luck. If you want a bland, basic TV show fanfic ripe with action adventure and genre tropes, enjoy! The Testaments was written just for you.", "I can sum it up simply: this book is not needed. I hoped that wouldn't be the case. I really really hoped Atwood had something important to add to the world of Gilead with this book, but she honestly doesn't. If anything, The Testaments serves only to weaken the power of The Handmaid's Tale.In the past, I have spoken highly of authors who are not afraid to \"be evil\" with their books. This may give the impression that they are doing something particularly nefarious, but, in fact, it\u2019s not so much something they do, but everything they don\u2019t. It\u2019s an act of self-restraint to not say everything, to leave some things unanswered, some happy endings unexplored. That, I feel, is one of the greatest strengths of The Handmaid's Tale.Because there is so much we don't know; can't know. Everything we experience comes from Offred's narrow world view. Everything Offred doesn't know-- we don't know. The ending, too, is famously ambiguous. And these are extremely powerful tools. What we don\u2019t know is powerful. Ambiguity is powerful. Knowing when to finish is powerful. As Aunt Lydia notes herself in this very book:\nWhere there is emptiness, the mind will obligingly fill it up. Fear is always at hand to supply any vacancies, as is curiosity.\nThe Handmaid's Tale forces us to wonder, to imagine, to fear the worst and hope for the best. The Testaments not so much. What this book does is remove the ambiguity. It provides answers to thirty-five year old mysteries that were best left unanswered. I am reminded somewhat comically of Jojo Moyes' inability to let go of her Me Before You characters, repeatedly opening up the story after leaving it on an emotional high. Not every \"ooh, I wonder what the characters did next?\" should be answered. Sometimes not knowing is so much more effective. And that's Moyes. I didn't expect Atwood to indulge in this sentimentality. The Handmaid's Tale uses one limited perspective to make us think; The Testaments uses three perspectives and an epilogue in the future to colour in all the corners, leaving nothing to the imagination. I gave this book two stars for Aunt Lydia's perspective. Without her contribution I am honestly not sure I would have pushed through the second half of the book. The rest of the book is told from the perspective of two teenage girls, one living in Canada and the other in Gilead, and the \"twists\" regarding them are so glaringly obvious that it is actually a bit embarrassing to read the scenes with the dramatic reveals (chapter cliffhanger obviously). The whole infiltration by the resistance thing was straight out of every other dime a dozen dystopia.I had so hoped this was going to do something new and important. I hoped it was going to impart a new message, perhaps relevant to modern times. I hoped it was going to be smart and thought-provoking. I am disappointed. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "Return to GileadCheck your expectations at the door: \nThe Testaments\n is a highly entertaining page turner, but it is also probably quite different from whatever you were anticipating.It differs from its 1985 antecedent, The Handmaid's Tale, in tone, voice and literary heft. That earlier book had a power and a gravitas that is not recaptured here. For me the most striking thing about The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has always been Atwood\u2019s choice of narrator. Offred (in the book she has no other name) is so confined by her circumstances; her isolation is claustrophobic. She is essentially passive, keeping her head down and daring to aim only for survival, while other characters have more agency (Moira and Ofglen both find proactive ways to thwart the Gilead regime, either would have been a more natural choice for a protagonist). Offred is an Everywoman \u2013 with her passivity she confronts the reader: Well, what would you do in my place? And don't kid yourself. It's bleak, but the novel's power is in its intimate portrait of powerlessness. The Testaments is more action-driven, more hopeful, and by extension, less realistic. We follow three characters who are prepared to buck the system, to risk everything to crush the patriarchy. That two of them are teenagers feeds the sense of buoyancy, you get the feeling that Atwood too thinks the kids are gonna save us.The shift in tone will be familiar to viewers of Hulu's TV series \u2014 perhaps both Atwood and the showrunners 'read the room' and recognised that the catharsis of a feelgood fightback is what we crave and need most right now. If the idea of a book set in Gilead being entertaining \u2014 even fun \u2014 dismays you, best skip this one. Indeed The Testaments, rather shrewdly on Atwood's part, functions as a sequel to both the first book AND the TV adaptation \u2014 deftly combining elements from each, while avoiding the show's most glaring faults (eg its over-reliance on a single character, and tendency to get bogged down plot-wise).This novel isn't flawless either. One of the narrative voices is by far more compelling than the others (no prizes for guessing that it's the mature, morally compromised Aunt Lydia, not one of the idealistic teenagers). It's a little too TV-ready in the way the characters intersect. Certain plot twists are loudly telegraphed and the narratives don't always jive with the historical documents they purport to be. And my eyes rolled more than once (Underground Femaleroad, really?).Still there's much to enjoy. The conniving duplicity and monstrous ambivalence of Aunt Lydia makes for thrilling reading. Atwood's prose and story-spinning have lost none of their magic, and for an 80 year old she writes teenage voices surprisingly well! Most importantly, it's compulsively readable. The Testaments is unlikely to become a perennially relevant classic like its predecessor, and it's unreasonable to expect that kind of greatness from it. As an expansion of the Gilead mythos though, it more than satisfies.", "Winner of best fiction category but it\u2019s not my winner. That\u2019s my opinion and I respect fans\u2019 opinions \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23 Two stars for the love of Aunt Lydia! If she wasn\u2019t in this book, I could do something first by giving minus five stars to a book! See how I disliked and how I felt frustrated about this hope stealing, time wasting, one of the biggest failures of the year!!!! One of the tasteless testament you could ever have!2019 could be one of this year I got really disappointed by movies, series books. They were like several ugly stabs to your stomach. I was unlucky to read Cari Mora ( After 13 years of waiting patiently Thomas Harris released this\u2026hmm\u2026itshouldnotbenamed, yes this is worse than Voldemort!), Mister( My bad, I shouldn\u2019t pick this one! The joke is on me!), several romance books released by Jewel E. Ann, Karina Halle, K. A. Tucker, Renee Carlino etc. I watched GOT\u2019s final and started to fantasize how to punch the screenwriters who are also series-killers (worse occupation than being serial killer) in 101 different ways!And now I\u2019m holding a book which is the worst betrayal to the memory of Handmaid\u2019s Tale, one of the best dystopian books that have ever been written.I didn\u2019t understand the writer\u2019s motive stick to the characters of their previous works. Did I want to know what happened to June? Never, I just wanted to move on and get rid of terrifying, penetrating, mind numbing affect to book left on me. And here we are with 3 different POVs- Aunt Lydia(If it wasn\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t add two more stars, but at least her parts kept me reading more because too many times I wanted to drop it and added to my DNF and HNITF-have no intention to finish- list) and two teenage girls ( one from Canada and one from Gilead). I really think, on those teenagers\u2019 narration parts, the author stopped writing and summoned her interns who returned back from getting her clothes from dry-cleaner and her coffee orders and made them take her seat and write all those parts as she had a meeting with Hulu for the future episodes of Handmaid\u2019s Tale.And twisty part about teenagers, oh please you don\u2019t need to have spider senses to foresee it, even my ten years old nephew caught the surprise when I told him some specifics about the book. (I\u2019m good with kids and their intellectual evaluation) What about the details of Gilead? Still senseless, illogical and more irritating than before. True believers supporting the system work properly. But I just wanted to learn something new, different, exploring something astonishing, shocking and more provoking. But no\u2026nada\u2026 Now I\u2019m sulking, fists clenched but this time as a big change I don\u2019t want to punch any characters, I think the creator of them more deserved my slaps. I already sent my bill to the publishers for wasting my priceless time for nothing.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "\nI haven't even finished season 2 of the tv show since it was so emotionally draining but here I am reading this!!\n", "\nA review in 5 words: Unnecessary. Pointless. Ruining. Bland. Spoilers.\n", "This was my most anticipated book for 2019.Wait... I should amend that statement...THIS WAS THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK OF MY MISERABLE FRIGGIN LIFE!And much like my life, it was an epic disappointment.The Handmaid's Tale is on my Top 10 shelf. It is, in my opinion, the greatest dystopian novel of all time. It is everything you expect from the genre and more. Shocking, terrifying, an unflinching account of a fucking nightmarish scenario that could actually happen. At the end of The Handmaid's Tale I was left devastated and bereft of words. I loved the ambiguity and found myself never wanting to know what happened to June. I consider this decision by Atwood to be the crowning achievement of the novel.With The Testaments Atwood took that crown and crushed it beneath her pen.Obliterated it.And nearly took The Handmaid's Tale with it.", "It's not easy being the most anticipated book of the year. I would argue that most of the negative reactions - including my own - are based largely on expectations. Since published in 1985, The Handmaid's Tale has become sacred ground in the literary world; a true modern classic further amplified by the successful show and current political tensions. Stakes for a sequel couldn't be higher and, even for the ever-talented Margaret Atwood, that's a tough performance to deliver. All in all, this is a well-written adventure story that expands the world building hinted at and alluded to by the original. But it's also boring, mostly unsurprising, and generally feels like a cash-in opportunity.More specifically, I was turned off by all the young characters. About 67% of the book is narrated by youth. Their lack of maturity creates a Middle Grade narrative voice that is jarring and undesired. Not necessarily unrealistic, just annoying. Their kiddish thoughts go on for pages and pages when a few brief lines would have sufficed to assure us these characters are indeed children. Another downer is how many questions this book doesn't answer. The original ended with such a dramatic cliffhanger, but the unresolved threads there remain largely unresolved here. I won't say which ones to keep this spoiler-free, but it's important to read this book with more appropriate expectations than what was set up by the publisher. You won't get all of your burning questions answered. Probably not any of them.As for its positive attributes, the few sections narrated by Aunt Lydia are truly spectacular. Aunt Lydia has always been a captivating villain and pulling back the curtain on her thoughts is endlessly intriguing. Listeners of the audiobook are in for an additional treat, since they brought in Ann Dowd from the show to reprise her role for the reading.Again, all in all, this is a decent yarn. It's not going to be a classic, but it's an okay pop novel. I knew pretty much from the first chapter that it wasn't going to deliver everything I desired for a sequel and by a quarter of the way in it was pretty clear what the ending surprise would be, but it still moved at a good pace and kept me moderately in suspense. For Handmaid\u2019s Tale fans, as long as you lower your expectations there's no reason why you can't find enjoyment in these further adventures of Gilead.", "\"How tedious is a tyranny in the throes of enactment. It's always the same plot.\" So why does Margaret Atwood choose to tell the story again? That question has haunted me since I heard the announcement of the project almost a year ago. WHY? I was convinced I would hate the hype and the gushing reviews and the book itself, and started reading with the attitude of someone who knew the story didn't need telling again.To my surprise, I liked it from the start, and soon engaged in the thriller unfolding with a rare reading joy, still wondering why Atwood wasted her precious time on a sequel like this. Not much new was added to the dystopian plot of Gilead, I thought. But then a shift occurred in my mind.I always saw The Handmaid's Tale as a warning of the slow normalisation of religious fanaticism and of the strengthening of patriarchal structures in our modern era, and the story itself as a mirror of our all too human tendencies to adjust to the most absurd situations if we are caught off-guard and left confused.The Testaments has a different purpose, and it comes as a challenge in the era of #MeToo. Don't accept the unacceptable. Act on injustice. Speak up. Do what has to be done to make the world safer for women and children. Say no to the objectification of your body. No tyranny will last forever if you are brave enough to do your individual bit.Whenever Aunt Lydia's badly executed statue was mentioned, I had this strange feeling that it was some kind of Atwoodian insider joke, but I could not put my finger on the reference. In the end I gave up trying to figure out what she meant, as I found my own truth. And I had to wait until the very end: the last page made me laugh out loud. Another scientific conference on Gileadean Studies, another reflection on the difficulty to find truth in details. Truth is in the symbol though, and that noseless, broken statue of Aunt Lydia that was found after the breakdown of Gilead spoke of the ephemeral immortality (deliberately oxymoronic from the start) that Ozimandias fell victim to in Shelley's famous sonnet. I will close with him, as he speaks of the timelessness of power(lessness) and (im)mutability:\"I met a traveller from an antique land,Who said\u2014\u201cTwo vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;And on the pedestal, these words appear:My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\u201dNothing beside remains to be said. I leave my earlier testimonies as a tribute to the process of discovering the truth of the storyteller in each (his)story:My predictions will face reality(or fiction?)-check now! I can't believe I am actually holding a brandnew copy of The Testaments in my hands... we are writing the date of 9/11 Anno Domini 2019.Let the journey begin!Thoughts on hearing it was coming in 2018:Based on the scary prophetic power of some of Margaret Atwood's other dystopian social studies, I am not sure I can even stomach the idea of what will happen to Offred next. May I suggest a feel-good start, changing her name into Nofred?No, that's not going to happen. I think the world is currently growing into Margaret Atwood's new novel, demonstrating the insanity a bit more each day. Getting very, very impatient by now. If I were to embrace a religion (No!), it would have to be the religion of literature, and I would praise the special god in Atwood's MaddAddam every day by now: \"Oh Fuck\", as Snowman-the-Jimmy said only when it was really, really bad (which was quite often).", " \"But I had a third eye, in the middle of my forehead. I could feel it: it was cold, like a stone. It did not weep: it saw. And behind it someone was thinking: 'I will get you back for this. I don't care how long it takes or how much shit I have to eat in the meantime, but I will do it.\" I wasn't sure at first how well a sequel written so long after book 1 would go down. I loved The Handmaid's Tale and I couldn't think how the story could have continued.However, this sequel was fantastic! There are three POVs. Agnes Gemina, brought up in a commander's household in Gilead; the infamous Aunt Lydia and her villainous ways and finally Daisy, living in Canada with her parents - but with a secret identity.The Testaments gives a different outlook on Gilead, we see things from the Aunt's perspective, we see part of the founding of Gilead and it's construction.I loved the ending. It was absolutely what I wanted from it, couldn't have asked for anything else.4 stars!", "3.4/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u201cYou don\u2019t believe the sky is falling until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201dI'm very conflicted. I don't know if this book tricked me into liking it or if I actually do or don't. Because when I think about the characters and the plot a little more, I find problems. I'm very confused though. This was a very anticipated and surprising book for many of us. We all know it happened because of the tv show but luckily they concealed it by developing a completely different plot with different characters that connected somehow to the original ones. Yes, because they could doesn't mean they should... but it was a story that indeed could be told. But it ruined the mystery that first book left in us you know? There is a trend in media these days with patronizing the fans and explaining to us through exposition every single thing like we're imbeciles. I love media which keeps all the mystery and lure you in without making everything blatantly obvious. This book explained too many things.First of all, there are three different perspectives we see the world through here. \"Baby Nicole\", the Famous Aunt Lydia and a random but not so much at the end daughter of a commander, Agnes. Aunt Lydia's side was the most engaging and interesting to me. Yes, I have watched the show, yes, I fucking hate that bitch, but we see a different side of her here that I didn't anticipate. I will definitely be seeing her with a different light once the show is back on. I found Nicole and Agnes to have the same voice and were kind of annoying sometimes. At first, I needed like half a page to understand which POV I was reading from. Especially with scenes when they ware together. I feel like Nicole gained more character when she went to Gilead, but this was just because she was different than all of them. Yes, I enjoyed the swears. Duh. But I wanted something more character wise? I didn't feel as whole as with June/Offred. She was such an engaging character. Maybe this happened because we had many POVs to read from? I can't say.The plot felt somewhat... basic and expected? The book was definitely bigger than it should be. Too much exposition man. It wasn't boring at all for me... but I think the length could be lowered. I don't know what to tell you, people. I'm still very puzzled. Read this book, of course, but don't have the expectation that you'll like it as much as the first one. But I gotta admit, this book gave me a big thirst for the show now. I can't wait for it to be back, honestly. Even though there we are in a completely different path. I want to see if anything will stay the same once we get more seasons and when it ends. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!", "\nI liked this one more than A Handmaid's Tale! Call me crazy! But I loved that there was this exciting plot that was pushing the momentum forwards and that we were learning more about Gilead and the world outside and the way it came to be. I read this DIRECTLY after A Handmaid's Tale, like I read both of them in the span of a few days, and I felt this enriched the world so much more.\n", "i know ive said this before, but just because an author can write a novel, does that really mean they should? i thought \u2018the handmaids tale\u2019 was strong enough on its own. yes, i had questions afterwards, but i like that the story is a reflection on real society, where we dont have all the answers. and even though i did enjoy this solely from an entertainment perspective, i just dont find it necessary. i think atwood got caught up in all the success of the television adaptation and thought she could capitalise on writing a sequel. which i cant blame her for one bit - i would probably do the same. but again, this feels like a story that was forced to be written, not one that came organically or from inspiration. its not even told similarly to the first book. while this sequel also (rightly) calls out todays society for the oppression of women, it feels like the narrative is telling me what to think, where \u2018the handmaids tale\u2019 forced me to come to my own conclusions. i dunno. its just a major stylistic/writing change (downgrade, even) that didnt make the story any better, in my opinion. i do think those who find the world of gilead morbidly fascinating will enjoy this sequel and the new characters but, for me, im just left with the question of \u2018why?\u2019 which i unfortunately couldnt seem to get past.\u21a0 2.5 stars", "3.5 to 4 starsI was going to go with 3 stars because while I liked it, it did not impress me as much as the first book. But, after discussing the book with my wife at dinner last night, I realized I got more from it than I thought, so I am upping my rating a bit.In the afterword, Atwood hints at the fact that this was written in response to the recently renewed popularity of the first book and the current state of affairs in America. Because of this, it does kind of read like it was written to appease the fans instead of an original sequel that she came up with all on her own. I am not saying this as a good or bad thing, it\u2019s just how it felt to me \u2013 some people really like this sort of thing, so it may be perfect for you.I really enjoyed the first half to two-thirds of the book. At first, I was not sure how much I would remember about the first book since it has been about three years since I read it. Also, I have not been watching the TV show. But, the book did a pretty good job getting me back into the story and I thought the story and character development were both very good.However . . . with only about 25% of the book left, for me it got kind of \u201cHollywood\u201d \u2013 a bit cheesy and unbelievable. Suddenly the characters were making odd choices that felt like they served no purpose other that to move the book quickly to a resolution. To have such a rushed and far-fetched resolution to such a richly developed story/dystopian world felt kind of weird. This is where the book lost points for me.I think that fans of the book and TV show should give this one a try and likely enjoy it. However, be prepared to find it a bit lacking compared to the first book.", "\n\u201cOne mysterious box, when opened, so often conceals another.\u201d \nIn relation to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Hulu series, I found The Testaments entertaining. As a follow up to the novel, I found it lacking. I am holding off on a complete review until I have finished rereading The Handmaid's Tale. More to come!", "Winner of the Booker Prize 2019 (together with Girl, Woman, Other)This is a flashy, placative, but also intelligent thriller, here to make some points about society and to entertain - it's certainly not the most layered or subtle literature ever written, but you know what? It's engaging, rather suspenseful and great fun to read, full of quips and commentary on the world we live in, and sometimes, that's more than enough. And honestly: The Handmaid's Tale wasn't particularly ambiguous or enigmatic either. As we already know from the book's predecessor, the theocratic terror regime of Gilead did fall - the book ended with a historic symposium on the failed state. \"The Testaments\" now tells us how this downfall came about, and we hear the story from the alternating perspectives of three women: The infamous and powerful Aunt Lydia from #1, who is one of the women who helped develop the misogynist rules and rites of Gileadean society; a teenage girl who grows up in Gilead and is supposed to submit to her role as a women without any rights; and another young girl who lives in Canada (which borders to Gilead) and discovers her family's connection to Mayday, the resistance group that aims to save women and bring down the vicious regime. In case you are now wondering what happened to Offred, the handmaid at the center of #1, let me tell you that all of the characters are somehow connected to her - beware, readers, it does not make much sense to start \"The Testaments\" before reading The Handmaid's Tale first. Atwood does a great job addressing all kinds of current issues within the narrative: Not only the misogyny of the current US President is lurking between the lines, there are also parts that refer to ISIS, the refugee crisis at state borders and in the Mediterranean, xenophobia and the lack of empathy and solidarity. Another important topic is that of opportunism: We learn how Aunt Lydia became an instrumental part in a machine that systemtically exploits and violates women, and as we all know, it's the mass of enablers who keep such machines running, not those at the very top. Just like in #1, the threat of fascism is at the core of the whole story: When inventing Gilead, Atwood was inspired by the diaries of Joseph Goebbels, and the appearence of the women in the book was influenced by the aesthetics of Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will\". And yes, Atwood paints with very broad brush strokes: This book is highly accessible, and readers aren't required to do much work themselves. I also suppose that the enormous marketing campaign put some people off and, in the eyes of quite a few readers, compromised the novel as a work of \"serious\" literature. I have to say that I don't really mind though: If \"serious\" movies with world-class actors can have major premiere events with red carpets, fancy dresses, press frenzy and all, why shouldn't a world-class writer like Margaret Atwood live it up at Waterstones London with her gang of Jeanette Winterson and freakin' Neil Gaiman as well as people dressed as handmaids and Pearl Girls while the whole literary world watches? More power to you, Ms Atwood! So if you expect intricately crafted, subtly plotted, lyrically written prose, or a completely new twist on the whole Gilead saga, this novel will probably disappoint you. But if you want to read a straightfoward, intelligent, well-paced, witty thriller spiced with social commentary in which women take down the patriarchy, this is the book for you. This text has the potential to reach many readers who normally wouldn't pick up a book on feminism, and it will allow people to join the conversation.", "Why? Why did Atwood write this more than thirty years after The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (see my review HERE), when she\u2019d already written sequels to that for the TV series? Because \u201cwe started moving towards Gilead instead of away from it \u2013 particularly in the United States\u201d and more specifically, to answer \u201cHow did Gilead fall?\u201d and \u201cHow do you get to be such a person [as Aunt Lydia]?\u201d.Why read it? Hype, a heavy discount, and morbid curiosity. It\u2019s an easy read and enough of a page-turner to finish quickly. It answers plenty of questions - and raises more. No spoilers below. But, it\u2019s a weird hybrid. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019d planned adult and YA versions, then wove them into a single plait. The Decline and Fall\u2026? \u201cPer ardua cum estrus\u201dThe plot is predictable, the writing is full of clich\u00e9s (excusable for Biblical homilies and Gilead sayings), and the more delicately variegated symbolism of Handmaid (especially red and tulips) degrades to more heavy handed mentions of flowers (usually blue ones - the colour for wives). Image: Tulips and forget-me-nots (Source.)Overall, it felt lazy, yet I eagerly read it to the end. It\u2019s better than the unnecessary MaddAddam (see my review HERE) and the execrable The Heart Goes Last (see my review HERE). Old and Wise or Young and Annoying?There are three narrators, in short alternating chapters, mostly concerning events around 15 years after the end of Handmaid. It was obvious how and when the threads would cross and eventually join. The \u201cArdua Hall Holograph\u201d was secretly written by Aunt Lydia, as events unfolded, though with relevant backstory about her life before Gilead. The TV series had already presented a more rounded, complex, and sympathetic view of her than the original novel, and this expands on that. It\u2019s 4*. \u201cHe owes me, but that could prove a liability. Some people do not enjoy being indebted.\u201dAunt Lydia is strong, shrewd, knowledgeable, and ruthless. She\u2019s the chief Aunt, but no one expects a woman to do all that she does or know all that she knows; her increasing power goes unnoticed. She knows the value of information; she plots, and bides her time. I was reminded of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies (which I confess I saw on TV, rather than read).The other sections are \u201cTranscripts of Witness Testimony\u201d by two different women, describing their teen years, apparently written years after the events described. Agnes, the wide-eyed innocent child of a commander in Gilead, and Daisy, a bit of a know-it-all, living free in Canada.After a dramatic event, the change in Daisy\u2019s character and voice is disproportionate. She becomes an insufferable teen, complete with irrelevant crush. Her adult self alters tone accordingly. As the end of the story approaches, the mood and intended audience feels increasingly like The Hunger Games (see my review HERE) and its ilk. Not my thing, so I rate these narrations 2*.Contemporary Shadows?All three women have at least two very different roles and identities during their lives. The different names are not confusing, but the switching is sometimes inconsistent and thus distracting. All three find risky ways to resist the patriarchy and to stand up for women. This is written in the light (dark?) of #MeToo as much and the resurgence of religious-backed populist demagogues. Atwood is clearly on the side of women, and against authoritarian regimes, but I expect her readers already are. Unlike Handmaid, she doesn\u2019t have anything very new to say, despite increased emphasis on bloodlines and whether the \u201creal\u201d mother is the one who gave birth or the one who raised and loved the child. Humour?For reasons I cannot fathom, Peter Kemp classed this as comedy in his review for The Times. There was a puerile pun (the Aunts say \"Pen Is Envy\", because other women can\u2019t read or write), but other than that\u2026? Rapid Reading?I read this quickly for a book of more than 400 pages. More impressively, supplicant aunts, totally illiterate when they arrive in their mid teens, are fluent readers of adult books in less than six months, with a basic knowledge of geography too, even though most of each day is filled with arduous chores. As a former primary school teacher, I\u2019d love to know how! (All we\u2019re told is that they start off with Dick and Jane books, whose illustrations had the clothes made more modest.)Meanwhile, Aunt Lydia\u2019s favourite books are not quick reads: Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina, Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Paradise Lost, and Lives of Girls and Women. Quite a tribute to Alice Munro from her compatriot!Unreliable?\"History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.\" Like Handmaid, this ends with a Symposium of Gileadean Studies in the far future, discussing the newly-found testimonies (cassette tapes in Handmaid, documents here). It\u2019s the first time we hear directly from a man. He questions the authenticity and accuracy - as men often do with women\u2019s testimonies. But it\u2019s important in an academic context, dealing with a regime that ruled with fear and relentless propaganda, and where few women were able to write. Aunt Lydia had plenty of reasons justify her role in the regime, so her embroidery may not be of the petit-point variety that future wives were taught. But Atwood didn\u2019t leave enough doubt to make it worth raising the question. Image: Petit-point embroidered blue flowers (Source.)Redemption?For a book that is firmly against a perverted version of Christianity, redemption is a strong element. \u2022\tAunt Lydia wants to redeem herself in the eyes of possible future readers. \u2022\tOne person demonstrates the greatest love (John 15:13), yet we never hear from them directly. \u2022\tBy the time I finished this review, Atwood had redeemed herself in my eyes.

Great firstly because it proved so prescient - I always felt that Brave New World was a better written book than 1984, but only one is still widely quoted and referred to today - and Handmaid's Tale has I think equalled if not eclipsed 1984. And great also because it has inspired and resonated with so many people.Trump and anti-abortion male legislatures (Atwood remarked that young, fertile women - a minority in any society have across so many civilisations and cultures been a resource that society feels it can shape for its own purpose and without their consent) have been subject to the silent but dramatically effective protest of the Handmaids.Even these last two weeks in the light of the proposed (and now executed) prorogation of the UK parliament a quote from the Handmaid's Tale is going viral:\n\"That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn't even any rioting in the street. People stayed at home at night, watching television\"\nSo to the extent that the publication of the Testaments causes people to revisit the novel - address some of the misconceptions around its message, celebrate Atwood as a writer then I welcome it.But it is the novel itself where I start to pick nits:Atwood has said that she was inspired to write the novel as she wanted to examine how oppressive regimes fall, and perhaps secondarily to explore how people survive in those regimes and even what causes people to resist the regimes.On the second front I think she does succeed. The Aunt Lydia character is an excellent one - inspired heavily by Thomas Cromwell. From the event this evening Atwood is fascinated by the paralles between Gilead and Henry VIIs court and particularly the way in which Thomas Cromwell navigated his way to a position of power while carrying out his own schemings. She is obviously familiar with and a fan of both the Mantel trilogy (well the two published and knows of the one to come - she jokingly stage whispered \"it doesn't end well for him\") and the Diarmaid MacCulloch biography last year (she did not mention the author). On the first though I struggle really to see the insights she brings. Atwood has made a big thing - in both books (and as a pre-condition for the TV serialisation of the Gilead world) that all events must have a basis in real life events. However I am struggling to tie the way in which the Gilead regime to the downfall of various regimes that she references heavily as inspirations for the book. These include USSR (where the Stalinist purges are a key inspiration for this novel), East Germany (more of an inspiration for the first), Pinochet's Chile, the Argentina Junta (the latter two inspiring the stadium scenes in this book and the disappeared babies of Argentina having clear parallels with one of the characters here). In most if not all the cases the actual abuses of the regime I think emerged as a result of (and post) their fall rather than precipitating it.And the resistance part of the novel ends more as a rather simplistic adventure story - I don't really read literary fiction for passages like this\n\u201cGlad you made it,\u201d said Captain Mishimengo. He shook our hands; he had two fingers missing. He was stocky, about sixty, with tanned skin and a short black beard. \u201cNow here\u2019s our story, supposing you\u2019re asked: this is a cod schooner, solar, with fuel backup. Flag of convenience is Lebanon. We\u2019ve delivered a cargo of cod and lemons by special licence, which means the grey market, and now we\u2019re heading back out. You\u2019ll need to stay out of sight during the day: I heard from my contact, via Bert who dropped you at the dock, that they\u2019re bound to be looking for you soon. There\u2019s a place for you to sleep, in the hold. If there\u2019s an inspection, coast guard, it won\u2019t be thorough, it\u2019s guys we know.\u201d He rubbed his fingers together, which I knew meant money.\nI also felt that rather than illuminating how things in Gilead worked, the book at times struggled to maintain a coherent and consistent world view (for example I was not entirely convinced how the extreme punitive emphasis on the sanctity of the handmaids tied with the dentists ability to abuse children; the food shortages did not always seem prevalent; the continuing use of \"MayDay\" as a password by an organisation known to everyone as MayDay, and the addition of \"June Moon\" to add more secrecy is just silly) and other than the Pearl Girls I did not gain as much additional understanding of new depths to the societal picture as I had wished.And whereas I liked the Aunt Lydia character - her depth and complexity, the other characters seemed far more one-dimensional. While I think I can excuse this for the Gilead based girl (and I think she does give a sense of how people can rapidly become assimilated to any culture if they have grown up with it); the Canadian girl was much less convincing - the device of having her unable to curb her language, attitude or atheism was significantly over-used and her (lack of) reaction to the murder of the people she thought were her parents for the first 16 years of her life was simply implausible. The book ends - like Handmaid's Tale - with a 22nd Century Symposium looking back at the events of Gilead and using source materials (which are effectively the book we have been reading). This is one area where The Testaments is better constructed than its predecessor - we are given more convincing explanations of the provenance of the documents that make the novel and even a clever hint by Atwood (via a link with Mary Queen of Scots and the Casket Letters) that the Aunt Lydia piece may even be a fake - Atwood left a rather hanging comment in the launch event that she is \"fascinated by forgeries\". The character links between this book and its predecessor (taken for granted in pretty well every review - not least due to the influence of the TV series) are instead described as \"not definitively excluded .... jumping to conclusions .... [for] future scholars to examine\" We are also told that the Professor and his assistant prepared a \"facsimile edition of the three batches of materials, which we have interleaved in an order that made approximate narrative sense to us\" - initially for the symposium attendees but also for the \"benefit of a broader audience\".And here I think is the crux of my dilemma with this novel. The Handmaid's Tale even as a novel had moved well beyond the literary fiction space, and the TV series took it into popular culture. Atwood has I think written a novel which is deliberately broad in its appeal: it cleverly builds on the novel, fan theories and the TV series while adding her own stamp; it is also much more clearly an adventure type book and less literary. But its those very strengths which I think will lessen its appeal to fans of literary fiction.So on the day of its publication I am: more convinced then ever of the greatness of its predecessor; glad I read this book; pleased it has been written; unconvinced of its individual literary merits; of the view that a lifetime achievement Nobel Prize would be a more appropriate recognition for the author than the Booker would be for this book.", "\u201cThe Testaments\u201d opens in Gilead about 15 years after \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but it\u2019s an entirely different novel in form and tone. Inevitably, the details are less shocking \u2014 at least in part because the horrors of Gilead\u2019s male-centered theocracy are already so well known. When Offred first told her \u201csad and mutilated story,\u201d we were hearing about the hangings, the Unbabies and the Sons of Jacob for the first time. But by now, Gildead\u2019s breeding Ceremony is a creepy cultural touchstone.Atwood responds to the challenge of that familiarity by giving us the narrator we least expect: Aunt Lydia. It\u2019s a brilliant strategic move that turns the world of Gilead inside out. In \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Aunt Lydia is the orthodox teacher whose platitudes and instructions cycle through Offred\u2019s mind. But in \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d Aunt Lydia speaks directly to us in all her conflicted complexity. She has become the supreme matriarch of this masculine cult. \u201cI control the women\u2019s side of their enterprise with an iron fist in a leather glove in a woollen mitten,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I keep things orderly: like a harem eunuch.\u201d As a living legend, the very model of moral perfection and feminine wisdom, she enjoys a special position of extraordinary power \u2014 and she knows just how. . . .To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert...", "3.5 stars. It pains me to write this, because I love The Handmaid's Tale, but this book just felt incredibly unnecessary. The plot is predictable, with \u2018revelations\u2019 that are glaringly obvious, and characters that just don\u2019t have the same level of depth of emotion that Offred had. With The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, we have a novel that leaves a lot to the reader\u2019s imagination. The ending is ambiguous and interesting, with a story that features an incredibly narrowed view of a world by a woman so obviously wronged by it, and I felt that all of that is taken away here. Blanks are filled that didn\u2019t need filling in, and it ends up just feeling gratuitous. Unlike The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, this is told through the interweaving lives of three women. One, a girl growing up in Canada with a mysterious link to Gilead, one a girl growing up within the walls of Gilead, and Aunt Lydia - a founder Aunt, and a character we first see from Offred\u2019s perspective in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Aunt Lydia\u2019s is by far the most interesting perspective, as we delve into her past and some of the more dubious choices she makes to become so powerful in a world that favours men. In terms of her story, I enjoyed looking back at the founding of Gilead and the struggles women faced during the initial upheavals, and their transition from powerful professions like lawyers and doctors, to nothing. If anything, I would have liked more of this time period to add some more emotional depth to the future plots. Some of Aunt Lydia\u2019s decisions later on the book also seemed a little out of character however, and I struggled to understand her reasonings behind them, given what she goes through to \u2018get to the top\u2019. I did love her interactions with the other founder Aunts though and the many levels of scheming and backstabbing that goes on amongst them. They made the chapters, and I would have loved if this was explored more. In terms of the other characters, Agnes and Daisy, I struggled to differentiate between the two at times, as their voices are so similar. I also didn\u2019t find their stories particularly engaging and Daisy in particular is extremely irritating at times. The passage of time over the overall plot is also a little disorientating, without any clear idea of how much time passes between chapters. Agnes goes from being a child to early twenties with very little comment. The use of secondary characters in these later chapters is also largely underdeveloped, and used only for plot progression (a very obvious one) that makes future developments feel a little cheap. I know I\u2019ve mainly slated this, but I do love Atwood\u2019s writing style. After a slow start getting in to this, I flew through it in a couple of days - which can be credited to Atwood\u2019s ability to create a world I still find deeply intriguing. I just wish there had been more to add to this story instead of taking away my wonderful experiences of the original novel. Disappointing.", "Here I also keep another set of files, accessible only to a very few; I think of them as the secret histories of Gilead. All that festers is not gold, but it can be made profitable in non-monetary ways: knowledge is power.Aunt LydiaIt was an \u201cextraordinarily complicated process\u201d to get copies of the manuscript, which is protected by a \u201cferocious\u201d non-disclosure agreement.Chair of Booker Judges as told to the GuardianWhen, in 2197, the Thirteenth Symposium on Amazonian Studies takes place, the assembled historians, looking for evidence of the Great Amazon PRH war, will pore over the details of the launch of The Testaments as one of the first skirmishes that signalled the epic conflict to come. With a midnight launch planned by PRH for September 9th 2019, a plan with which the Amazonias had officially concurred, suddenly on September 3rd the Twittersphere was set ablaze by two separate breaches of the agreement.Select Agents of the mysterious Prime organisation had been sent copies of the top-secret document, although the Amazon empire denied any deliberate malpractice and even, although only once it was too late to remedy the situation, issued a, nearly unprecedented, apology via diplomatic channels.Simultaneously media outlets in the free world began to release details of The Testaments, despite a worldwide embargo, the first from the publicly funded NPR, quickly followed by the Washington Post and New York Times, each competing to reveal as many of the secrets as possible. How this information was shared despite a strict worldwide embargo remains unclear, but a microdot may have played a part:\u201cMicrodot?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cAn old technology that has fallen into disuse, but that is still perfectly viable. Documents are photographed with a miniature camera that reduces them to microscopic size. Then they are printed on minute plastic dots, which can be applied to almost any surface and read by the recipient with a custom viewer small enough to be concealed in, for instance, a pen.\u201d \u201cAstonishing,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cNot for nothing do we at Ardua Hall say \u2018Pen Is Envy.\u2019\u201dIt was a fascinating saga, which is unfortunately rather more than (that one good joke aside) I can say for the book itself. Atwood was once an author whose books I eagerly awaited but this, after Hag Seed and The Heart That Goes Last, is the third major disappointment of recent years.Ultimately Atwood appears to be trying to please too many audiences at once: those who have been waiting 35 years for a sequel to the Handmaid's Tale, and forming their own theories in the meantime: fans of the TV series (who feel the primary target); and prize judges swayed by ferocious NDAs. Indeed there are some quite clever nods to each group that will pass others by. But the net effect is to leave this literary fiction fan distinctly underwhelmed. The end result has cardboard characters (a cliched teenager who seems completely unphased by the death of her parents in a terrorist attack, rapidly followed by being told they weren't her real parents), a hokey plot (as pointed out by Gumble's Yard, the infamous resistance organisation Mayday has as its password ... Mayday?!) and a tedious drip..drip..drip of revelations that are obvious to the reader well beforehand (to be fair not helped by the fact that all the early embargo breaking press reviews competed to reveal as much of the plot as possible).1.5 stars rounded up to 2 for the fun of the botched launch.", "Co-winner of the Booker prize 2019Brilliant! Absolutely phenomenal!What a fantastic ride coming back to the world of Gilead 15 years later. The sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is written very different from Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian classic, but in no way does it suffer as a follow-up. The Testaments is superbly narrated by three women- two young women with one who escaped to Canada as a child, the other raised in Gilead, and, last but not least, the very powerful and dangerous, Aunt Lydia. I am thankful to have listened to the audiobook as the voice of Aunt Lydia is narrated by the formidable actress Ann Dowd who plays said character in the amazing Hulu series. If you wish to learn about the secrets of Gilead and how Aunt Lydia got to where she was, do read this book. It is exceptionally suspenseful and entertaining and meshes well with the Hulu series.The Testaments gave me the shivers many times while listening...so frightening at times...5 out of 5 Booker worthy stars", "I've had less than good experiences in my last few Atwood reads - first I spent money on the novella series that was then removed from my Kindle with no renumeration. Then I held off and finally read The Heart Goes Last and ended up sorely disappointed in it. You can read my 2-star review but part of my complaint had to do with a feeling of author laziness on some level. Claiming it was an all new book, but to me half of it being very familiar since I'd already read it in the novella version. And paid for it twice.I've reread The Handmaid's Tale in the last few years, and it holds up. The MaddAddam trilogy has a fond place in my heart. I don't believe I should have to watch a TV series to appreciate a book, and this forms the major part of my criticism of this book. I did watch the first season of The Handmaid's Tale, but the episodes came slower and slower, because I was having nightmares. I delayed watching the second season because real life seemed dark enough, and my husband finally went ahead and watched it without me.When I got to the end of this book, I went and read the synopses of seasons 2 and 3 of the show and here's the thing - this book intertwines with the show and you simply will not understand it without all the parts. This is more aggravating than I can express. My second major complaint is a complex frustration of this book being included in the Man Booker Shortlist. It is a good enough book in the sense that there are three narrators that rotate and tell different pieces of a somewhat exciting story, but as others have pointed out since two of the narrators are teenagers the novel reads like a pretty typical dystopian YA novel. And maybe not the best one I've ever read (The Hunger Games, for instance, has far more complexity, higher stakes, and dynamic characters.) The writing serves for the pace of a thriller-dystopia but there is nothing literary about it. Even Justin Cronin's vampire novels are of a more literary nature than this book, and I feel like the Man Booker judges are decades, maybe centuries, away from considering such a novel on their list. It does not deserve the spot it is occupying; there were books far better in writing and creativity and voice that were excluded for what, a nostalgia spot?This is not the bitter accusations of someone who is whining because she didn't get a review copy. I don't always, I'm not important enough, so I hadn't even tried. I was happy to purchase it the day it came out in Audible and listen to it in all my spare time to finish it by last night. I also feel the book leaves several questions unanswered but as a reader, I don't even know if I should remark on them or assume they are explained in the show, to the extent that Margaret Atwood felt she didn't need to. For now I'll let them be.", "UPDATE OCTOBER 2019 The Coode Street Podcast goes into the SFnal roots of this title.My hold came in today!! The librarians saw my name on the holds list and our library bought one, instead of relying on the system's many multiple copies. That way I got my hold immediately instead of being wherever I was, deep in the triple digits.They like me. They really like me.***All three stars are for Aunt Lydia's sections. Agnes is annoying, a lump of nothing as required by her upbringing; it didn't make her any fun at all to read about. Daisy is intolerable, both for her backstory and her impossibly selflessly perfect nature; we're unsurprised at her actions because she is The Chosen One.Try this: Only read Aunt Lydia's sections, flipping quickly past the character-as-mouthpiece young women. You'll get an interesting sidebar to the amazing [The Handmaid's Tale]. Aunt Lydia's story is, in fact, better than the original book.I'll only get yelled at if I say more so that's it.", "In The Testaments, Margaret Atwood brings a thrilling conclusion to the story she started with The Handmaid's Tale about the dystopian Gilead. It does not contradict the previous novel and is not inconsistent with the television series starting the amazing Elisabeth Moss. One of the key differences between this book and its predecessor is that rather than being narrated by June/Offred, this book has multiple narratives: Aunt Lydia (the same one from before), Agnes (a Commander's daughter inside Gilead), and Daisy (a slightly older girl in Toronto). I enjoyed seeing the story from Aunt Lydia's point of view as well as the intertwined stories of the other two girls. There is a lot of suspense here, perhaps less innovation though since we are already familiar with Gilead and its eccentricities from The Handmaid's Tale, but I think that Atwood did a nice job filling in some blanks and in bringing us some closure with some of our favorite characters. In order to avoid spoilers, I will just say that I found this book very satisfying and deserving of the Man Booker Prize which it won in 2019.", "At the opening of The Testaments, a statue is unveiled. This is a statue of the infamous, puppet-master, Aunt Lydia. Readers of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will know her well. The Testaments is narrated by three narrators, but Aunt Lydia is the dominant of the three. Through her secretive writings, we learn of her history, and how she rose to power to become the mastermind that sets in motion the destruction of Gilead. Again readers of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will recognise the diary style of writing that is employed by Aunt Lydia as she records her actions and deeds, hopefully to be found by historians in the future.Aunt Lydia is such a wonderful character and the irony in which a woman, albeit the most powerful of the Aunts, but still a woman, seen by the men of the Republic of Gilead as second class citizens, barely more than vessels for carrying babies, brings the Republic crashing down around their heads.Aunt Lydia may be the dominant narrator, but the other two have vital roles to play in the narrative as well. Their chapters are labelled as \u201cWitness Testimony 369A\u201d and \u201cWitness Testimony 369B\u201d respectively. Both narrators give the reader valuable insight to Gilead and how young impressionable minds are easily directed and nurtured into the beliefs of a theocracy. One comes from outside Gilead and provides a contrasting view to the other who was raised in Gilead. Atwood skilfully shifts perspective back and forth with these characters at just the right moments and it works a treat. It is interesting towards the end of the book when the young girl raised in Gilead does not even know how big Gilead is, its geographical location, which countries surround it and share borders. This is what happens when a theocracy is in power and the women, apart from the Aunts, are not even allowed to read. Information, and intelligence, as Aunt Lydia proves so succinctly are a powerful weapon.This book was always going to face intense scrutiny being the sequel to such a classic book and the length of years it has taken Atwood to answer her fan\u2019s pleas. The Testaments has a very different feel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but for me at least, it loses nothing in comparison. After reading some negative reviews, I went back and read this a second time because I was enjoying it so much. I think that most readers will agree that this novel will not be considered the classic that The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is, but for sheer enjoyment, it holds its head high. To be able to find out the history of Aunt Lydia, and to watch her plan and scheme the destruction of Gilead was worth reading the book for me.There is a tenuous link found at the end of the book to Offred, that will tantalise fans of the first book.Just like any sequel trying to live up to impossible hype, this book is going to have its critics, but if you are a fan of the world of Gilead, I urge you to give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.A well deserved 4 Stars!", "\ni'm not saying i would, but if i wanted to steal this book, i know how i'd do it...\n", "Joint Winner of the Booker Prize 2019I can't help but be a little disappointed with this book. In my view The Handmaid's Tale didn't need a sequel, but I suppose we can't begrudge Atwood the opportunity to cash in on the popularity of the TV version. In my view this book is not worthy of a Booker shortlisting, and is possibly the weakest of the Atwood novels I have read.There are two main problems - firstly by alternating the accounts of three narrators, the distinctive voices are lost, and secondly the final part of the book lacks subtlety, and its plotting defies credibility. The book does not really stand alone - too much knowledge of the original is assumed for that. Another problem is that the three narrations interleave a little too neatly.I did quite enjoy the first half - Aunt Lydia as a subversive plotting the downfall of Gilead is a neat twist, I liked the contrast between life in Gilead and life in neighbouring Canada, and the perspectives added by the two younger narrators were interesting, as was Lydia's account of how she came to work for the Gilead regime.I could have written a more detailed review, but I would rather leave that to those who enjoyed it more.", "[3.5 stars] So I'm finally getting around to reviewing this. I finished it about 2 weeks ago, and didn't really mean to wait that long to write a proper review of it\u2014but I'm glad I did. As I've sat with this book after finishing it, I think my initial feelings have faded a tiny bit. I will say first and foremost, reading this was incredibly enjoyable. It affirmed my love of Atwood's writing, at a sentence level, and storytelling. Her ability to weave plots and deliver complex themes in a very accessible but elevated way is quite a feat. I'm impressed that she can balance a propelling, engaging story with complicated characters all wrapped in beautiful prose.That being said, I think this one is really hard for me to rate/review because I am such a fan of the show, and this is sort of auxiliary material if you watch the show. BUT, you do NOT have to watch the show to read this book. If you've only read  The Handmaid's Tale but never seen the show, you can absolutely read this. There will just be some little easter eggs you will miss or reveals you won't see coming, but watching the show is NOT required to read this by any means. Unlike the first Handmaid's novel, however, I found this one to be a bit tidy. It's a lot more crafty and, maybe, because it has the show to play off of, feels almost restricted by what it can and cannot do. After thinking about it for a couple of weeks, I've had less to stew on than when I originally read The Handmaid's Tale. This one definitely seems to tie things up a bit more neatly and may serve as a coda for whenever the show is finally finished. But at this point, who knows what the show will choose to do with the information here. It doesn't really matter.I'd still recommend this one for fans of the first book, and especially for viewers of the show, but it might not have the staying power that book #1 had for me. Nevertheless, Atwood is a skilled storyteller and writer who will keep you turning the pages.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t believe the sky is falling until a chunk of it falls on you.\u201dIn the highly anticipated sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Margaret Atwood answers some of the questions that have tantalised readers for decades.I\u2019m not gonna lie... I could read about Gilead until the cows come home. I find this dystopian world absolutely fascinating - and equally terrifying, given our current climate. Combine this with Atwood\u2019s sharp, insightful commentary and her stunning prose, and you have all the necessary ingredients for an amazing book!However, I do feel like it pales in comparison to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. It\u2019s perhaps unfair to compare it to a book that has become so revered and well-loved, but I couldn\u2019t help doing that as I was reading along. There are three narratives in The Testaments, and as many of the reviews I read agreed with, one of the narratives is just not as enjoyable as the other two. I can do without an annoyingly whiny teen, thank you very much. Aunt Lydia\u2019s narrative was certainly the highlight of the book for me! I\u2019d have been more than happy if the entire book was from her perspective.That being said, it did feel a tad predictable at times... and some parts felt spoon-fed. A lot of the ambiguity that worked so well in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was missing here.I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments about how this novel was simply unnecessary and I can totally understand that viewpoint. I just really enjoyed being back in Gilead and I can\u2019t deny that I found this to be a real page-turner! I had a good time!

This one really fell flat for me.The idea of self-improvement is often an appealing one, but it takes so much work, so when someone offers us a quick solution, how can we not jump on it?That's what is bringing nine people to Tranquillum House, an exclusive health resort in a remote part of Australia. They're coming to lose weight, to detox a bit from the alcohol they've become fond of, to get lots of spa treatments and massages, and to get a jump on the problems that have been plaguing them. In 10 days, the resort promises, they'll feel totally changed.Frances Welty, once a best-selling romance author, is one of those coming to Tranquillum House. She knows she needs to lose some weight and come to terms with menopause, the imminent decline of her career, and the hurt and humiliation she feels after a romance has gone awry. She's been nursing a bad back, a cold, and a vicious paper cut, and she hopes the pampering and the light fasting will help solve her problems.Ben and Jessica are a young married couple whose relationship has definitely seen better days. All Ben seems to care about is his fancy new sports car (well, it's a Lamborghini, so can you blame him?) while Jessica has spent tons of money on plastic surgery to make herself look better (at least in her eyes), yet her husband doesn't ever tell her how great she looks. They're hoping some marriage counseling might make the difference.Napoleon, Heather, and Zoe, are a family that certainly looks healthy. But they're carrying around a lot of grief, anger, regret, fear, and guilt related to a tragedy that happened just three years ago. While it might have been a better idea to go on a cruise or some other vacation, they hope that the time to meditate and reflect might help them move past these issues.These people and others expect that their stay won't be all pampering and relaxation, but they're not prepared for all that the health resort is going to throw at them. It's going to take some work to make change happen, but they have no idea just how far the director of the resort is willing to take things. It's going to be more than fasting, yoga, massages, and hikes in the beautiful countryside. In some sense, their very survival may be at stake\u2014certainly their willingness to fight for themselves will be challenged.I had high hopes for \nNine Perfect Strangers\n given how much I enjoyed some of Liane Moriarty's previous books, including \nBig Little Lies\n and \nThe Husband's Secret\n. But this one never took off for me; in fact, the pacing was so slow it felt like I was reading it for 10 days, as long as these characters were planning to be at the health resort! First of all, when a book introduces 11 characters to you and provides in-depth backstories for most of them, that's a lot to wade through. There definitely were some interesting characters to follow with fascinating (and sometimes sad) stories, but I could have done with half of them, because the constant shifting of narration made it difficult to keep any sort of rhythm.But honestly, the whole situation with the director of the resort and her decision to take things in a new direction I found utterly laughable. I was waiting to see just how over-the-top Moriarty would take things, and found some of it really hard to believe. I did like the way she tied things up with some of her characters, but I was really disappointed on the whole.I hate when you've been waiting for an author you like to come out with a new book and it disappoints. The good news for me is, there are still some of Moriarty's earlier books I haven't read, so I look forward to those. And who knows? You may enjoy this one more than I did.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.", "Looks like a luscious fudge truffle, tastes like a chocolate-dipped gherkin.Watch out for the green stuff.I'm a Liane Moriarty fan. But this latest book is a mess. It's being marketed as a psychological thriller, but that's really not accurate since the story has only one major plot twist and very little actual suspense. The book's mission isn't really to surprise: instead, its mission seems to be to preach and nag. Unfortunately, by the end you won't have found out one darned thing you didn't already know. Moriarty\u2019s usual wry, spot-on observations about the dramas of real life are missing from this book. Setting all the action in an isolated (and oddly un-chichi) health spa cuts Moriarty off from showing everyday life and culture, which has been one of her greatest strengths. These characters are stranded, unable to go about their daily business of planning, worrying, drinking coffee, and bonding with other women. (Or worrying about what other women think of them.)There are too many characters, eleven in all. And readers really get to know only two well: fifty-something romance author Frances and twenty-year-old nice-kid Zoe, who become unlikely allies as the spa experience grows weirder and more challenging. The many other characters are painted in broad, overly general strokes, and their stories are only loosely connected. Each of the spa clients has an Important and Topical Issue to fret over: body image issues, menopause, social media addiction, death in the family, starting a family, plastic surgery addiction, the list keeps coming; you get the picture. Perhaps Moriarty had a list with check-off boxes to make sure she represented every demographic group. Issues basically stand in for character development. I kept getting Ms. Guilty Grieving Mother mixed up with Ms. Body Image: both characters had dark hair and very little backstory, and they both moped around a lot. After a few hundred pages of characters sloooowly figuring out their many problems, all of the resolutions for even the major stories are sorted out and summed up in short, abrupt epilogue paragraphs. Hunh? And don\u2019t even get me started on the book's single obligatory romance, which takes place (view spoiler)[entirely in the epilogue between two characters who have no chemistry whatsoever. (hide spoiler)]I\u2019m guessing Moriarty was aiming to show all these strangers gradually thawing and bonding through the spa's team-building activities. And there is some of that. But the novel is really more like Fantasy Island goes to (view spoiler)[hell, (hide spoiler)] and the many unrelated characters' stories are connected very loosely by that hokey Fantasy Island plot device: they're all there at the same time to Change Their Lives. And here is the novel\u2019s biggest problem: the head of the spa is a great big galloping cartoon,  a Russian control freak who improbably (view spoiler)[becomes unhinged in the course of the story and runs amok, spiking the smoothies with LSD and indefinitely imprisoning the clients until their spa experience has reached Maximum Meaningfulness. (The imprisonment is surprisingly dull and goes on for much too long.) (hide spoiler)] Even at the novel\u2019s beginning, this character spouts so many Russian endearments she sounds like a Bond villain, and by extension, a peculiarly dated Cold War-era clich\u00e9. Stereotyping is a problem with other characters as well. The book\u2019s single gay character stops on his way to the spa to buy a case of really good wine and dreams of having a child who's a mini-me. The book\u2019s only minority character is relegated to the thankless role of boss-worshiping flunkey. There is also nonstop gratuitous bashing of women who have body image issues (she really doesn\u2019t need to lose weight! she just thinks she does), women who choose to have plastic surgery, and women who devote time to social media. The brief validation these characters get at the novel\u2019s conclusion in no way compensates for the repeated scolding they weather throughout the rest of the book. Not to mention the fact that these aren\u2019t solely women\u2019s issues.At one point, the book breaks the fourth wall in a trippy, meta way that I actually liked. We get dialogue from Frances\u2019 editor: \u201c!!!!\u201d and \u201cclich\u00e9?\u201d which is just darned cute. But what a long way to travel for a mild joke.Finally, the last word in the novel is devoted to (view spoiler)[trashing book reviewers, (hide spoiler)] a move that comes across as petty and weird, especially coming from a novelist who's basically become critic-proof. I received my copy of the book through a Goodreads giveaway, and I was really excited until I actually read the book. Thanks Macmillan Flatiron and Goodreads, because the book is really pretty to look at.", "Liane Moriarty's latest offering is a hugely enjoyable psychological thriller that is pure fun and entertainment whilst incorporating a look beneath the issues of a wide cast of characters and the moving stories that lie behind the facade of their everyday lives. Set in Australia, Tranquillem House is a health and wellness resort that many clients claim transformed their lives for the better. The latest batch of arrivals are 9 strangers that get considerably more than they bargained for with their 10 day cleansing programme of diet, light exercise, therapy and spa treatments. It is run by the Russian Masha, a ruthlessly ambitious former company executive whose near death experience led to a complete change in her life direction. Masha had a dark and hidden agenda for her latest customers, driven by the best of intentions, supported by her primary staff members, Yao, and Delilah.Twice married Frances Welty is an established writer of romances whose career has gone into freefall with her latest offering being rejected by the publishing industry and whose boyfriend, Paul Drabble, has disappeared. Ben and Jessica are a troubled married couple who appear to be remarkably well off. Napoleon is a schoolteacher, with his wife, Heather, and daughter, Zoe, the entire family weighed down by grief and guilt. Tony is a former star footballer, who has recently lost his beloved dog, Banjo. Carmel has lost her husband to a younger woman, has four children, and has lost her self esteem and confidence. Lars is a well heeled divorce lawyer, who only represents wives in his word of mouth law practice. As the story progresses, the backstories and issues that lie behind each individual comes to be slowly revealed. The narcissistic, remote and humourless Masha has plans for them which she is certain will truly transform their lives and which will presage a glorious and glittering future with her in the limelight, enjoying global acclaim.There is plenty of sly humour and wit in Moriarty's story of madness and mayhem at a health resort, where people with little in common with each other find themselves in circumstances where they form unexpected bonds and undergo unexpected transformations. The characters are well drawn and distinct, beautifully developed, all with such high hopes for their short stay at Tranquillem House, their interactions with each other are a joy to hehold. There are heartbreaking stories behind some of the characters, including Masha, that become apparent by the end. I found it hard to resist Moriarty's magic and succumbed to this fabulous novel with absolutely no regrets. A fantastic read with plenty of suspense and tension that comes highly recommended. Many thanks to Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC.", "I never, ever thought I'd say this about a Liane Moriarty novel but...what a terrible, boring, pointless novel!I really disliked this one. Couldn't wait for it to be over, actually. It was so boring and also claustrophobic at the same time, giving me a sense of desperation for these people to just be set free already. For the life of me I could not understand what the purpose of this book was. It didn't even sound like a Moriarty.I am still a fan of the author and will for sure give her another try when the next novel comes out but this one? Wow, what a waste of my time...", "Seriously, I don't know if I loved this book or absolutely hated it. Half way through I was done with it...but, there is a pull to keep you reading to see what happens to the Idiotic Nine, whom I also loved and hated. There are 10-11 storylines in the book all told sporadically from each of their points of view. It wasn't confusing in the least, but it did get rather boring, especially for the characters that I didn't like. Even the epilogue went on....and on.....and on. Perhaps if it had been more selectively edited I would have enjoyed it more but, as it was, it is a book I will forget by next week. I expect better and more from Moriarty. Sadly.", "Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty is a 2018 Flatiron publication. Frances- former bestselling romance author- ironically the victim of a romance con/scamLars- divorce attorney representing women onlyTony- former professional sports starNapoleon, Heather, and Zoe- family coming apart at the seamsCaramel- Husband dumped her for a younger woman- wants to lose weight \u2013 gain positive self -image Ben and Jessica \u2013 marriage on the rocks after winning the lotteryMasha- Head guru- health spa ownerNine people, all from very different walks of life, arrive at Tranquillum House, a highly recommended health resort. Each of them is coping with various life issues, from simple domestic uncertainties, or huge family problems, to marital woes, and weight loss goals. After the prologue, the first character the reader is introduced to is Frances. This was a great opener for the avid reader who will \u2018get\u2019 the subtle and not so subtle digs at the publishing industry and the trends they run right into the ground until they become a parody of themselves, forcing authors to either hop on board the train or wait for their chosen genre to become popular again. So, right away, I knew I was going have to see how Frances fared, and was all in. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what other sardonic observations the author had up her sleeve. But, I must warn you. This book is not like Moriarty\u2019s previous novels, which usually centered around the family unit, providing a taut element of suspense, blended with humor and sarcasm. This novel has the humor, sarcasm and the suspense, but the setting is not at all domestic, as you will see. I usually dislike novels with a large cast of characters. I get confused easily trying to keep up with so many backstories and the plot is usually way too busy. However, this book is an exception. I had no trouble keeping up the characters and the plot is straightforward, so despite the number of characters, the story has a nice, even flow. The only drawback might be that it loses some of the intimacy of Moriarty\u2019s previous works.I loved all the characters. They are a zany group of people, flawed of course, some dealing with deeper issues than others, but all of them are so human and real. I rooted for and cared for them all, but Frances remained a favorite character for me from start to finish. Heather, Zoe, and Napoleon have the meatiest story in the book and evoke some serious emotions. Overall, this one is a bit of a departure for Liane Moriarty, but her signature style is etched all through the novel. While the plot is just this side of deranged, the story is a compulsive read, perhaps a little overlong, but otherwise compelling and highly engrossing!! (view spoiler)[(Oh, and Frances- you could write a psychological thriller if you wanted- but I\u2019m glad you chose my favorite genre instead!) (hide spoiler)]", "Wildly entertaining, wickedly perceptive & an irresistible page-turner!\u201cIt\u2019s just a story!\u201d ......and oh boy what a story it was! NINE PERFECT STRANGERS by LIANE MORIARTY was such a fantastic, lighthearted, fun, sad, and touching story that was so thought-provoking and yet so humourous to read. I absolutely loved this book and couldn\u2019t get enough of these quirky characters. I adored this book right from the very start and had me laughing out loud numerous times and then at other times gasping out loud in shock for the pain that some of these characters were suffering.LIANE MORIARTY delivers quite the fascinating, intriguing, vulnerable, lifelike, and beautifully written read here with quirky and realistic characters, a brazen and dynamic premise and an extremely spellbinding and enthralling storyline. What really stood out about this novel for me was how realistic and raw these characters were written. I could see myself and others in probably every single one of these characters in this story. I thought the inner thoughts and dialogue was absolutely spot on.I absolutely loved the way that this novel made me feel and yup in the end it gave me that warmth and satisfying afterglow that I seek in my books. This was a Traveling Friends Group Read that I read with some Goodreads & Instagram friends. Thanks so much for the wonderful reading experience!!! Norma\u2019s Stats:Cover: Simply beautiful, natural, effective & purely Moriarty! P.S. - Do you see an outline of a woman\u2019s body on the cover?Title: Appealing, suspenseful, intriguing and a fabulous representation to storyline. The nine guests were perfectly imperfect!Writing/Prose: Well-written, engaging, captivating, witty, intelligent and smart.Plot: Intriguing, clever, thought-provoking, suspenseful, perfectly-paced, absorbing, enjoyable and highly entertaining.Ending: Clever and totally satisfying. Loved the progressive timeline. Overall: An extremely enjoyable & entertaining read that had me totally engrossed from start to finish! Would highly recommend!Review can also be found on our Two Sisters Lost in a Coulee Reading book blog:https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/", "\nThis book was a barrel \n\nof fun!\u00a0\n\nI mean really ~ nutty, quirky, and just hilarious.\nI LOVE a good health spa, and the remote Tranquillum House sounded absolutely breathtaking. Nine people sign up for a 10 day visit to achieve a \"cleanse\" and do a bit of recharging. They have absolutely\u00a0\nno idea whats in store for them.\u00a0\nLets just say the rather exotic director, Masha is\u00a0\ndownright creepy\u00a0\nand she might be a bit of control freak. At one point Masha tells her guests, \"This is a health resort, not a prison.\"\u00a0 Hmm...time to worry I'd say!Frances was my FAVORITE guest and she is hilarious. She is also a down and out romance writer. She can't decide if Masha is mad, crazy, nuts and unhinged or perhaps shes a \"genius\" and really odd, alternative, intense, excessively tall and exotic. No one can seem to figure her out!We meet all the guests and their quirks and behind the scenes antics. I was laughing out loud throughout this book and the snarky humor and over the top spa stay was a blast!It was probably a bit too long and could have been shorter, but it had a lot to offer. Mixed reviews had me hesitant, but I'm glad I purchased this one for myself (a treat). Something about a health spa gone wrong was just my perfect read. Read if for a\u00a0\nwild week at the spa!\nI might call this a dark, comic fiction with a hint of thriller. I'm already searching for another Moriarty fix.\u00a0", "A slow starter halfway through and it wasn\u2019t grabbing me then BAM, things started to happen...but seriously how does she do it!? Get into the heads of her characters, like she has a window into the thought patterns of people. It\u2019s uncanny and it\u2019s such a skilled craft! If nothing else I\u2019m obsessed with the way that she uncovers her characters individual foibles and indiosyncracies in the most amusing and hilarious ways poking fun at so many common cliches and stereotypes it\u2019s hard not to snigger along at the characters expense but all light heartedly of course! In all her characters there is always something to relate to even if intially you find nothing in common from the outer. Anyway I have no plans to discuss the plot, read this if your already a big fan of Liane Moriarty\u2019s books, if not then this book won\u2019t change your mind. I can state I don\u2019t care so much for plot when reading her books I just enjoy the journey getting there. It\u2019s always entertaining.", "Nine Perfect Strangers wasn\u2019t the fun, fast read I was hoping for. The characters who check into the Tranquillum Spa are all weighted down with sad baggage. The first half of the novel details their past woes. I kept reading because I found a couple of the characters likable and the central character, Frances, quite endearing. Then there is a pivotal, ludicrous event which is just a vehicle for more unloading of emotional baggage. This book felt unbearably long. I skimmed the last couple hundred pages just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Nope. Nothing.", "UPDATE June 2019: They ARE making this into a TV series (or maybe a movie?)! No date given yet, but Nicole Kidman is cast as the spa director. Hot dog!4.5No snack stashes allowed! (But I\u2019m still rounding up)If I went to a health spa and they confiscated my phone and secretly raided my suitcase for snack stashes, I\u2019d think WTF? What did I sign up for? Those snacks were there for a reason. And the phone, oh dear. As Moriarty writes, \u201c\u201cHow was she going to cope for ten days without instant answers to idle questions?\u201d Sigh, what would any of us do without Google?People arriving at the health spa in Nine Perfect Strangers did not want a WTF moment, I guarantee you. They wanted to relax and they wanted to try something new, but mostly they wanted to improve\u2014lose weight or eat right or feel better. The plot thickens, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about the story; you need to go into this one blind.I was worried about whether my head could hold 9 guests (plus 3 people running the place) without bursting or making me feel senile, but as usual Moriarty pulls it off. Her main trick is to go slowly. She never introduces a person before you have the previous character down pat. She doesn\u2019t jam-pack a party and make you take a name test at the end. It\u2019s like you visit with each person separately so by the time Moriarty has them interacting, you know their scoops. And, per Moriarty style, she makes a bunch of ordinary people seem interesting. Each chapter is about one person, and this style works well.I get pissed that people call Moriarty books chick lit. Maybe it\u2019s because some of the guests are into their appearance, which makes them seem superficial. But we get to see what these characters are thinking and what they really worry about deep down. Every person has baggage and we get to see what\u2019s inside the suitcase.And then there\u2019s the Women and Their Weight hot topic. Although that theme isn\u2019t front and center in this book, it does get some air time, which I think leads people to whisper \u201cchick lit.\u201d Moriarty\u2019s books aren\u2019t epic, complex stories that are massive pieces of art. But Moriarty shows what makes people tick and gives us characters who are introspective. And they are relatable, a big plus. One of her books, What Alice Forgot, was so wonderful that it made my all-time favorites list, and if that means I have chick lit on that precious list, so be it.Add suspense, humor, insight, a good plot, and decent writing, and you have yourself an excellent book. I was thoroughly entertained. And at about the halfway point, I couldn\u2019t put the book down. I didn\u2019t have a clue about what was going to happen. All of the sudden there was a piece of dialogue, actually one sentence, that was delivered brilliantly and made me sit up straight as I entered a whole new scene. And there were surprises every few minutes after that. I will say that many reviewers complain about the second half of the book. It does change genres (again, I\u2019m staying mum so as not to spoil anything), but it was brilliant. There was one scene that was totally over the top, which annoyed me, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me to knock off a star. Here are examples of Moriarty\u2019s funny:\u201cGreat veins,\u201d he said. Nurses often said that about Frances\u2019s veins. She always felt momentarily proud and then kind of depressed, because what a waste of a positive attribute.\u201d\u201cIt was depressing to be treated like a refrigerator.\u201d\u201cShe was a terrible winker; she found it hard to close only one eye and had been told that her attempt looked like an extraordinary facial spasm.\u201d\u201c\u2019Your skin is gorgeous!\u2019 Frances gesticulated wildly, probably because she was trying not to look at Zoe\u2019s pimple.\u201dAnd these sentences will give you an idea of her style:\u201cHe\u2019d thought, full of love and testosterone, that he would protect his woman from bad men and heavy furniture and upsetting food.\u201d\u201cShe couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that if she didn\u2019t record this moment on her phone then it wasn\u2019t really happening.\u201d\u201cWomen and their bodies! The most abusive and toxic of relationships.\u201dMoriarty is heavy on dialogue (which I love) and doesn\u2019t venture out into the wilderness to describe leaves and pebbles (which also gets my stamp of approval). It was only when someone thinks they see a kangaroo on the road that I realized I was in Australia! Kangaroo? I want to see a kangaroo! Must accept that it\u2019s not going to happen here in the states, so sad. Even the word makes me laugh, it\u2019s so playful, jazzy, and rhythmic. Yes, there is a small Complaint Board. You know I didn\u2019t like the one over-the-top scene. But there are three more nits:-A few sentences had faulty grammar. (Where oh where was the editor?) Anyway, they didn\u2019t make me twitch for long. -The book title is wrong, I tell you! The nine people aren\u2019t all strangers: There is a couple and there\u2019s a family of three. The editor in me just hates that the title isn\u2019t accurate. (I need to get a life, lol.)-The book is about 450 pages. Writers, please keep it under 400 pages. I might have adult ADD you know.I loved this novel. One of the reasons I rounded up to 5 stars is because I know I\u2019ll remember the plotline for a long while (memory longevity factors into my rating). I hope they make the book into a movie; I would love to see this on the screen. Hm\u2026I need to think about what to tell the director about casting, lol, once I make my choices. Maybe they will make it into a movie since Big Little Lies transferred to the scene so well. (btw, I can\u2019t wait to see Season 2, coming up in 2019, with queen Meryl Streep!) And of course I want to read the Moriarty books I\u2019ve missed. She\u2019s one of my favorite authors. Check this book out!", "Ahh, this rating breaks my heart. I love Liane Moriarty, but this book was too looney tunes for me. At times I thought I had fallen down a rabbit hole, cracked my head hard, and was hallucinating.To break it down further, I\u2019d rate the characters and the witty observations of life at 4 stars. So I enjoyed chunks of it, and it wasn\u2019t a waste of time. BUT, big but..The plot lost me. Too far fetched and way too ludicrous, I felt like \u201cit\u201d could never have escalated the way it did, without someone calling a halt.

But other times, life changes in an instant with a lightning stroke of good or bad luck with glorious or tragic consequences.\n\nThis book is weird, because it\u2019s sort of a meta-thriller-character-exploration that has no genre and hates genre convention, and what\u2019s perhaps even weirder is that um\u2026 this is Liane Moriarty\u2019s brand now. I find it really interesting how Liane Moriarty\u2019s brand has become thrillers that aren\u2019t about the horror element, and how aware of that she is. With books like her two last, Big Little Lies and Truly Madly Guilty, she's used the thriller conceit to tell stories about the everyday horror that comes with domesticity and being a woman. I felt like she did this perfectly with Big Little Lies, but that the thriller conceit was ridiculous in Truly Madly Guilty. Here, I think she's truly leaned in to her talents for character development. The thing is that what she lacks in actual suspense, she makes up for with interesting characters and some cool messages hidden under a simple story. \n\nShe remembered her first-ever boyfriend of over thirty years ago, who told her he preferred smaller breasts than hers, while his hands were on her breasts, as if she\u2019d find this interesting, as if women\u2019s body parts were dishes on a menu and men were the goddamned diners.This is what she said to that first boyfriend: \u201cSorry.\u201d This was her first boyfriend\u2019s benevolent reply: \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d \n\nFrances is a struggling romance novelist going for a weekend away to try and revamp her life after another bad experience with romance. Napoleon, Heather, and Zoe are a family who seem far more perfect on the outside than they are on the inside. Zoe was arguably my favorite character in the book; compared to several other characters, she is perhaps the most rational. And while Napoleon and Heather aren\u2019t quite as central, each has a lot of development and emotional conflict: there's this moment where they just hold hands and yet it is so amazing. The characters don't end there; Ben and Jessica are a struggling young couple having a conflict over their previous lottery win. Carmel is a young mother dealing with body-image issues after her husband has left her for a younger woman. Lars is a divorce lawyer still attempting to retroactively fix his mother\u2019s situation and in just a bit of conflict with his husband Ray; he was one of my favorite characters. Tony is an ex-football player attempting to change his life up again. Together, they make up the title's nine perfect strangers, all trying to change their lives. And what I enjoyed the most is that all of these characters have their idiosyncrasies, and aren't particularly likable, but all manage to gain your sympathy anyway. Perhaps the novel\u2019s biggest problem is that the thriller aspect is really nothing but a ridiculous framing device, and doesn\u2019t actually cause that much conflict to be brought to life. This is not fixed by the pacing issues \u2014 the beginning of the novel is far too long, and while the payoff for all her setup is fantastic, I thought Moriarty could have streamlined the middle by integrating character development into the plot with far more care. The novel\u2019s tenth and eleventh character, Marsha & Yao, both get good development, but their role in the narrative itself is somewhat overextended at times. I also struggled with the novel\u2019s perspective on reviewers \u2013 a negative reviewer for the main character\u2019s most recent novel is arguably the book\u2019s most personal villain. This aspect is minor and sort of dumb. That being said, the payoff truly is excellent. The book ends its chosen arcs with about eight different quality character endings, including but not limited to an amicable marital breakup that subverts expectations, a sendup of romance novels & commentary on the thriller genre that ends one couple\u2019s story, a very sweet coming-to-jesus moment for one couple, and an excellent and very feminist ending for one woman. Overall, while bits and pieces of this didn\u2019t quite gel, the whole was an enjoyable, entertaining read, and I\u2019m glad I picked it up. \nrelease date:\n 12 November 2018\u2728Arc received from Flatiron for an honest review. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "https://theburgeoningbookshelf.blogsp...I absolutely devoured Big Little Lies! I love how Liane Moriarty starts a story all sweet with likeable characters, then slowly a foreboding veil comes across the story and people\u2019s dark side begins to emerge changing a good story into a compelling story.Nine people book into a health resort, Tranquillum House, ready to be transformed into a better, thinner, healthier version of their former self.A washed up romance novelist, a family broken by tragedy, a has-been football star, a young couple whose marriage is faltering, the wife who has been left for a newer model and the lawyer who has commitment issues. Nine perfect strangers all broken in their own way looking for a make-over, a rejuvenation.Then there is Maria (Masha) Dmitrichenko, a Russian immigrant. Masha, the director of Tranquillum House, is a transformation zealot \u2013 enlightenment for all. These nine guests are to be the first to start her new regime. Their destinies are in her hands. She is going to change these people, not just temporarily, but forever.I wasn\u2019t sure where this story was going to go. But.....the way it went was never in my wildest dreams what I imagined.Moriarty\u2019s ability to bring out the small idiosyncrasies in each person is extraordinary. She slowly dissects each character, their thoughts, fears and hopes are revealed through her writing. It was easy to see something of yourself in these everyday people.Moriarty has written a novel that delves into the human mind and the way we think and connect with each other, showing an intricate observation of human failings and frailties.The story had my emotions reeling. I could feel empathy for the characters and sadness over their different circumstances. But a sudden shift in the story had my anger rising, which shows how real the characters and the story felt to me. With Moriarty you never know what could possibly happen next.Nine Perfect Strangers is a roller coaster of a read with beautifully developed characters full of insecurities, false bravado and completely relatable. Once you start reading this book it will be hard to put down!", "Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of the right book at the right time! This audiobook was just what I was looking for and I spent much of the time listening to it on a beach while often laughing to myself.I really enjoyed Big Little Lies and I wondered how this one would compare. Ms. Moriarty has a way of developing characters that I learned to find a bond with, even though they were all very different. The novel is told from multiple points of view and yet the audiobook flowed seemlessly between the characters.So from the blurb you know that nine people check into a health resort, named Tranquillum House for a variety of reasons. The book started a bit slowly for me as I wondered how the first few introduced characters would fit into the story.Soon we arrive at the health resort which is run with almost military precision. Silence for 5 days, all devices, i.e. phones, tablets, etc. must be turned in. Any banned items found in guests rooms will be confiscated (which included wine, chocolate, snacks, etc) We meet the staff of the \u201cresort\u201d, each guest will have specially prepared menus for them which always included a morning smoothie and then lunches and dinners tailored to their needs.Marsha, the head of Tranquillum an extremely controlling and yet intelligent seeming woman who definitely commands everyone\u2019s attention. She constantly talks to her group of guests, monitoring them often and having individual sessions with them.There are surprises ahead for the guests and readers and they aren\u2019t all about hiking, healthy eating and yoga. Marsha has two other counselors working for her, Yao and Delila, I will leave you to discover all of their backgrounds as I don\u2019t want to spoil this story for anyone.In the end the guests are indeed challenged in many ways, some of which they definitely didn\u2019t consent to or want to be a part of. There is some healing, some transformative times for the guests and then bonding together to try to figure out the answer to a most urgent puzzle.As in Big Little Lies there are important issues behind some of the lighter flow of the book. In this book we touch upon family life, divorce, sibling interaction, infidelity and even suicide. I loved every minute of listening to this audiobook and highly recommend it! Namaste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "3.5 stars, rounded upI am not a consistent Liane Moriarty fan. I\u2019ve loved some, others not so much. So, I had no idea which side I\u2019d come down to on Nine Perfect Strangers. I will say initially it took me a while to wrap my head around all the different characters. I thought the idea of a strict health resort made for an interesting setting. I mean, it made me ponder whether I could handle not just the clean living and digital hiatus, but total silence for 5 days. Moriarty has a dry sense of humor that helped propel the book forward. And some of the points she made rang absolutely true. There was a nice degree of humor vs. poignancy. After its slow start (all that background on the characters), it finally took a turn I didn\u2019t see coming. And while it was never a fast paced book it was a quick and easy read. And overall, enjoyable. Don\u2019t look for this to be your next book club choice, but it\u2019d be perfect for a vacation read. ", "My first Liane Moriarty novel - I was intrigued by this one after the hype surrounding Big Little Lies. This may not be indicative of the quality of her other novels, but I found this to be cliched, predictable and ridiculous. The story focuses on the nine strangers of the title who sign up for a kind of health cleanse at a spa, situated in a remote part of Australia. We quickly learn that something is amiss, and that these people are part of an experience more bizarre and in some ways sinister than was initially advertised.If you're looking for a quick and easy (although very far-fetched) read then this might be the book for you. However I found myself rolling my eyes at multiple points throughout this story - the characters are stereotypes who come across as pretty one-note, and the twists were not unexpected or shocking (for me, anyway). I honestly just found it very hard to care about anything that happened throughout the book.Thank you Netgalley and Penguin UK for the advance copy, which was provided in exchange for an honest review.", "If you like snarky humor, as I do, then you\u2019ll find much to enjoy here. I appreciate an author who can write subtle satire and I loved the wit of the author and the sly digs into self-important authors, the publishing industry, our obsession with age, appearance and \u2018wellness\u2019, and the psycho-babble of some spirituality gurus.\u00a0\u00a0Nine people arrive at the resort, Tranquillion House, for a 10 day stay, looking for R&R and pampering along with transformation. Some are looking for weight loss and a healthier lifestyle while others have serious issues that they need to learn how to cope with in a healthier way. \u00a0Throughout the\u00a0course of the novel we delve deeper into their lives and\u00a0learn their backstories.\u00a0Of course, I had my favorite characters, and Frances, the menopausal romance novelist was the one I was immediately drawn to in this story. I love snarky wit and she was hilarious. But it\u2019s not all laughs, as some guests are dealing with serious issues, many of them heartbreaking.\u00a0It soon becomes obvious that Masha, the spa owner\u2019s \u201cjourney to wellness\u201d is more boot camp than relaxation.\u00a0The first hint is when their bags are searched and contraband is confiscated \u2013 alcohol, candy, snacks, cell phones. What, no google? Frances worries how she will survive not being able to google idle questions that pop into her brain (I confess I would have that\u00a0same moment of panic).\u00a0As the days pass they discover that Masha's methods for transformation are even more radical than they had at first thought.\u00a0\u00a0Halfway through, there was a genre-changing twist\u00a0and things get a little serious. Although I had a suspicion, I was only partially right and the author managed to take me completely by surprise. No spoilers here, but it suddenly became an entirely different story, and the nine must band together for a solution. (I\u2019m being deliberately vague as it\u2019s important to go into this story blind.) \u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s an epilogue, which I ordinarily find to be unnecessary but in this case I appreciated it. There are transformations, although not necessarily the ones the guests expected. \u00a0\u00a0I highly recommend! It\u2019s fun, smart, and well-written. My only complaint is, at 450 pages, it's a bit too long.\u00a0The film rights have already been bought by Nicole Kidman and I think it\u00a0will make a terrific movie.\u00a0\u00a0This was a fun buddy read with my friend Marialyce. We thought it was a fine example of women\u2019s fiction with\u00a0humor and a side of serious, heartfelt issues that often tugged at my heartstrings. Well-done! If taken too seriously this tale may fall short, but if taken as part satire then it's quite amusing.", "I have to say I was disappointed in this one as it didn't really work on any level for me. I wish I was better at giving up on books that aren't holding my interest but I find it so difficult when it's an author whose previous books I have really enjoyed. Nine people arrive at a health spa and each person has their own reason for choosing to stay there. While the spa has plenty of amenities it is also a place that is known to challenge its guests in order for them to get the most out of their visit. Let's just say this isn't going to be a cakewalk for these nine strangers.So a problem fairly soon into the book was I just was not connecting with any of the characters. It's not that I found them unlikable, it's more I just wasn't all that interested in their lives. Not even the romance writer did anything for me. I was bored for the first half of the book and then finally something peaks my interest but it just goes into ridiculous territory so I couldn't even enjoy it. I just don't know what else to say about this one. I think I'm in the minority with how much I didn't like it, but it does seem like most people would agree this is not the author's best book. I'm definitely glad this was a library loan and not a purchase. ", "I have to give this one 5* for pure enjoyment levels. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much at the same time as being made to consider life so much whilst reading a book.A weirdly wonderful group of utter stranger's all rock up to a 10 day wellness retreat, all looking for different answers, all hoping to come out the other side all brand new. Well be careful what you wish for is all I'll say...This group dynamic is pure dynamite as we slowly get to know this motley crew and their inner selves and life influences. Throw into the mix a fanatical health nut and all bets are off. Nine Complete Strangers is wildly entertaining, extraordinarily thought provoking and beautifully written. You'll find your favourite (mine was undoubtedly Francis, a woman after my own heart) and get entirely caught up in their attempts to heal, their growing relationship with each other and the rather unexpected challenges they'll all face together. I won't give too much away but one moment I was snorting tea out of my nose, the next I was shedding a tear - I was all the way in first page to last. Wonderful storytelling. Highly Recommended.", "This one started out strong... (OF COURSE... it's Liane Moriarty), but it didn't stay strong and frankly, could've been better. It was okay. Definitely not her best.This one is written in the way so many are these days, where the narrative switches from one character to another with each short chapter. But in this case, there are NINE characters staying at the health resort, with NINE different narratives, plus another 3 or 4 characters who run the resort, who are also weighing in with their thoughts for the reader.So there's a lot of repetitiveness here, a lot of people talking, and all about the same... exact... events. For me, it felt repetitive, and it really slowed down the pace of the story.Let's just say it's not one of those books that kept me reading late into the night. After about the fourth or fifth person weighed in with their feelings about the same... exact... event, and their chapter ended, I just thought, \"Okay, that's enough for tonight.\" And I closed the book.I mean, this is not a short novel - 450 pages to be exact. I read and read, and granted, some weird and interesting things happened, but it all just seemed a bit repetitive, and frankly, VERY unrealistic, which was SO frustrating to me, because the thing I appreciate most about Moriarty's writing is that her stuff is so REAL.As I was making my way through the last half of the book, I was thinking, \"Oh my God. I'm going to have to go on Goodreads and give Liane Moriarty a 3-star rating. Oh my God.\"At the very end, in just the last 30 pages, she somewhat pulled it off and wrapped up the story in a way I was not expecting and did enjoy.HOWEVER, I still feel like the pace in the middle was too slow, and the story was a bit far-fetched, but her delicious, funny, smart, vulnerable, relatable, likeable characters will always keep me coming back for more.", "Frances Welty, popular romance writer who'd just felt her first rejection, had thought her career and future were assured at fifty-five years of age. The impulsive booking at Tranquillum House, a health and wellness resort (which was expensive), had her questioning her own decisions on the long and tiring drive from Sydney. Her arrival showed her a beautiful old home built in the 1800s, renovated to within an inch of its life, with a staircase reminiscent of the Titanic (in the film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet; which made Frances smile) \u2013 perhaps she might enjoy it after all.Meeting the other eight guests \u2013 Carmel, Tony, Lars, Napolean and his wife Heather and daughter Zoe, Jessica and her husband Ben \u2013 felt strange. But even stranger was the fact the course started with five days of silence. Not a word to be spoken; no eye contact \u2013 five days! Frances knew that would be difficult. Within that period, there were meditation classes, walking, massage therapy, smoothies and meals, plus free time to swim in the luxurious pool. All to be done in silence.But each and every guest had a secret \u2013 and who were the people in charge of the resort? Were the guests comfortable with all that was happening to them? Some were \u2013 some most definitely weren\u2019t\u2026Nine Perfect Strangers is the latest by Aussie author Liane Moriarty and wow! How different, how intriguing, how bizarre \u2013 how fabulous! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and even with it being almost 500 pages, I flew through it. I can see this one being made into a movie \u2013 it would be fantastic on the big screen. I have no hesitation in recommending Nine Perfect Strangers highly, and wish to thank Pan Macmillan Australia for my uncorrected proof ARC to read in exchange for my honest review.", "Nine, worn-down-by-life, strangers, sign-up for an exclusive ten-day, mind and body total transformation retreat, but end up getting much more than they bargained for! I was expecting the Nine Perfect Strangers to be strangers to each other but this wasn\u2019t the case. Two were a married couple, while a further three were family members \u2013 father, mother, and their 20 year old daughter, while the remaining four were indeed strangers \u2013 two male, two female. Of course, the title does have a deeper, cleverer meaning that I am of course not going to reveal. The fact that some were related did make it admittedly easier to keep the various characters straight, as there were thirteen POV\u2019s \u2013 made up of the nine guests, three core staff, and one other (no spoilers!), so quite a few voices to keep up with.Nine Perfect Strangers isn\u2019t a thriller, crime, or mystery novel, and while there are moments of psychological suspense, there are not enough of them to bill it as that either. To be fair the back of the book doesn\u2019t mention any of the above genres, but because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to expect from Liane Moriarty even though I did quite like this, at the same time I couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed. I would call it contemporary, chick-lit \u2013 a light, entertaining, amusing romp, that would make an excellent beach read. I would even go as far as to call it a parody, as it does poke fun at itself several times, and the silliness towards the end screams deliberate. The characters were all interesting, and their reasons for attending a health retreat were moving, emotional, touching real world, relatable issues. The back of the book lists the following words \u2013 shame, guilt, loss, grief, privilege, insecurity, addiction, identity, love \u2013 and I think that sums up the novel nicely. So, all in all, it was well done, but I would\u2019ve preferred it to be crime, psychological suspense.", "*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.com\u2018She\u2019s back\u2019 exclaims the front cover of my proof copy of Nine Perfect Strangers, the latest release from household name and bestselling author Liane Moriarty. If you don\u2019t know who Liane Moriarty is I might mistake you for living under a rock! She is one of Australia\u2019s greatest exports, gracing the illusive New York Times bestseller list many times over. She also has close ties to Hollywood superstars Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, thanks to the HBO series Big Little Lies which is based on Moriarty\u2019s most well known book. So it is safe to say the anticipation bar for Nine Perfect Strangers was set high for me and many readers. Thankfully I am happy to report Moriarty\u2019s eighth novel is one entertaining page turner!In Nine Perfect Strangers Moriarty takes a slight departure from her popular domestic setting and moves her action to a rural location. Tranquillum House is a health and well resort, nestled in country NSW. This retreat offers a complete transformation experience, a total wellness overhaul. When nine discordant strangers descend on Tranquillum for its renowned ten day package, each has their own reasons and goals to achieve during their time at the resort. To support them during their time is the centre director, a woman with plenty of motivation to keep these nine people on their toes during their time at Tranquillum. But this ten day stay is turned on its head, quite literally, when something big transpires, altering the pathway of each of these guests.I recently read an interview with Liane Moriarty where she discusses the inspiration behind her latest novel, Nine Perfect Strangers. Moriarty cites a personal interest in the public\u2019s fascination and perhaps preoccupation with wellness retreats, our desire to attain a sense of spirituality and our obsession with self improvement. In some cases, the public can view these wellness centres as a kind of religion. I liked Moriarty\u2019s motivation and her willingness to delve into a world that perhaps we do not know a lot about. I know I personally have never visited a health retreat, so this story was an eye-opener! Moriarty\u2019s new novel sends a jeer in the way of these seductive resorts and our preoccupation with wellness. It is a scathing at times, insightful and a scintillating glimpse into the world of health retreats.As we have come to expect with Moriarty\u2019s novels, going on the back of the highly successful previous novels, Big Little Lies and The Husband\u2019s Secret, the characterisation is top notch in Nine Perfect Strangers. Moriarty spends a lot of time laying down the foundations and her scaffolding technique works. We soon build a solid picture of each and every one of the nine perfect strangers. There are a good cross section of players in this novel, from instant millionaires, to success stories, families and more. Moriarty also excels in her ability to show us both sides of the spectrum in this business, we see the workers and owners, as well as the patrons of this enterprise. It is fascinating! Each individual has their own unique journey, but they all converge and come to a head during the life changing stay at Tranquillum.Although at times the approach to the main subject matter and themes features in Nine Perfect Strangers is humourous and almost whimsical, buried underneath this facade are some serious themes. Moriarty uses Nine Perfect Strangers as a tool to expose issues such as guilt, loss, broken relationships, family politics, self image, wealth and reconciliation. When we think deeper about these issues, they are the everyday problems that ordinary people face in their day-to-day lives. Perhaps this is why Moriarty has such widespread appeal. It is her ability to focus on the normal aspects of human life, in such an accessible and dark humourous way.Moriarty is quite the plotter and she has quite the directive edge. There are a few plot twists and turns towards to end of the novel, that even now after finishing this book over a week ago, I am not entirely sure how I felt about the finale explosive big reveal. I find myself in a quandary as I am unable to discuss this aspect without venturing in spoiler territory. However, I have had the opportunity to discuss the pivotal final scenes of Nine Perfect Strangers with another respected author and like-minded reader. Our thoughts on this aspect of the novel were aligned. There is a kind of anti climax feeling attached to this part of the novel. I felt it and she did too. However, we both agreed that Moriarty is a fabulous storyteller and her characterisation is second to none!In all probability, Nine Perfect Strangers will hit the spot for Moriarty fans, it is one cloak and dagger tale that will have you mesmerised from the opening, through to that explosive ending!*Thanks extended to Pan Macmillan for providing a free copy of this book for review purposes.Nine Perfect Strangers, is book #124 of the Australian Women Writers Challenge", "An expensive ten-day retreat at an out-of-the-way spa for nine individuals.\u00a0 A health and wellness experience promising personal transformation, spiritual awakening, soul cleansing.\u00a0 No phones, no TV, no screens of any sort.\u00a0 Likewise, alcohol, junk food, sugar, books (!), etc. are verboten.\u00a0\u00a0You are assured of being a completely different person when you finish the course.\u00a0 Before it is over, the exercise will morph into something else entirely.\u00a0 \u00a0In looking at my GR friends' reviews, I see we are all over the place with this one.\u00a0\u00a0To me, reading this novel was like eating ice cream, irresistible and perhaps slightly indulgent, but pure pleasure nevertheless.", "Nine Perfect Strangers is the second book I have read by Liane Moriarty. Her books seem to generate a lot of interest but this one seems to have mixed opinions.....Nine strangers.A remote luxury retreat in the Australian outback.Ten days that promise to change your life.Each character had their own reasons for being there.....a failed career, marriage problems, loss of confidence, loss of a loved one.Moriarty writes so well, she is funny, sharpe and occasionally scathing as she eeks out the details of each person\u2019s life and what lead them to being on the retreat. And what a retreat! Luxury rooms, dedicated staff, experienced masseurs but as the days tick by the activities take on a more and more bizarre turn.Although billed as a thriller I don\u2019t think it really falls into this category. A very enjoyable read. Not amazing but it was certainly entertaining and I want to read more by Moriarty.

What words can do this book justice? I've felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as I've read them. I didn't experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here, but in some ways I think it's just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood. I have kids, so I was constantly wondering how my 5 year old will accept these books when she's a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes. The holidays are always a busy, stressful time for us. All of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and, on top of that, we're moving into our new place this month. All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day, and this was the perfect book to do so with. No matter your age, the magical world of Hogwarts is truly spectacular; the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you weren't sure existed for us old farts anymore. If you have been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years like I have, I highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like I did. Time is a precious commodity these days, and you couldn't spend it in a better way than with these precious kiddos.", "\n(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: A clever conjuration, it's a cozy castle mystery, a creature-fest, and Ripper-esque: lit by monsters, ghosts, and history.\n", "\u201cI'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there.\u201d- me reading Harry Potter for the 14th timeTo say it with the words of the cute 7-year old that I read this book to: \"It was good but badder than the first book.\"This is Harry Potter. Nothing can ever beat a Harry Potter book. Apart from another Harry Potter book. And in this book series, this is my least favourite one. There's just so many things I don't like reading about. Harry and Ron stealing the car and flying it to Hogwarts? Gilderoy Lockhart? Nah, I could happily go without it.But then there's things that are just brilliant. The Valentines dwarf singing Harry a love song, Hermione Granger being a genius through and through, Fawkes, unwillingly funny Moaning Myrtle...I think one of the reasons this may be the weakest part of the series is that it resembles Part One so much: Someone tries to hurt Harry during Quidditch, there's a hidden chamber deep underneath Hogwarts and Harry has to face Voldemort in said chamber.Now, you have to understand that there is nothing I love more than Harry Potter, and this book is one of the most brilliant things ever written. I'm a proud Potterhead and Gryffindor and will always love this world.Find more of my books on Instagram", "Re-Read in December 2015 for Harry Christmas to YouThis time around I realized how much more entertaining this book is compared to the movie. Nothing against the movie because I LOVE it, but this book has so many more fun scenes! Like Arthur and Lucius PHYSICALLY FIGHTING EACH OTHER and Dobby tossing Lucius down a flight of stairs at the end. Reading this aloud with Kyle literally had us laughing like crazy. I love this series so much oh my Rowling.Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MY LORD VOLDEMORT.In this book we get more little hints to events to come in future books (Horcrux stuff, a mention of Voldemort having left a part of himself/his powers in Harry, etc.) WHICH WAS AWESOME. I find that every time I read these books I notice more things, which was definitely true this time around. One thing I did notice, which COULD HAVE SOLVED EVERYTHING:At the beginning of the book when they're leaving for King's Cross, Ginny forgets her diary and has to back for it. SHE NEARLY LEFT IT BEHIND. OH MAN. Overall, this was a great time, but I'm excited to finally get to my favorite books in the series!!!", "Re-read audio 2017 \u2665Okay, I'm going to do a little *spoilery* in this review so those of you that haven't read the book then you might just want to look at the pictures. I have picked a ton of pictures from the book but believe me, there are plenty more beautiful ones in the book. Plus, if your a Harry Potter fan you will be getting the book anyway if you haven't already!So poor Harry is stuck back with the Dursley's on Privet Drive. And even though Harry is a relative, they still treat him like poo because he's magical. Ewwwwww. Harry is depressed because he has be cut off from talking to his friends or getting any kind of correspondence. Even poor Hedwig has been locked in her cage and hasn't been able to fly around. CRUEL! But Harry can't use magic inside the muggle world. Then Harry meets Doby - the little house-elf that is waiting for him in his room. It turns out that Doby has been intercepting his correspondence because he fears for Harry's life and doesn't want him to return to Hogwarts. So Doby causes some problems at the house that get Harry in trouble. I had to add this cute little picture of Doby running off, look at his little butt. lol \u2193Then one night, Ron, George and Fred pull up outside Harry's window in their dads flying car to save Harry. It's pretty funny how they get it all going but that is okay as long as Harry gets away from his evil relatives. Of course, Mrs. Weasley is not pleased when they get back home. The sneaking out part didn't work very well, but she welcomed Harry with open arms and he stayed with them until it was time for them all to go back to school. I love that picture of the Weasley house =) Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like himPoor sweet Harry and I would love to live with the Weasleys' for a bit =) Look at cute, fat little Scabbers \u2193The kids are going to meet Hermione to get some shopping done. But ole Harry takes a wrong turn down the chimney hole and ends up in some creepy shop. He hides and gets to hear some things Malfoy and his father are talking about.Finally Harry makes it out of the store and Hagrid finds him and gets him to the right place with his friends. Then Ron and Harry are blocked from getting on the train soooooo back to stealing the flying car. AND of course they get into trouble when they get to Hogwarts but it wasn't anything too bad. Snape looked as though Christmas had been cancelled. He cleared his throat and said. 'Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree . . . surely acts of this nature . . . 'It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'They are in her house and are therefore her responsibility.' He turned to Professor McGonagall. 'I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample.'There is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor named Gideroy Lockhart. He's a bit off but still . . . Anyway things are not right at Hogwarts. (are they ever?) And Harry and the gang must figure out what's going on. Poor ole Hagrid gets sent off to Azkaban for something he didn't do! Malfoy is a jerk, as if we didn't know that. lol Harry and Ron go out in the woods to meet Aragog the spider that is friends of Hagrid to find out some truth behind some stuff. Comes to find out there is this diary of a person named Tom Riddle. I'm not telling you who this person really is but they are the one causing all kinds of trouble for a lot of people. In the end Harry has to end up fighting a Basilisk to set things right. He has the help of the sorting hat for reasons, Dumbledore's Phoenix and a sword. Oh happy day! There is loads more to the book then the things I have described but you can just read it and if you haven't, why haven't you? Harry Potter rocks and always will. There is another happy ending for sweet Doby! \u2665Harry gives Dobby his stinky sock so this releases Doby. He now has his freedom from the evil Lucius Malfoy! Woot! 'Come, Dobby, I said, Come!'But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 'Master has given Dobby a sock,' said the elf in wonderment. 'Master gave it to Dobby.''What's that?' spat Mr. Malfoy. 'What did you say?''Dobby has got a sock,' said Dobby in disbelief. 'Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby-Dobby is free.'Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged for Harry. 'You've lost me my servant, boy!'But Dobby shouted, 'You shall not harm Harry Potter!'There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backwards. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumbled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long threatening finger. 'You shall go now,' he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. 'You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.'Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him ad hurried out of sight.This book is wonderful, it always has been and always will, and the graphics in this book make it even better. \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List", "ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) / ITALIANOBedtime reading for my daughter (and second reading for me). It is once again exciting to wander across the Hogwarts halls, observing the mysterious facts that involve the protagonists, just like we were there too. This is Rowling's rare gift: making sure that we see through the eyes of Harry, Ron and Hermione.The summer holidays have passed, and the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's power is still immature, but Dumbledore's teaching is adamant:\u00abIt is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities\u00bb This time, our young wizards are struggling with the new professor of defense against the dark arts, the dork and vein Gilderoy Lockhart, called to replace Professor Quirrell (died in the previous adventure). However, the joyful atmosphere is soon ruined: strange events begin to happen...Far be it from me to spoiler something of this mystery-fantasy. J.K. Rowling gives us another masterpiece to live, rather than to read. Actually, I do not know if my daughter was more pleased than me to hear this novel, or if I was happier than her to read it and literally interpret it (I even modulated the voices of the different characters).

A conti fatti, non so se sia stata pi\u00f9 contenta mia figlia di sentirselo raccontare, o se sia stato pi\u00f9 contento io di leggerlo e letteralmente interpretarlo (ho perfino modulato le voci dei diversi personaggi).

I can\u2019t believe that I forgot so many things. Like for instance the fact that Dumbledore actually was a Transfiguration teacher before he became headmaster. Kinda suitable that this is McGonagall\u2019s role now. ;-) 1.) \u201dHarry Potter asks if he can help Dobby \u2026 Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew\u2026\u201dAww Dobby! It was so good to see him again! He\u2019s really one of the best HP characters ever and this even though he made it kind of tough to like him. *lol* Well, at least at the beginning. Poor Harry! XD2.) \u201dYour sons flew that car to Harry\u2019s house and back last night!\u201d shouted Mrs Weasley. \u201cWhat have you got to say about that, eh?\u201d\u201cDid you really?\u201d said Mr Weasley eagerly. \u201cDid it go all right? I-I mean,\u201d he faltered, as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley\u2019s eyes, \u201cthat-that was very wrong, boys \u2013 very wrong indeed \u2026\u201dI\u2019ll always love how Mr Weasley is more interested in finding out if the car flew well than in his kids actually flying the car! *lol* Also Molly Weasley giving him hell for not reacting the way a responsible parent is supposed to is just epic! Haha! Those two. You can see they have a great marriage! ;-P3.) \u201dMr Weasley had a cut lip and Mr Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools.\u201dHow could I forget that Mr Weasley threw himself at Malfoy? One of the best things in this book ever! Not that I support violence (I\u2019m a pacifist) but even I can\u2019t help appreciating that Lucius Malfoy for once, actually had his ass handed to him. XD 4.) \u201dThat vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\u201d he was saying gleefully to Mrs Norris. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet.\u201dHow come I never noticed this before?! The foreboding!!! OMG! Like damn, there are so many things that are mentioned only briefly and rather casually and then when you continue to read the series they reappear with a vengeance! O_o With every book I read I\u2019m more and more awed by J.K Rowling\u2019s genius! 5.) \u201dHomework: compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\u201dGilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself! I swear he must have been the worst DADA teacher they ever had. And they had many over the years which even Dumbledore can\u2019t deny. Loved that bit at the ending when he said he\u2019d have to write an ad because they \u201cseem to run through them\u201d. *lol*6.) \u201dYou are Muggle-born?\u201d\u201cHalf-blood, sir,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cMuggle father, witch mother.\u201dThere definitely was a history lesson hidden in there. It\u2019s fascinating how Riddle of all people could be a half-blood and then go against Muggle born wizards! I\u2019m sure J.K. Rowling thought about World War II when she wrote this, because all the pure-blood and half-blood etc. stuff reminds me of a very dark chapter in German history\u2026 >_<7.) \u201dBut why\u2019s she got to go to the library?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s what Hermione does,\u201d said Ron, shrugging. \u201cWhen in doubt, go to the library.\u201dDid anyone notice how well Ron knows Hermione? And how often he defended her in this book? I mean he actually would have fought Malfoy with his bare hands if Harry and Dean would have allowed it! It\u2019s so obvious that Ron cares about her deeply! To vomit snails without complaining about it should count as the ultimate indication of eternal love and affection! *LOL*8.) \u201dOf course,\u201d she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye.McGonagall losing it was another great moment in this book! When you least expect it she always shows some kindness and heart and to be honest this never ceases to amaze me! XD She\u2019s a great teacher and I\u2019m not surprised that she always takes over when Dumbledore isn\u2019t around. 9.) \u201dYou\u2019re in luck,\u201d said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. \u201cWe think we know where it is. And what\u2019s inside it. Let\u2019s go.\u201dI just love Harry, okay?! *lol* For such a young kid he certainly has a lot of guts and courage! The way he dealt with Lockhart? I think not even an adult wizard could have done it any better. XD The sheer audacity to demand aid from him like that. YES! Haha! <310.) (view spoiler)[\u201dVoldemort put a bit of himself in me?\u201d Harry said, thunderstruck.\u201dI CAN\u2019T BELIEVE ROWLING ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IN BOOK TWO!!! I mean Harry quite literally said that Voldemort put a bit of himself in him!!! A part of his soul!!! It\u2019s so obvious that Harry is a Horcrux!!! GAH!!! It\u2019s all there and I never saw it!!! That\u2019s just brilliant! Dumbledore must have known all along! I really need to reread the entire series because I can\u2019t remember if he already knew it right from the beginning or if it was just a theory at first.  (hide spoiler)]I can\u2019t wait to read \u201cThe Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d! I\u2019m afraid it might have to wait until next year though! So many books, so little time! ;-) ______________________________As always I loved this! <3And boy there were so many hints! The foreboding is real in this one! *lol*Also I kinda like that every book ends with the school year and that there\u2019s no cliff-hanger!

The magical wizarding world of Harry, his friends, and the folks at Hogwart's is just FUN to read about. I am in LOVE with Fawkes the phoenix and I adore Dumbledore...And now I am so worried something bad is going to happen to one of them over the course of the remaining books. And, yes, I know it's probably made you gasp in shock that - in addition to never having read the books before now - I have also never seen any of the movies...and I truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series. I guess it IS possible to blissfully ignore spoilers for over two decades...unless we are talking about Game of Thrones. Good luck making it a fucking day with all the assholes posting every single scene on Twitter. Not that I'm on Twitter...But I digress.

Rowling's ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it's big and hideous problems. We all know, after all, that she covered discrimination, wars, hate crime, the Kardashians, etc.Let's take this book for example. Harry goes back to Hogwarts. Now enter Gilderoy Lockhart. A fame enamored charlatan, who knows nothing about anything, except memory spells. So clearly a Kardashian. Now some might ask: do Kardashians know memory spells. And the answer is clearly YES! Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13, so some magic must be at work, otherwise you'd have to think the world has gone mad!!!!!Carrying on, Harry has an awful year, mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language. Actually all of Harry's life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you, hence Harry might've been modeled after Lindsay Lohan. But Rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that Harry ended up fine in the end... mostly.And to crown all of this awful year, he meets Tom Riddle, who is the heir of Slytherin. He also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet. So definitely a forefather of Taylor Swift. And look at what that those family ties made her do!! Lessons to be learned from here, people!Now, of course, a lot of questions remain: will the Kardashians magic still work for long? Will Taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa?

Quick thoughts on the things that stood out to me: Wow, the Dursleys were even more loathsome in this book than the first. I love the Weasleys even more than I already did.I am so glad my mother never sent me a Howler.I thought Dobby was annoying in the movie (which I saw when it came out over a decade ago, not having read the book) but I thought he was awesome in the book. In fact, we rewatched the movie last night, and not only was it as unsatisfying as I remember it, it's just a shit adaptation of this book.I thought it was delightful that (view spoiler)[the flying car went into the Forbidden Forest and went feral (hide spoiler)].Tom Riddle's diary was really, really awesome. The entire idea and execution were fantastic.I loved it when Dumbledore told Harry, \"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" I hope that, as the series goes on, we have more scenes with him, because I really love his wisdom.My minor complaints seem a little nitpicky, and I suppose that if I'm going to suspend disbelief to accept that wizards are real, I should be able to accept that (view spoiler)[none of the adults at Hogwarts would look in Hermione's fist to see the paper that Harry and Ron found after she was Petrified (hide spoiler)] and (view spoiler)[Fawkes somehow just found his way into the Chamber of Secrets (hide spoiler)], but I'm an adult and if I'd read this as a kid I wouldn't have cared for a single moment.", "In memory of Alan Rickman who showed us what Severus Snape looks like on the Big Screen.I made myself a promise not to use any stills from any Harry Potter movies in my reviews for any book of the series, but I have to make an exception today January 14, 2016 thus the image above.Even people who somehow managed to avoid reading the books and seeing the movies can guess that this book is about Harry Potter's second year the School of Wizardry, Hogwarts. Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him. Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harry's life full of excitement: he is convinced Harry's life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts, so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this. Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive. To add to the fun it seems Harry's life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at. Like the first one, this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments; children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale. We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones. Speaking about new people, Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent. His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud. I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person - he is another interesting guy; the last scene with him is excellent. I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little. I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series; he is just a guy who always gets either lucky, or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots. I saw Hermione named the main hero - she is the brainpower behind Harry's successes most of the time. I saw Neville named the main hero - he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters. I would respectfully disagree: Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one (compare him to Lockhart to see why). For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel. This was my reread of the book; I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with 4 stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early. Any book which can do it to me deserves 5 stars. I do not have anything else to add to what I already said; each installment of the series was analyzed and reviewed countless number of times by better qualified people. I will stop right here.", "\nI read this all in one 8 hour sitting...

Rowling Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a fantasy novel written by British author J.K. Rowling, and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the \"Chamber of Secrets\" has been opened and that the \"heir of Slytherin\" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school \"petrified\" (frozen like stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks. The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later, in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc.\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627: \u0647\u0631\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u062d\u0641\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u061b \u0647\u0631\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u062c\u0648\u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0644\u06cc\u0646 (\u062c\u06cc.\u06a9\u06cc.) \u0631\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2000 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u061b \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631: \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0622\u06af\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644 2001 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0647\u0631\u06cc \u067e\u0627\u062a\u0631 \u0648 \u062d\u0641\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0622\u0645\u06cc\u0632 -

I can't say for sure why I don't love it as much as the others, but it's just never stood out to me.However, upon rereading it, I am reminded again how great Rowling is at developing a story arc! There are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book! Especially with Tom Riddle showing up, the diary, hints of Ron's affection for Hermione, and overall just building up the characters and storyline. It's also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on.Here are some thoughts on things I noticed or didn't remember about this book while I was reading it:-Like in one of the Harry Potter video games, Ron and Harry de-gnome the Burrow's garden at the beginning of the book. -Hermione's parents actually go to Diagon Alley and exchange Muggle money at Gringott's!-Why wasn't Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party in the movie? Also he died in 1492 which is when Columbus 'discovered' America. Significant?-\"And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.\" (p.231) Sounds familiar.-I really wish they had the Valentine's Day party in the movie, with all the dwarves walking around dressed as cupids and delivering love messages.-Aragog is literally my biggest fear.-Apparently Dumbledore, back in the day, was a Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.-And finally, I knew Voldemort was an heir of Slytherin, duh, but I didn't realize he was the last heir of Slytherin. Dun dun duuuun.5/5 stars because even when it's my least favorite of the seven, it's still perfect.", "\nSecond Read Review\n This book was so much fun! And I honestly enjoyed it more than the first time I read it. I didn't know how much I forgot about this book until I reread it, so I probably enjoyed it very much because I mostly forgot many things in this book. So there are also some things that I want to talk about, \n Gilderoy Lockhart \n He was so annoying and irked me so much. Especially in the scene where he set loose of pixies in Defence Against the Dark Arts class and he couldn't even fix this mess! And told Harry, Ron and Hermione to put them back in the cage and he left them, I was like \" what the hell? \" he's so unbelievable. But I must admit that he made me laugh like in the Duelling Club, he was disarmed by Snape and that scene was so funny until I laughed out loud. I disliked him very much for lying about those stories! He's such a liar. Ugh. Oh and he deserved what he got in the end that he lost his memory because Ron's wand backfired at him. \nHermione Granger\nI was shocked when I realized that Hermione liked Lockhart. That guy was so annoying. Maybe he was charming BUT he didn't even know any useful spells, like when Harry broke his arm, he conjured a spell and that spell caused Harry to lose his bones in his arm! He just made it worse instead of helping him. And even though I was shocked, I also laughed when I knew that Hermione put a Get Well card from lockhart under her pillow when she was in the hospital wing hahahahaha. I guess she really liked him. that scene was just so funny. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Well, overall I really enjoyed re-reading this book and I'm going to read the third book now! Bye! \u2764\ufe0f\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022Edit : Rounded it up into 5 starsREVIEW TO COME ON SATURDAY! ^^4.8 Stars \n\" It is our choice, Harry, That show what we truly are, Far more than our abilities \"\nOkay guys, before I started reviewing this book, I wanted to tell you something. This saturday, I read this book until 04:30 am and I completely didn't realise that I was reading for 4 hours or so and on that same day I had an economy course with my teacher and I completely forgot about that too until my mom reminded me of it. the course started at 10:00 am o'clock and I woke up at 11:00 am and maybe I'll get into a little bit trouble when I'm coming to school on Monday because of this. But I really couldn't help it! THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD AND I COULD NOT STOP READING IT!! okay now let's talking about this book! \nMy Opinion\nomg! this book! I had a lot of feelings! Anger. Sadness. Happiness and many more and the chapter I most loved was The Duelling Club. it was so funny to see Professor Snape disarmed Lockhart until he was flying because of the impact of Professor Snape's spell hahaha. xDI don't like calling Lockhart a Professor because he clearly didn't know any spells that were usefull for his students or anyone... Maybe just a Memory Charm. but it was only usefull for him to do his nasty business. ugh and he was a liar too. all those books he wrote were all faked. If Hogwarts were real, I would be really happy to learn all about Defence Against The Dark Arts. this is the most interesting subject that have really caught my interest since I began reading the first book. what about you guys? tell me on the comment section below! ^^and that Duelling Club was so amazing! learning how to fight with spells! and what schocked me was that Voldemort was used to be a human! and Voldemort was not his real name. His real name was Tom Marvolo Riddle but he changed it. I mean, not an ordinary human,of course. he was a half-blood. his father was a muggle and his mother was a witch. I knew he was a Slytherin and he studied at Hogwarts too but I never thought him as half-blood was or a child or a teenager. because he was so evil that I couldn't even imagine what he would look like in the past and he *coughs coughs * used to be handsome...oh! I love Quidditch too! I don't really like sports but it's different with Quidditch. Quidditch is wonderful and amazing! I even always scream like \" YOU CAN DO IT HARRY! YOU CAN CATCH IT!\" and when Gryffindor wins I always scream like \" YAY!! GRYFFINDOR! GRYFFINDOR! \" Am I weird? hahaaha. AHHH. I wish Hogwarts were real. I wish I were at least a muggle-born. I have only read two books in Harry Potter series but they already have changed my life. thank you guys for reading and liking this review! I hope you guys have a great day and Happy Reading!! \u2764\u2764", "first read: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fsecond read: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f // buddy read with ines!this book was absolutely brilliant!

It's Harry Potter. This book was just as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, if not better! This one definitely gave me the feels, you know what I mean? Harry, Ron, and Hermione's characters really did improve in a lot of ways. I should explain, but c'mon. Im pretty sure you're aware of the fact that everything in this series is \npure perfection.\n The plot was a roller coaster ride! The ending was an on-my-fucking-god-just-happened-moment. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was perfection.

Mysterious! & Cute!My favourite book in the middle grade-ish side (1, 2, 3) of HP.I enjoyed every moment of it, every time. every page has something new.& Always my first TOP favourite. (above OotP & GoF)& I'm always wondering why this beautiful, cute, exciting, mysterious, full of backstories & plot-twist book is so many people's least favourite one in the series :(it is the cutest & no one can tell me otherwise. :Dtbh all of them are magical & wonderful! my heart beats for them. <3-Second book, starting with a blow. Can I appreciate the beginning of the book, the first chapter, the title, how it is started, how it summarized the events on the last book & let us swim in this world once again. craving for magic. I always love the beginning of every HP book, it is very unique & fun. for example: \"... Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.\"& how suddenly everything goes wrong. XDin this book, wizarding world expanded. we're more into this world. how do a wizard family actually live; by knowing the amazing Weasleys.we meet new great characters; we didn't know in the first book like Mr. Weasley. also more Fred & George & Mrs. Weasley....full of intriguing Backstories, Mysteries, Histories, Riddles & plot twists!many fun moments & laughter because of Ron Weasley's comments. & don't forget young Harry being sassy.how could everyone (characters I mean, idk about the fans, but I know I, myself, didn't think like that.) think of Harry like that!? (view spoiler)[being the one who attacked students? just because he is a parseltongue? he's not pureblood mania, like Malfoy. Dammit! his friend is muggleborn. he is a good guy. (hide spoiler)] tho I always enjoy to see my favourite characters under pressure, gives me the excitement. guilty pleasure.& I think I'm the only one who likes Lockhart (not much, but still), I mean he was annoying & (view spoiler)[a liar & actually a fraud (hide spoiler)], but hilarious, he made the scenes funny because of his nonsense megalomaniac & of course Harry & Ron's expression toward him.

Not for any particular reason but about 10 years ago I didn't think I would be into it. Fast forward a decade and I'm now working my way through what I can say already is a children's classic fantasy series that is up there with The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia. Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car. Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics. A new tutor is introduced this time, Professor Lockhart and I thought he was brilliant mainly due to how awful he was with his tall-tales and celebrity status! This narrative is brimming with ghosts, boys and girls who adore Harry, spiders, and Professor Sprout. The characters are pretty brilliant and I can easily understand why this is adored globally. I didn't need the continuous info-dumps that reminded me what happened in book one but apart from that there isn't really anything negative to say. The ending was surprising with a cool twist, a magic hat, a phoenix, a sword, a diary, and a giant snake. I hope you don't tell me off for these spoilers as I'm sure I'm the only fantasy book reviewer who hasn't read these yet. I'm loving the adventure so far. These books are what I go to for now when I want no-nonsense, uncomplex awesomeness. Love it.", "Before I say anything else, it's important you know that I LOVE HARRY POTTER. In my fingers and my toes. LOVE.That being said, this is my least favorite of the early books (I'll let you know whether it's my least favorite overall after I reread HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX).The reasons are LEGION:1. Gilderoy Lockhart is a prat and I hate him.2. Deathday party. It's creepy and gross.3. Poor Ginny.4. The trouble Harry and Ron get Mr. Weasley into stresses me out.5. I don't like snakes.6. I HATE spiders.7. Dobby needs to calm the eff down:BUT. This is Harry Potter we're talking about, so there's also plenty of awesomeness:1. Dwarves dressed as cupids, delivering singing valentines.2. MOLLY WEASLEY.3. Ford Anglia in the wilds of the Forbidden Forest.4. Polyjuice Potion5. Gnomes shouting \"geroff.\"6. (view spoiler)[Lucius Malfoy getting taken down a peg. (hide spoiler)]SO. Even if this is my least favorite, it's still Harry Potter, and Harry Potter = AWESOME. If you haven't already, READ IT. If you have read it, read it AGAIN.

It was truly incredible and I have SO MUCH to say about it I wish I could actually just send everyone a howler containing the entire script of this book instead.\n\u201cWhat's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201d\nIn all honesty, The Hate U Give has made me realize just how simply clueless I was as to the continuing day-to-day actuality of systemic racism in America. A reality in which on any given day, some innocent person like Tommy Le can get shot hours before his high-school graduation because he was carrying a pen, or another innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she is going to end up dead in jail, or  a five years old child can get shot and wounded after the police kills his mother. A reality in which justice is dead and the police kills black youth with impunity.And so many other real stories I read about that truly made the atoms making up my body have enough of being anchored to this awful reality in this human form and wish to move on, become a light wave or something.See, I don\u2019t know what it's like to be black in America, but I have 18 years of experience in being a brown Muslim woman and I can tell you this: being in the minority is like being stuck behind a glass wall and whenever an injustice occurs, you breathe onto it and you write it in HUGE letters in the condensation...but nobody seems to really see it. Nobody seems to really see you. You\u2019re completely and utterly alone.(x)The Hate U Give is about institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system where the police can violate the civil rights of thousands of people publicly and openly with almost no consequence at all. It's about what happens when racialized and marginalized communities stand up for their rights in any visible way whatsoever. It\u2019s about how piles and piles of evidence showing sustained corruption and racism and literally hundreds of civilian deaths per year at the hands of the police is still somehow not enough to delegitimize a deeply flawed system. It's about how instead of standing in unwavering solidarity with the non-violent protests by Black Lives Matter in the face of actually violent, overtly discriminatory and often fatal actions by the police and demanding societal redress and justice, there will always be people who will decry and get enraged by it, people who will try to justify those injustices by any means to curb their own cognitive dissonance. \n\u201cA hairbrush is not a gun.\u201d \nI mean, this is the 21st century. We evolved. America had elected its first black president. Humanity must've left \u2018racism\u2019 back up in the trees from the jungles we descended from.... right?Maybe there just aren't many \u201csocial experiments\u201d on YouTube where privileged folks get to dress up like oppressed groups and have cameras following them around in order to find out that racism is real, since apparently you really need the personal account of a white non-Muslim girl who tries on a hijab for a week to find out that racism and islamophobia do indeed exist, or a straight person pretending to be gay to find out that homophobia does exist, or an able-bodied person pretending to be disabled to find out that ableism does exist.You don't need any \u201csocial experiments\u201d to understand oppression. You don\u2019t need to plagiarize lived experiences when you can just listen. Not to the personal accounts filtered through a white person but listen to the testimonials of all the people of color across the globe who experience these issues first hand - no matter what their socio-economic standing is, and who are ignored when they actually reach out to educate you even though they shouldn't even have to. No one should have to debate about whether or not they should have basic human rights. No one should be expected to be the mouth piece for an entire group. No one should have to defend their humanity at every single step, repeatedly and constantly. But racism does exist.And I don't usually comment on other people's reviews, but if you\u2019ve read this book and chose to ignore the important message it conveys to get offended over the main character\u2019s remark about the way white people call 'target' tar-jay and \u201chey hey that\u2019s racist!\u201d because you think a harmless joke could possibly equate thousands of black lives unjustly killed every year at the hands of the police, or say \u201cbut what if it was the other way around?\" when you have zero concept of power dynamics and historical context, you are missing the point.Now you can justify your outrage by bringing up the definition of racism like I\u2019ve seen so many people do, but I don\u2019t think dictionary definitions will help you there when they are the most basic forms of words and often can\u2019t even be taken in a sociological sense. Just like how they won\u2019t help with the usual cries of \u2018reverse racism\u2019 or even the moronic nonsense like trying to claim that anti-Islamic bigotry is not racist because \u201cIslam is not a race\u201d. It won\u2019t change the fact that members of marginalized groups suffer under the yoke of all forms of social inequality, from racism to misogyny to ableism to so much more on a daily basis. It won't change the fact that these words are a constant, inevitable factors of the lives of the minority, all found on different levels of existence, all carrying various levels of trauma.I think Scott Woods said it best when he said that racism is bigger than just \u201cconscious hate\u201d. That it might look like hate but it is just one manifestation. And privilege is another. Access is another. Ignorance is another. Apathy is another. \n\u201cYou can destroy wood and brick, but you can't destroy a movement.\u201d \nKhalil's story is one I will never forget, just like I won't forget all the real stories this book has opened my eyes to.(x)", "\nThe truth casts a shadow over the kitchen\u2014people like us in situations like this become hashtags, but they rarely get justice. I think we all wait for that one time though, that one time when it ends right.Maybe this can be it.\nThere are those books that are important and timely, worthy of reading because of the social and/or political message that they send. They fill a gap in the market; they make waves. They need to exist. And there are other books that are well-written, emotionally-charged and unputdownable - books that are not important as such, just really fucking good. But, on occasion, you find one of those rare wonderful creatures that is both important AND really fucking good.The Hate U Give is one of those books.I could tell you that this book is inspired by the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. I could tell you that it rips unapolegetically into a subject that needed to be ripped into - the shootings of unarmed black people by police officers, as well as racial bias in the justice system. I could tell you that it opened my eyes to aspects of white privilege I never considered. All of that needs to be said, for sure, but I feel like I'm doing this book a disservice by highlighting its sociopolitical importance over the fact that it's also a fantastic, powerful and utterly unforgettable book.I don't know what your experiences were as a child, but when I was young, I remember my parents giving me a talk about how if I was ever lost or in trouble, I should look for a police officer. They would protect me, look after me, and make sure I got back to my parents unharmed. They are the people in society we should be able to trust. But the black protagonist of this book - Starr - gets a very different talk. About how to behave around police officers so she doesn\u2019t get arrested. Or shot.Unfortunately, her friend - Khalil - never got that talk.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen over and over again: a black person gets killed just for being black, and all hell breaks loose. I\u2019ve Tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down.Now I am that person, and I\u2019m too afraid to speak.\nThe Hate U Give is about how Starr deals with the aftermath of witnessing Khalil being shot by a cop for... doing absolutely nothing wrong. Her fear is palpable as she confronts a system that she knows is working against her. She's afraid to speak out, yet angry that Khalil's murderer could escape justice. We see, through Starr's eyes, how the media presents young black men as guilty until proven innocent - and when you're poor, black, and from a rough neighborhood, it's virtually impossible to appear innocent.Though, at its heart, this book first and foremost captures the perspective of a scared young girl. A girl with a loving family, complicated friendships with white teenagers at her school, and a white boyfriend. The relationship dynamics run alongside the fight for justice and are no less compelling. Thomas deftly portrays complex, nuanced relationships between all the people in the book, considering the divides between Starr and her white classmates, but never allowing anyone to become cliche or one-dimensional.Little humorous gems lay scattered throughout the dialogue:\nMomma reaches her fork onto my plate and breaks off a piece of pancake. \u201cWhat is Tumblr anyway? Is it like Facebook?\u201d\u201cNo, and you\u2019re forbidden to get one. No parents allowed. You guys already took over Facebook.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t responded to my friend request yet.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cI need Candy Crush lives.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never respond.\u201d\nIt's incredible how The Hate U Give manages to both break your heart and warm it in the space of just a few pages.What else can I even say? If you want to have your heart ripped out - read this book. If you want to read a great book about a girl dealing with family and relationships - read this book. If you want to cry, laugh, and then cry some more - read this book. If you're ready to change this stupid fucking world - read this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "This is a  MUST READ  for 2017 releases.I absolutely adored this book. I truly don't feel like it has a single flaw. Every topic addressed was approach so wonderfully and did not hold back. If you're looking for a diverse read that stands out amongst most YA,  The Hate U Give  is the book for you.I love Starr Carter so much. She's honestly such an inspiration to girls looking to find their voice. She is resilient, authentic, and everything we need in adolescents today. Although she is not completely fearless, she embraces the adversity in her way and stands against it. I don't know many people who could juggle the stresses in her life and come out weapons (in this case, words) blazing. Every moment in this book just filled me with pride for this girl and it was a pleasure being able to watch her grow.I also love the family dynamic in this book. I think it honestly might be the most healthy, realistic, close-knit family I've ever read in a YA. The siblings may tease each other, but they protect each other fiercely. The parents may not always get along, but they are head over heels in love. They always attempt to do what is best for their children, even if it may not be their own personal preference. It was so nice to have just a scene of a family sitting down to watch sports together, throwing a pool party, always working together. It is something I truly valued from this read.The strongest aspect of this book is it's social commentary and political criticism. This is the kind of book that should be in the hands of teens, making them aware of current issues, educating them on pressing matters, and encouraging them to get involved to create change. I absolutely left this read with an entirely new perspective I will carry with me in the future. It poses many important questions about racism, police brutality, discrimination, and prejudice while also answering them in a comprehensive and inviting way. It was fascinating to see the integration of such a powerful movement implemented into an accessible form of media for teens. I truly don't think you can leave this book without SOMETHING that will have made you say \"I never thought about it this way\", \"When you put it this way, that actually makes a lot of sense.\", and \"I'm glad someone finally told me this.\"Although this book is full of important moments related to the current state of marginalized populations, it is primarily about using your voice. I believe this book has the power to make readers realize just how much their words matter. Starr Carter is a perfect example of an individual who feels their voice does not matter but through courage, risk-taking, and ultimate strength, she realizes how crucial it is to speak up for what you are passionate about no matter how terrifying the consequences may seem. And I believe you will leave this book with that revelation as well.I cannot recommend this book enough. It's absolutely one of my favorite books of the year. I am so happy The Hate U Give exists, and I'm even more ecstatic that it is a 1! NYT best seller, out in to the world, ready to help teens realize how important they really are. Please pick up \"THUG\". You will not regret it.", "\u201cWhat's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201dEvery white person on this planet needs to read this book.\"Lack of opportunities. Corporate America don't bring jobs to our communities, and they damn sure ain't quick to hire us. Then, even if you do have a high school diploma, so many schools in our neighbourhoods don't prepare us well enough. Our schools don't get the resources to equip you. It's easier to find some crack than it is to find a good school around here.Now think 'bout this. How did the drugs even get in our neighborhood? This is a multibillion-dollar industry. That shit is flown into our communities but I don't know anybody with a private jet.Drugs come from somewhere, and they're destroying our community.You got folks like Brenda, who think they need them to survive, and then you got the Khalils, who think they need to sell them to survive. The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab unless they get jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spend most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again.That's the hate they're giving us, a system designed against us. That's Thug life.\"This book opened my eyes. I don't want to say too much, but I love how popular this book is, being No. 1 on the NYT bestseller list and already having cast Amandla Stenberg as the lead actress in the movie adaption. We need this, America needs this, YA fiction needs this. Angie Thomas gets so many things right, and so many readers can learn about black culture, cultural appropriation, covert and internalized racism and so much more through this.Apart from that, this book is simply good. It could be a biography, that's how realistic it feels. The characters have depth, the plot isn't overly dramatic but still exciting. And honestly, it's so so hilarious. Doesn't matter if the characters are joking about Voldemort or getting their butts whooped by their parents, it's laugh-out-loud material. The first few pages might be a little difficult to get through because it takes a while to get used to the writing and the slang, but keep going, it's worth it. The thing is, I wasn't overly emotional while reading this. I didn't cry ugly tears, didn't have my heart broken. This is no TFIOS. But it's real and it's perfect.Another thing I love is when authors turn out to be huge Potterheads. There is nothing I enjoy more than a good Harry Potter reference, or five.Find more of my books on Instagram", "\n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I hope that to you, too, it will not make any sense.Starr may only be sixteen, but she has already witnessed two murders in her life: the first of a young black girl in a drive by and the second of a young black boy shot multiple times by a cop.While she was in the car. Even though they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Even though he was unarmed. \n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nDoes that make any sense to you? You can\u2019t just kill someone because, to you, they look threatening. Are you a seer? Can you predict that they will reach for a gun and kill you with it? No, you cannot. (Even then it wouldn\u2019t be completely right.) You have no right to take an innocent life like that. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this important novel tackles issues of race in society involving the black community of people and authority figures, more precisely, police officers.Starr was never taught to fear cops, but she was taught to be smart around them. Do what they ask, even if what they ask for makes no sense.But because of what has happened to her childhood friend Khalil, she becomes scared. Scared enough to speak up about what she witnessed, though? Will she gather her courage to do what is right?\n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nThis story needed to be told. It has been told orally and on paper many times before, unfortunately, but it was time someone wrote a book dealing with social issues of race like the ones here for a young audience.For young people are dying. Young black people. Black boys. Black girls.This novel educates. It may be fictional in the sense that Angie Thomas created this story using fictional characters, but what happens in it is scary real. It does feel like it was written for white folks, but it sure as hell didn\u2019t need to be written for black ones specifically. \n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nBlog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "This was such a heartbreakingly honest account of what is happening in America right now. As a white reader, the experience this story affords its readers cannot be taken for granted. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this book takes you into the heart of Garden Heights after the main character has witnessed the wrongful murder of her best friend Khalil by a police officers. Being Canadian, as well as being white, I have the privilege of not having to deal with any of the things Starr deals with on a day to day basis but the experience of being alongside her as she grappled with the injustice of it all gave me a completely new understanding of what is going on in America. Canada has it's fair share of race issues as well and I obviously am not ignorant to it all, but this just felt like an honest firsthand account. It really is indescribable.

Highly, highly recommend.\n", "\nPrivilege is invisible to those who have it\n", "I don\u2019t know if I can say anything about this book that hasn\u2019t been said before, and better.Sometimes, a book transcends the typical criteria for a rating or review. It\u2019s not the plot, or prose, or characters that count, but the story itself. The sheer significance of the work negates any need to dwell on the details that tend to make a book what it is.This is the best example of that phenomenon I can think of.This is a story of unreal importance that came out exactly when it was needed and made its way into the hands of exactly the millions of people who would be most impacted by reading it. This is a story of unbearable suffering and injustice happening right now, and it was devoured by millions upon millions of young people.I can\u2019t wrap my mind around readers and reviews of this book who choose to get caught up in moments of uneven prose or slightly stilted characters. How could you decide to focus on such inanities considering everything that surrounds them?The Hate U Give examined one of the most important movements happening today, wrapped it up in a narrative, and gifted it to the young people of the world. That gift became one of the bestselling novels in recent memory.What could matter more than that?That\u2019s my bottom line.--------not even a tiny bit overhyped.review to come--------me: oh my god i'm so happy the hate u give won the goodreads choice awardme: wait i haven't even read the hate u giveme: ...wait it's not even on my shelvesme:", "It has taken me a long while to compose this review, because this book is the most powerful book I've ever read. It is important, educational, and happening in our world right now as you're reading this review. If you can only read one book in 2017, please pick this one. This book is inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter movement, where sixteen-year-old Starr witnesses her best friend, who is an unarmed black boy, be killed by a police officer. Starr is scared to speak up, constantly battling what to do, because there is never any justice for these heartless killings. This book is real, honest, and it's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, but being uncomfortable is necessary to change. And this book is going to change a lot of people's lives. I hope everyone reads this and starts educating themselves on, and will stop ignoring, the problems going on in today's world. Books are the most powerful and influential tool we have, and The Hate U Give is a literary masterpiece that will be a constant reference for years to come. \n\n\u201cThat's the problem. We let people say stuff, and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201d\n\n\nImportant things that I want to say: \n\u2022 Reverse racism doesn't exist. \u2022 White people will never know what it feels like to be a marginalized black person who is still being oppressed in 2017. You might think you do, but you don't. \u2022 When you say #AllLivesMatter, even when coming from a place of good, it is hurtful and ignoring the greater problems that are prevalent. \u2022 When you say #BlueLivesMatter it actually makes me feel sick to my stomach, especially after reading this book. Stop doing this. I don't care if your dad is \"one of the good cops out there\"; it is disrespectful for this plague of an epidemic that is happening to our black men and women. \u2022 I can do better and I can do more. We can do better and we can all do more.\u2022 Here is a list of some unarmed black men that have been killed over the past few years by the police brutality that is ever growing in the United States: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Dontre Hamilton, Eric Garner, John Crawford III, Michael Brown Jr., Michael Brown Jr., Dante Parker, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Jerame Reid, Tony Robinson, Phillip White, Eric Harris, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Keith Lamont Scott, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, and more that go unnamed and unanswered every day. Remember these names. Honor these names. Open your eyes. See what is going on in our world and see how wrong it is. It is easy to ignore when it is not happening to you, but is this really the kind of world you want to live in? Open your heart; be empathetic to your fellow human. Let's change this, and have The Hate U Give be the first stepping stone. \n\n\u201cYou can destroy wood and brick, but you can't destroy a movement.\u201d\n\nThank you, Angie Thomas; I truly hope your book changes this world. Lastly, I want to emphasize that this review is coming to you from a young, white, immensely privileged woman. These are five amazing people of color giving amazing heartfelt reviews on YouTube that showcases why this book is the most important and influential book of our time. Here are a few of the people we should need to be listening to:\u2022 BooksAndBigHair\u2022 TheBookArcher\u2022 Lily Meade\u2022 iLivieforbooks\u2022 the (book) supplierBlog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch ", "4.5/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3a\n\u201cAt an early age I learned that people make mistakes, and you have to decide if their mistakes are bigger than your love for them.\u201d\nCONFESSION: I saw this book, I liked its cover, but when I read the synopsis I was like \u201c\u2026uhm\u2026I don\u2019t really think this is my type of book\u201d. But I added it to my TBR pile and forgot about its existence.But here we are now.\nThe Hate U Give.\n That stands for THUG, right? Well, it does because Tupac said so.The book revolves around Tupac\u2019s motto: THUG LIFE \u2013 The Hate U Give Little Infants F-s Everyone.It might sound too \u201cghetto\u201d or it might sound completely bullshit. To some people. But it is actually deeper than ignorant people can handle. It is the rough way of saying that hate is given to people from infancy. This hate grows and evolves into something that can affect everyone. No one is safe when raised with hate. No one.\n\u201cI can\u2019t change where I come from or what I\u2019ve been through, so why should I be ashamed of what makes me, me?\u201d\nStarr is only sixteen and she\u2019s already lost two of her best friends \u2013 one at ten and the other at sixteen. For the last one, she was the only witness at his brutal murder.From the outside, whatever happens in the hood is cruel and dangerous. People from the outside label those who live in the ghetto, but they never hear their backstories. No one cares about those backstories. And this is why Khalil\u2019s murder is not being validated. Because he\u2019s been labelled as a drug dealer, gang member\u2026a young thug. And not as the boy who loved his Mama more than he loved himself. Or the boy who loves bubble baths. Or the boy who tried to sacrifice everything for his family.\n\u201cHe was more than any bad decision he made.\u201d\nThis is a book about standing straight in from of the unfairness of life and shouting for your freedom. It\u2019s about the racism, the violence, the abuse and the punishment some get and others don\u2019t.Now, I really want to say that I love Starr\u2019s family.They annoy the hell out of each other but they love each other and they always put family first. They know how to protect one another and they are going to do so under any circumstance.Their love and affection for each other made my heart cry.Also, even though Nana wasn\u2019t really the best mum for her children when she was younger, she was a hell of a character throughout the book! Like for real, every passage of the book containing even the least reference to that woman made me laugh. She\u2019s hysterically sassy!And since we are here, Nana was also the one that said that when it rains while the sun\u2019s out, that means that the devil is beating his wife. Putting aside the domestic violence that this belief leads to (that I am really not approving of and I think it should be abolished), this is actually more of an accurate saying than we have in Romanian. Because, we also have this in Romanian (because we have a hell of an imagination and we somehow believe in everything the folklore says but also we don\u2019t, just because).Take every single child in Romania outside while is raining when the sun is out and they're going to tell you that it is \u201ccat\u2019s wedding\u201d. What the bloody hell does that mean, we don\u2019t know, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from saying it. I am not looking for masterpieces in general when I read books. I don\u2019t think all books should be masterpieces. Some of them ought to be fun. Some ought to inspire. And that is the beauty of them all.Drawing now a line, I have decided that this book was not meant to be a literary masterpiece. No. It was created to raise awareness of various factors that are real and alive. And that I why I salute this book with almost 5 full stars. It\u2019s worth my stars because it was worth my time. \n\u201cDon\u2019t let them put words in your mouth. God gave you a brain. You don\u2019t need theirs.\u201d\nSpeak up your mind. Dare to be you in a world everyone wants you to be something else. Find your voice to fight everything that doesn\u2019t seem right to you.

If you are considering reading this one, listen to it. You wont regret it.\n", "Wow. Just wow.In my life so far, I've had the opportunity to experience many different things, but there are certain things I'll never get/have to experience. For example, I'll never experience childbirth, not that I'm complaining, although I once had a cortisone shot in my hip flexor, and my orthopedist said she thought those hurt just as badly. (You can debate on that.)I'm also fortunate enough that I'll never have to worry about the police viewing me as a threat as soon as they see me, just because of the color of my skin. I'll never have to think about the possibility of a routine traffic stop turning into something more dangerous just because a policeman gets nervous. That's something I take for granted, but I won't now that I've read Angie Thomas' searing, powerfully moving \nThe Hate U Give\n.Starr is 16 years old. She feels like there are two of her\u2014the devoted daughter who lives in a poor neighborhood and saw her best friend get killed in a drive-by shooting when they were 10, and the student at the fancy prep school her parents sent her and her brothers to in order to get them out of the ghetto, the student who doesn't speak the way she does at home, and lets very few people into her \"real world.\" Even her boyfriend at school, Chris, with whom she watches reruns of \nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n doesn't know the \"real\" Starr, although he says he wants to.\"Funny how it works with white kids though. It's dope to be black until it's hard to be black.\"One night while Starr is at a party in her neighborhood, she runs into her childhood friend Khalil. Khalil was her first crush, and although she hasn't seen him for a while, it feels good to reconnect. When a fight breaks out at the party, the two leave before things get out of hand. Not long afterward, police pull Khalil's car over, and before they know it, Khalil gets shot and killed by the cop. He was unarmed.Khalil's death throws Starr and her family into a tailspin. The media has already branded Khalil a drug dealer and a thug. Starr doesn't feel like she can tell her friends at school what happened because that would be exposing them to a part of her she has tried to keep hidden, but she is angered by the attitude of one of her friends toward Khalil's shooting. Starr is afraid of the ramifications of telling the truth of what happened that night to police, prosecutors, everyone\u2014what if police target her family? What if others think she should just keep her mouth shut? And will speaking up make the difference anyway, if most of the time white cops don't pay the price for shooting black people?\"I've tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down. Now I am that person, and I'm too afraid to speak.\"Starr's involvement in Khalil's death uncovers friction in a number of places\u2014between her parents, who argue about the merits of getting their family out of their neighborhood versus their responsibility to making sure it doesn't die; between her father and his nemesis, the leader of a powerful gang, who is intertwined with Starr's family in too many different ways; between her and Chris, as well as her friends at school; and between the factions of their neighborhood and others in the community, some who riot for the sake of rioting and don't care what destruction they cause, and some who understand the power of their actions.\nThe Hate U Give\n is tremendously moving and just so current given what is happening in our society. While certainly it focuses on police brutality and the anger minorities feel when the authorities don't get punished for doing wrong, it is quick to point out that not all police are bad, just as not all black people are drug dealers, gang members, or looking to do harm. This is a book about racism, but it's also a book about family, friendship, loyalty, community, and how often it truly does take a village to save someone. This is a book that addresses the plight that many young black men face, but it doesn't place the blame on anyone but them, either.I thought Thomas did a great job with this book, making sure it wasn't too heavy-handed in its messaging or too extreme in its plot. She created characters you grew to care about, characters you were invested in, so when pivotal events occurred, you were moved by them. This really blew my mind, and I think this is a book which really deserves all of the hype it is getting.Several times in the book Starr's mother uttered the quote, \"Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.\" I hope \nThe Hate U Give\n reaches those despairing whether doing the right thing is still worth it even if it doesn't get the result they want. Because it really, truly is.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo....", "This has got to be one of the most hyped books in the existence of YA evers. And you know what? It is 5000% WORTHY of that hype and more and basically get thee to this book and read it as soon as possible. It perfectly combines a really important story about #BlackLivesMatter and speaking up for it with absolutely excellent writing and storytelling. Like, dude, this book is important and one of the best contemporaries.So I have to admit: the character are what makes it that just something incredibly special for me. Starr was SO winning and rootable (shh that's a word) and I loved how she was so complex and had such personality and was so honestly relatable. And then the book focuses SO much on family!! Be still my beating heart. <3 I looooove books about family and Starr has the kind of parents YA is in desperate need of: in love, supportive, respectful of each other, and bringing their kids up the best they can be. LIKE HOLD ME I'M FLAILING. (Also it was really refreshing to have teens that respect their parents...because I can't tell you how sick I am of how many books I encounter were the kids are just selfish disrespectful jellyfish. That wasn't how I was brought up so it's like nice to see kids who can talk to their parents about anything, LOVE THEM FIERCELY, and also do not dare muck up too bad or they'll get in huge trouble. I love it.) Basically Starr calls her parents her OTP and....dude yes.I also absolutely adored all the secondary characters. Like they were ALL so real and complex?!?? It wasn't like \"oh here I am reading a piece of paper\". More like \"oh here I am being with these humans who are like totally alive to me\". SO THAT'S INCREDIBLE. A+ for writing at every corner basically. And I absolutely adored Starr's older brother Seven, and Sekani the younger bro was adorable too although entirely annoying...as younger siblings are. And then Starr had an epic Asian friend (and also a racist friend whom we all want to kind of smack into the middle of next week...that gets dealt with tho). And even DeVante was just adorable and I love how his story line went.Oh oh see this is the thing?!?? EVERY character had their own storyline. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. And that's why this book is so good and the story so real.OTHER LIST OF THINGS I LOVED:\u2022 Starr has friends who are women, like god bless, this shouldn't be irregular but it is in a lot of books\u2022 there is SO MUCH FOOOOOOOOOD\u2022 Starr has a super sweet relationship with her uncle as well\u2022 It's funny!! It's such a serious story line but there are still quips and TONS of time where I was grinning like a dork\u2022 It's #ownvoices\u2022 It's unfair but it also shines light into the world, so I feel sad but GOOD finishing it and I think it just sent an excellent message in a really hopeful wayI do have to admit two things were not my favourite. And that would be (1) it's very long...I have yet to meet a contemporary that is nearly 500 pages that I think should be that long. Erm, SORRY. Concise = my friend. And (2) I didn't feel very much chemistry AT ALL between Starr and her white boyfriend, Chris. They both seemed to be a bit of a problem to each other. But ya know, it's a sweet romance and I didn't not ship it, I just think it was definitely the weakest part of the book. (view spoiler)[Especially since basically every second scene with them Starr was having an issue with Chris being white. I am white so obviously I don't want to say anything ignorant here. I think Chris was trying?? But then he also said dumb stuff too that Starr corrected him on and he took it...so that was great! I think the calling out was ALWAYS well done and needed in this book. I just can't see these two staying together??? But I hope they do!! (hide spoiler)]Also I really learnt a lot about the #BlackLivesMatter movement. It was really good to just be reading this and knowing it's #ownvoices and just taking it all in. The horror that is the justice system is so sickening. And I was so scared for everyone's lives and just knowing HOW REAL THIS IS made an impact. No one should have a friend die in front of them, and Starr has it happen twice. It's heartbreaking. This is such an important book. It tackles racism and police violence and the corrupt justice system head on.ALL IN ALL: go read it, obviously. I mean, what else is there to say?!?? The writing is beautiful and incredible, there are so many perfect sentences that I was underlining in my kindle, and I loved Starr and her incredibly family so much. <3 It's a SAD book but also a HOPEFUL one.(And mate, I'm a fantasy reader addict, so look at me go, loving a contemporary so much.)*** QUOTES ***Note: these are taken from an ARC so don't use them anywhere! They might not be the final edits!\"Brave doesn't mean you're not scared, Starr,\" she says. \"It means you go on even though you're scared. And you're doing that.\"\"So she unfollowed your Tumblr thingy,\" Momma says, proving why she can never have one.I feel like shit right now. I can't believe I let Hailey say that. Or has she always joked like that? Did I always laugh because I thought I had to?That's the problem. We let people say stuff, and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?Funny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black people's lives too. Saving them from their \"wild African ways\". Same shit, different century. I wish people like them would stop thinking that people like me need saving.\"Daddy, you're the worst person to watch Harry Potter with.

My typical days are like boot camp lately -walking between 7-10 miles a day -PLUS an hour circuit weight resistance class ( 4 mile walk to class from my house) -- then I often walk to a cafe - eat & drink something - check-in with Goodreads -- try to touch base with this community- a few 'one-on- one' chatting exchanges--during my sitting break.Sometimes I try to talk into the phone while I walk. Typos exposed! Before walking to my weight residence class - I'm often at the gym at 5 AM-- a few weights & stretching to begin - then an hour to 90 minutes of cardio 'while' reading from my paper white - BEFORE THAT....I've read in bed a few hours 'before' the gym....Exhausted yet? For relaxation-- I've added back an OLD FARTS YOGA CLASS.....AN EASY CLASS .... much too easy for me --but it's perfect! The breathing alone and time for inner blessings -private time to experience being 'one' with the world - hoping to be a better person, is worth the extra time spent in class. I send out blessings to family & friends while I'm in my own space on my own yoga mat. ( very private & personal but real for me).... Why am I sharing this? I retired from traditional reviews--- but I may write a few NON- TRADITIONAL REVIEWS as my way to feel connected with people here I love and am forever thankful for!!! After receiving the crappy diagnosis of osteoporosis on July 3rd this year --I knew I had to make changes. Take the yucky medication - and not fight it.. GET THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CALCIUM in my diet not under-eat... and get out of the chair. Writing reviews that take an hour or more won't build bone density. So-- I started downloading as many audiobooks I could get my hands on - free- from the library overdrive. I paid for a few too. Getting ready for walking- moving daily boot camp - reading included. When I finished \"The Hate U Give\".... taking my turn at this book, which I recommend everyone take THEIR TURN, ....I still had about 1 more mile walk home. I was DYING TO CONNECT WITH MY DAUGHTERS. This book did that to me. So.... HOW DOES A MOM CONNECT WITH THEIR ADULT KIDS WHEN THEY ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY - and they can't talk at the moment? Perfect solution: play music that reminds you of them!!!So-- I immediately listen to Aerosmith, \"Don't Want to Miss A Thing\", from Armageddon---Ali insisted on playing that song as her 'opening song' at her Bat Mitzvah.....nothing Jewish about it!- and we have a luv/thing with Aerosmith together. For Katy - I played \"Someone Else's Story\" from the Broadway Musical \"Chess\". It's such a beautiful song ( listen to it). Katy use to sing it often! She always brings tears to my eyes when she sings it. Her voice is beautiful. And how does ANY OF THIS RELATE TO \"The Hate You Give\"? I have no idea ....other than all these emotions - thoughts & feelings ARE ASSOCIATED with THIS BOOK.Somehow they are all tied together!!!!I'll leave you with one sentence in this book that - for me - represents the context of this beautiful- heartbreaking story.  \"A Good Garden Needs A Good Conversation\". 5 Strong stars!!! I vote the audiobook!", "When you read a 444 page book in one day bc you can\u2019t put it down. Powerful. Yeah, I don\u2019t think I can write a review for this one other than to say everyone (of a certain age/maturity) should read this. Poignant, important and timely. ", "congratulations, 2017 goodreads choice winner in both best YA fiction AND best debut goodreads author!!i rarely read realistic YA - if i\u2019m going to read YA, i prefer fantasy or survival stuff where teens are in peril. but this was recommended to me by too many people to put aside \"for later,\u201d and while there are plenty of teens in peril, this sure ain\u2019t fantasy. it earns every one of its rave reviews; it\u2019s an important, timely book that doesn\u2019t feel as though it was thrown together in order to cash in on its timeliness. something like this could\u2019ve easily skewed exploitative or preachy, and it doesn\u2019t. at all. this was not thrown together, this was crafted. the voice is there, the emotional depth is there, it\u2019s got strata for days, and its adaptation potential is a no-brainer - the family and neighborhood warmth-with-warts of spike lee (and my heart recognizes none but delroy lindo as maverick carter), and the focus of kids caught up in/on the outskirts of the game of the wire with a female gaze both of those (largely) lack. it\u2019s smart, occasionally subtle food for thought with plenty of appeal for adult readers. i\u2019d go on, but i\u2019m so late to reading this, i\u2019m just one more admiring voice in a sea of positive response, and if you are even later than me, reading my garbage-words is just keeping you from reading this, and that\u2019s no good.two thumbs down for that prom scene, but everything else is gold.come to my blog!", "\"We are with you not against youWe only hope you got the common sense toRealize we're unifiedAnd realize we are here to back youAnd not let anybody else attack youSo you know we're on your sideWe're unified\"The Mighty Mighty BosstonesThe Hate That U Give is an important story about humanity. As much as we think life is \"us against them\" it is really \"us against us\". Across all races there are good and bad people, wise and reckless decisions are made, opinions formulated, etc. But, in the end, there is not much difference between all of us.This book does a great job of opening the discussion with fairness and open-mindedness. While the setting was inner city in the midst of racial tensions, the book was well written to be accessable to all readers. This is awesome because I think all people should give this story a try. Even if you don't care for YA or worry the subject matter might make you uncomfortable (in which case, you probably need a little uncomfortableness in your life) you should still give it a go.I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was fantastic. If you tend to prefer audio or are thinking of reading this and wonder which format to try, the audio is definitely worth it. Bahni Turpin gives Angie Thomas' already lively dialogue an extra bump of passion with superb delivery and characterization.Again, we all live together on this planet and there will not be enough room for us if we continue to let the hate between us grow. This book not only shows what happens if the hate grows, but also what happens when we work together to overcome it.", "Wow. This book was phenomenal. it completely lived up to the hype. I have a lot of thoughts on this so here they are (keep in mind this is coming from an Asian American from the Bay Area):I loved how educational it was. It really made you understand the Black Lives Matter movement and the reality of it. It hit every single point and put you right in the middle of it.I also liked how Angie Thomas made brought up big points in really subtle ways. For example, \u201cFunny how it works with white kids though. It\u2019s dope to be black until it\u2019s hard to be black\u201d (11). That is so true. People only like black culture when it\u2019s cool , but the minute something bad happens to the black community, they distance themselves from it. But the quote that really hit hard was, \u201cFunny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black people\u2019s lives too. Saving them from their \u2018wild African ways.\u2019 Same Shit, different century. I wish people them would stop thinking that people like me need saving\u201d (246). I read that quote and was like, damn, preach it girl! The minority alliance between Starr and Maya made me so happy. It was so good to see a black girl and her Asian best friend team up. Angie Thomas could have done a bit more with it, but it was still nice to see it included. Personally, I think we need more minority alliances because there is more that unites us than divides us and together we can make a big impact. #Asians4BlackLives I also liked that this tackled interracial dating. It added an extra layer to the complexity of this novel. The pop culture references were a really nice and unexpected touch. I was definitely not expecting High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers to be mentioned in this book. Overall, this book was everything. It should be taught in schools because despite being fiction, it was so informative, thought provoking, and leaves the door open for a lot of discussion.", "What can you say when you've read the book of the year, and one of the books of the decade? That's what most people would say. I am going by the consensus. Personally, I didn't think this book is a masterpeice. I still don't, after some headscratching. This book is good, but is it 'To Kill a Mockingbird' good?I don't think so. There are some glitches in the book. There is an unnecessary mystery, where for the most part we don't know what really happened to Starr's friend. But as you see, I gave the book 4 stars. I might be the only one of my friends to give it such a low score. But the thing the author does best is conflict. That shows, because my review sure is conflicted.Ignorance and violence go hand in hand. I know I'm writing a book review and not giving a speech on my soapbox, but I gained a lot of details that cannot be totally fictitious, given what I've been seeing in the U.S. currently. The book touches on the society, the family, the education system, the media, the politics, and yes, the police, too.There are other good things to say about this book. The throwback to the Civil Rights movements cannot be missed. Sadly, but grimly, these issues are still pertinent in the U.S.A. I live in another country, so for The Hate U Give to make me part of this struggle for enlightenment, is an acheivement and a blessing.I thought that Angie Thomas's style is a patchwork pastiche one. You can see the influence. You can hear the echo from previous books. This is, surprisingly, a very enjoyable read. But it's not the game changing, earth shattering book that every one has been raving about. The tension, the twists, the pauses, the resolutions, all of these left me content. But I didn't cry or something near that. I will definitely read the author's next book, that's for sure though.", "After reading this book, I can certainly see what all the uproar is about. 'The Hate U Give' addresses the very sensitive issues of race relations and police brutality in a time when the nation is torn over these issues. Most of my friends are at one extreme or the other when it comes to the #Blacklivesmatter movement. Since I don't want to incite an online mobbing, I'm going to do my best to avoid that movement specifically, while sharing my thoughts and opinions on this wonderful book.First of all, this is a very moving story. It centers on a teenage black girl, Starr Carter, who leaves her crime-riddled neighborhood each day to attend an affluent school across town. In both settings, she feels a need to conform to the social norms. This means that she lives a double-life of sorts -- she has one persona with her black family and friends in her neighborhood and another one with her wealthy, predominantly white, friends from her school. One night she attends a party in her neighborhood that turns violent. After leaving the party with her childhood friend, Khalil, her life and her community is forever changed. A routine traffic stop turns tragic when an unarmed Khalil is repeatedly shot by a police officer after failing to follow police instructions. The events of that night serve as the spark that sets off an explosion. Starr's neighborhood has a long-standing animosity for the police, citing multiple instances of police brutality and harassment. The death of Khalil is only the latest in a long line of atrocities.Begrudgingly, Starr is forced into the center of a media feeding frenzy. Part of her wishes that she could just hide and return to her \"old\" life, while another part wants to be brave and stand up for what she believes is right. She was in an extremely difficult situation for a young girl. Although she initially tries to remain anonymous, as the sole witness of Khalil's murder she eventually speaks out publicly. Doing so, Starr learns a lot about herself and the people that she surrounds herself with. Some will stick around to support her, others will reveal that they were never really who she thought they were.While this book certainly highlighted the issue of police brutality against blacks, there were several other takeaways for me. I applaud the author for not shying away from other issues that are controversial. For example, racism - against multiple races - was prevalent throughout this story. I appreciated that the author was forthcoming in addressing this topic, even knowing that it would likely be controversial. Two wrongs don't make a right. Racism is still racism and it is wrong, regardless of the race.Although I did find the danger of Starr's neighborhood to be exaggerated, the author also highlighted the issue of violent crime, drugs and gang warfare. Several times, there were drive-by shootings or other crimes committed in Starr's neighborhood by the residents against the residents. It was sad and the author did a good job of highlighting this issue/cycle of violence. One notable, older man in the story commented on this and I couldn't have agreed with him more. There was a lot of senseless violence and crime in Starr's neighborhood. As he said, the government needn't look further than that neighborhood to find a real terrorist. The people lived in fear, not only of the police, but of the crime lord in their midst.The conflict in Starr's family over whether to stay in the neighborhood, despite the danger, or move to a safer neighborhood, also was enlightening. There were a lot of mixed feelings and a sense of betrayal that accompanied her parent's desire to \"better\" their situation and that of their children. It reminded me of that saying about crabs in a bucket, always trying to pull one back in before they can get out. There was certainly plenty of pressure and resentment, both within and outside of her family where this was concerned. They had to balance their desire to improve their situation against the repercussions of being viewed as sell-outs. The same was true for Starr's uncle, who was a police officer.Overall, this was a wonderful book. I'd definitely recommend it to others, regardless of their views. It provides plenty of food for thought and raises awareness of several important social issues. ", "Wow, talk about a book that can hit you with every emotion possible. Starr's character was so well written that every time she had to interact with her high school friends I cringed at their responses. This is an incredibly powerful book, not just for its political message but for the internal conflict Starr is struggling with. The story was so much deeper than that initial conflict, it really dug into who Starr is and why she feels guilty even though the reader is screaming at the pages \"You have nothing to feel badly about! You did nothing wrong!\"Though I know there are other authors out there with stories like this to tell, it's so great to see this sort of coming of age story receive the commercial success it has. I wish Angie Thomas nothing but success and good fortune in all her future endeavors.", "\nMore like a 4.5 :).I loved this book so much. It made me see things from a different perspective. It educated me.\n", "For all the white people who said this book was racist, let me tell you one thing : racism was invented by white people. You can feel prejudiced or discriminated against, but don\u2019t call it racism.I\u2019m a biracial person - hi my dad\u2019s family\u2019s from Vietnam. And as a biracial person I found this book quite hard to read sometimes mostly because of all the comments on interracial relationships. But now again, the way I have to deal with racism isn\u2019t the same way Black people have to deal with it, so obviously the way I react to this book won\u2019t be the same as Black people do. So yes, I see - but still condemn - why white people - mostly - weren\u2019t happy about some subjects of this book, but then again guys, this book isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s not about how you feel about the BLM movement, not about how you feel \u2018insulted\u2019 by a Black man saying he doesn\u2019t trust White people, it\u2019s about what White racist people created throughout the years. YES I felt uncomfortable while reading the comments about interracial relationships in this book but YES I realize it has nothing to do with me - because this book isn\u2019t about my culture - and YES if a Black person tells you you\u2019re being racist you have every right - you\u2019re even encouraged - to shut the hell up because I think they know what racism looks like.Also, to everybody who says racism isn\u2019t a thing anymore \u2026. how dare you ? How dare you ?! Racism is everywhere, I don\u2019t care if you believe it or not, but it is. Racism is taught to us from kindergarten, when someone makes fun of somebody else\u2019s accent, of someone else\u2019s culture, it\u2019s EVERYWHERE so stop saying it doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It does. And people are killed in the name of racism, and they never get the justice they deserve, because YES racism is still a thing, even nowadays in our so called \u2018advanced society\u2019. Racism, racism, racism, RACISM. Get used to this word because it\u2019s a reality for a lot of us.And this book shows exactly what I\u2019m talking about, and I was mad while reading it because it hurts to see some people are still so blind, and ignorant, and mean.I also would like to talk about something, because if you don\u2019t know this I\u2019m French and policemen in my country don\u2019t have guns, so I\u2019m not all that familiar - and I\u2019m grateful - with people being killed because they\u2019re people of colour. But unfortunately we\u2019re familiar with people being beaten up sometimes for NOTHING but the medias will always find something to defend the cops who did something wrong. Every single time. If an innocent man gets punched or worse by a policeman, I don\u2019t give a fuck if he sells drugs or anything else, I just don\u2019t care, but what I care about is that this man is basically being told that it\u2019s his fault if the policeman reacted this way. And in this book people say it\u2019s okay if Khalil\u2019s dead because he\u2019s a drug dealer and he would have died anyway \u2026 but in what world do we live ? People get MURDERED on assumptions and then it\u2019s their fault ? How the fuck does this sound right to you ?This book is EXTREMELY important. If you think it\u2019s overhyped, then it means there is a problem with you, because this book isn\u2019t. This book is about the truth, the ugly truth. And I liked that it\u2019s explicitly said that all cops aren\u2019t bad cops, all cops aren\u2019t like the one who killed Khalil, because that is important to remember. And the interracial couple was well done. Yes Chris and Starr were cute, but that wasn\u2019t just that. Chris is respectful, he doesn\u2019t try to \u2018steal\u2019 Starr\u2019s culture, but he does everything to understand her and learn from his mistakes. And so does Starr.It would be so easy to quit if it was just about me, Khalil, that night, and that cop. It's about way more than that though. It's about Seven. Sekani. Kenya. DeVante.It's also about Oscar.Aiyana.Trayvon.Rekia.Michael.Eric.Tamir.John.Ezell.Sandra.Freddie.Alton.Philando.It's even about this little boy in 1955 who nobody recognized at first - Emmett.The messed-up part ? There are so many more.Yet I think it'll change one day. How ? I don't know. When ? I definitely don't know. Why ? Because there will always be someone ready to fight. Maybe it's my turn.Around the Year in 52 books 2017.11. A category from another challenge.From the Diversity Bingo Challenge 2017 - POC ON THE COVER.", "UPDATE DEC 4/5, 2017Yesterday I found out that this book has been banned in a Texas school district (Katy ISD). And honestly??? I\u2019m so angry right now. Y\u2019all probably don\u2019t know this, but I was born and currently live in Texas (hence my use of the word \u201cy\u2019all\u201d), so I\u2019m just extremely!! frustrated!! with the state I call \u201chome\u201d!!!!The hypothetical reasons for this ban are really, truly, insanely stupid. They say that it might be because of sexual content\u2015sex was literally mentioned only TWICE in this book!!! And I\u2019m sure that some books in Katy ISD\u2019s library have more sexual content than this!!! They also say that it might be because of language, and yeah, THUG has a lot of swear words. But again, I\u2019m sure that there are some books in school libraries with just as much language as THUG, and perhaps even more.The last reason is just so SO stupid that I can literally feel my face turning red with anger: The book is banned because of its heavy topics of police brutality. Okay, yeah, it makes total sense for a school library to ban a book that is educating people about issues going on in the country they live in!!!When I read this book, my eyes were opened. Of course I knew that police brutality was happening in America; I just didn\u2019t really grasp its extent. I can\u2019t believe that a school district is banning people\u2019s right to read a book so incredibly important in today\u2019s world, that talks of issues happening RIGHT NOW and need to be addressed. Every student in Katy ISD is being denied this book from their school libraries, when they have every right to be allowed to read it, ESPECIALLY because of the topics that it handles.A school district should be working towards educating their students in a way that they will grow up to be people who will want to change the world for the better, and banning THUG isn\u2019t going to achieve that. The subjects discussed in this book are so so important, and I honestly cannot believe that someone had the audacity to ban such an influential book. They are smothering the voices of almost 3 million black Texans, 45 million black Americans, all because the topics are [raises voice to a whine] \u201ctoo heavy\u201d.Banning a book does not make the truth any less real, nor any less uncomfortable; it only makes you ignorant.\u201cTexas, o Texas, all hail the mighty state\u201d?? No thanks.P.S. As a form of protest of this stupid ban, you can enter \nHERE\n to win 20 copies of THUG for your library or school of choice!!! (US only)ORIGINAL REVIEW-------------------------4.5 stars.This is a book that everyone needs to read. No matter what race you are, this is just SUCH an important book, and if there\u2019s one book that needs to be assigned to all school reading, it\u2019s this one. It has been a New York Times bestseller for MONTHS, and all for good reason.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK\n\n\u25cf It has such an important message. The Hate U Give talks about police brutality in America, and how white policemen are shooting innocent, unarmed black men. It offers a view point from Starr Carter, who witnessed her black friend Khalil\u2019s death at the hands of a white police man.\u25cf It is just so eye-opening. Many people know about this issue. But THUG allows you to perceive the story from a personal viewpoint. It opens your eyes to how some black people are living because of stereotypes and discriminations\u2014and often, they\u2019re not the best lives. Starr has a unique perspective, being from a black neighborhood in a white school, and witnessing racism at its worst, and it just is so enlightening to see this.\u25cf I live in America, and while I knew that incidents like this were happening, I didn\u2019t think it was to this extent. I was clueless and oblivious and blind. So for me to read this book and realize the horrors that are going on in my country\u2026 it was shocking. But that\u2019s just another reason why you HAVE to read this book. Because it truly opens your eyes to how far racism towards black people go in America.\u25cf It is so true and realistic. I honestly almost cried several times because of how unfair and unjust the discrimination was. I got so so frustrated?? Not with the book, but with the world\u2014of how something this inhumane and horrifying can happen, and is happening. I\u2019m not even kidding, it was EXTREME frustration, as in I-want-to-throw-this-book-across-the-room-but-I-won\u2019t-because-it\u2019s-a-book frustration, and if a book can make you feel deep emotions like that, you know it\u2019s good. (My BR partner also was frustrated many times, so you know it\u2019s not just me!)\u25cf It\u2019s written\u2026 beautifully?? I don\u2019t know, I just find Angie Thomas\u2019 writing style so easy to read and honest and raw. Or maybe it\u2019s just Starr\u2019s voice. Whatever it is, the book was just super enjoyable to read, which helped balance out the fact that the topic it was talking about was so HEAVY.\u25cf The characters are amazing!! Starr is so precious and I just love her. Even tho she wants people to speak up when they witness things like she did, she just can\u2019t find the courage to do it herself. That fear makes her so realistic and relatable and you just root for her the entire book. Her family is JUST as amazing, too. They all have such great relationships with each other\u2014they may have their rough spots but they love each other (and it\u2019s great to see such good family dynamics in YA).\u25cf The pacing is A+. Usually I have lots of problems with the pacing of contemporaries, but this was just perfect. Although I do feel like some of the novel could be cut out because it was so long, I understand that this novel was meant to be very character-focused.\u25cf The ending is just beautiful. It\u2019s not exactly the (view spoiler)[happiest ending, but it is the most realistic, and that\u2019s just what Angie is trying to portray. She presents unfairness and leads you to think of how absolutely HORRIBLE it is\u2026 and then reveals that you don\u2019t get justice. It\u2019s worse in real life, and I think it\u2019s such an honest and perfect way to end this book. (hide spoiler)] WHY IT WASN\u2019T A PERFECT BOOK// Racism is a really touchy subject (and personal to me, as I\u2019ve experienced it before as a POC\u2014though not as extreme as in this book), and these are all just my opinions!!\u25cf There was discrimination against white people. This book is trying to promote being kind and supportive of each other, and show how racism isn\u2019t making the world any better. [EDIT] Of course, prejudice and racism are different things, but I personally feel like the book was working to make people aware of black racism and prejudice.\u25cf Because of that, I found the message contradictory at times. HOWEVER, the prejudice towards the white characters definitely does not take away the importance & significance of the message. This also is something that happens in real life and I get that the author was trying to write the book as realistically as possible. I also realize that when Starr and her friends were making prejudiced jokes about whites, they were just that\u2014jokes. [END EDIT] It happens all the time in today\u2019s world, to all races. Even the white people make jokes about the black people in this book. But that still doesn\u2019t make it okay.\u25cf For me, something was lacking. It was an absolutely amazing read and so so powerful & important, but I just feel like something was off?? I really can\u2019t explain it\u2014I know it\u2019s not only me because my BR partner said something was missing for her too. That\u2019s literally the only reason why I knocked off half a star. This book has such high praise from everyone, and it\u2019s not for nothing. This truly is one of the most powerful YA books I\u2019ve ever read, and the message it has so inspiring. In a world today where so many people face racism\u2014even if it\u2019s in the form of a \u201cjoke\u201d\u2014this is a book that everyone needs to read. It is SO SO eye-opening and influential. I can\u2019t say it enough, god, just READ THE BOOK.// buddy read with the actual sweetest ever", "\n\u2018whats the point of having a voice if youre gonna be silent in those moments you shouldnt be?\u2019\nthis book is an important and necessary portrait of culture and community, as well as a much needed inspection of the injustice of racism and violence. its a hard-hitting story about a difficult subject which spares no courtesy in regards to the readers feelings. this book will make you uncomfortable and angry and sorrowful. it will make you re-evaluate how you see the world, others, and yourself. and it should be kept in mind that this is not only a work of fiction, but a common and real occurrence for so many people in the world today.this should be mandatory reading for everyone. \u21a0 4 stars", "While attending a Spring Break party, high schooler, Starr Carter, runs into her childhood best friend, Khalil.

That is illegal. This is illegal. Please stop writing illegal stuff.This book has made a great mess of my life. I keep thinking back to when I first read The Cruel Prince and how I was completely unaware of just how much this story would mean to me. My tiny human body isn\u2019t even big enough to hold all the love that\u2019s inside. I could fit a five bedroom house with a conservatory and a parking space in my heart, you can\u2019t even fathom this much love! In fact, it\u2019s now safe to assume that no matter what is happening at any given moment in time, the background noise going on in my heart is always love and appreciation for these books.\nSo what is this book about?\n\nHis mouth curls into a smile. His eyes shine with wicked intent. \n\u201cLook at them all, your subjects. A shame not a one knows who their true ruler is.\u201d\nThe veins of power are not, as the Faerieland of Elfham thinks, radiating out from the beating heart of their new High King. They are radiating out from his mortal seneschal: every thread of power and authority would start and end with Jude Duarte.Pulled under in a too-familiar poison current of enemies and allies (more of the former than the latter), Jude can\u2019t afford to betray the slightest amount of weakness or fear.\u00a0She must once again fight the battle of manners and politics and crowns that had traded blood-splattered hands quite often. She must learn to navigate the machinations of the court, the calculated plays for\u00a0power\u00a0and the truth of where thrones are won and lost\u2014in the favors traded for power, in the gossip and the letters passed in dark corners, in the secret payments and the shadow alliances.But with each day bringing her closer to the end of the deal she struck with Cardan\u2014where he vowed to act in accordance to her will for one year and a day and not one minute more\u2014a miasma of anxious fear hovers over everything as Jude begins to feel these new threads to the throne snap one by one, threatening to undo all her plans like a knot. And seeing as she and the High King are often at odds with each other, enemies as frequently as they are allies, Jude is left, as always, with her only thread of power: herself.\nPower is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any combination of words that could accurately convey just how good this book is. With a stage magician's flair for misdirection, Holly Black weaves a captivating spell with languorously descriptive writing\u2014the atmosphere was so vividly imagined I felt like moss would just start appearing around me, and branches would just grow from any surface I looked at\u2014breathtaking set pieces, engaging characters, and a gratifying emotional hook that will keep the pages whirring, ending this second installment with a spinning sense of history repeating itself and a cliffhanger that you might anticipate but only as a vague fear that might not come true if you didn\u2019t think about it too hard. The end will seem less of a synonym for ending than it will be for beginning as the characters learn the hard way just how slippery and illusory power is.\nTHE CHARACTERS:\n\ud83c\udf1fJUDE DUARTE:First of all, either you love Jude Duarte with all your heart or you get out of my car and walk home. Every time someone hates on Jude, my love for her only grows stronger. I can\u2019t prove this with science but when I was born, Sappho\u2019s spirit must have gently floated into my room and softly bopped my nose and that\u2019s why I am so gay for Jude.I am so fascinated by her character. I love her capacity for holding contradictory feelings in balance, for complexly alloyed affections, for stubborn bravery that seems more of a result of chaining her fears and not unhooking their leashes just yet, for bottomless generosity of heart with undertones of naked lust for power and petty, capricious malice. Jude is full of so many wants, too many to prioritize, and so sometimes, they all feel desperate. \u00a0She is a wolf learning the patterns of much bigger wolves.\u00a0She survived on the jagged edge of a cruel childhood. She let the fear act as a fuse to light her anger. She fought to claim the home that did not deign to claim her. She navigated an enemy court and made it her own. She secured her path to pure unfettered power when she should have been a captive. There's just such a flow and power to her that is so arresting to read about and I love it!\ud83c\udf1fCARDAN GREENBRIAR:Can you believe that Cardan exists and the only reason I too exist is to love him? If Cardan were real and alive in the 16th century, he would probably have been the muse of at least twenty different artists who would all fight for the right to paint and sculpt him because he\u2019s just that iconic.To put it simply: this book is just about a bunch of people having the worst day of their lives...and then there's Cardan, who is having the best day because of his tenacious commitment to be a layabout on a throne for which he sees none of the real work and all of the benefit. He spends most of his time lounging carelessly on his throne, his crown standing at an insouciant angle on his messy hair, a cold smile on his face and a glass of wine in his hand, essentially looking like a dreamy renaissance painting every day. And so, the important question remains: Siri, how do I infiltrate a fictional character\u2019s heart and make him fall in love with me?Look, I have a huge weakness for morally questionable characters who only seem like huge dicks because they have the social skills of an agoraphobic lobster, and not much pierces my heart right into my vulnerability like seeing these same characters emotionally flayed, with their skins off, exposing their fragmented, contradictory self to the reader.Cardan has spent most of his life being a soldier in a war where the enemy was everyone else. He\u2019d had one secret and he\u2019d kept it in a portion of his heart that no one had access to: that he was not truly loved and that it made him cruel. And when the delusion that he could earn his family\u2019s love by serving them wore out, and his passion dulled by the long, heavy wear of time and disappointment, the last of the armor he imagined his cruelty has given him had been stripped away and what remained was the undiluted, unedited and uncensored version of him. I can still hear the unmistakable sound of my heart breaking because I love this idiot so much and despite the things he\u2019s done, I just want him to be so happy that it outweighs all the sadness he\u2019s ever felt. [self-insert au fic where I adopt Cardan and raise him with the love and care he\u2019s always deserved]\ud83c\udf1fCARDAN AND JUDE (JURDAN?):\nOur eyes meet, and something dangerous sparks.He hates you, I remind myself.\u201cKiss me again,\u201d he says, drunk and foolish. \u201cKiss me until I am sick of it.\u201d\nI said this before and I'll say it again: Holly Black has done more for love with Jude & Cardan than Nicholas Sparks ever did. I\u00a0have a dozen hearts swirling around my head for them and that isn't a filter, it's permanent.I think the crux of this book was the emotional honesty between Jude and Cardan, as they begin to realize that if they want the reward of being truly\u00a0trusted, they must give in to the mortifying ordeal of being known. There are so many giant set pieces in this story, but nothing really propelled them along more than the authentic moments that happened between them. They know they\u2019re closer than they\u2019ve ever been and that becomes very integral to not just their relationship but to what happens at large for everyone in the story. They\u2019re aware of how much is riding on their ability to maintain this partnership and stay on the same level and not let anyone suspect that there\u2019s daylight between them because a lot of people would not hesitate to take advantage of that. Even when it was tempting for both of them to imagine how they could hurt the other, but only because it reminded them of how fiercely they could fall for each other.\u00a0\n  I really can't overstate how invested I am in this series. Jude and Cardan make me want to draw tiny hearts everywhere because I'm so full of love for them. This book was everything I wanted and more and with that cliffhanger,\u00a0I don't even want to think about what I'm going to do with my life until the release of the next book.\u2728 wishlist \u2728 blog \u2728 twitter \u2728 tumblr \u2728\n", "1.)

Spoiler: it\u2019s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn\u2019t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I\u2019m just that extra, but The Wicked King is perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I\u2019ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. But every time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I\u2019d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too. The Wicked King is the second installment in The Folk of the Air series, the first being my favorite book of 2017, The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So, please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled for The Cruel Prince!\n\n\u201cI want to tell you so many lies.\u201d\n\n(The most breathtaking fanart by Loweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is *clutches pearls forever* the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn\u2019t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them. \n\n\u201cPower is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.\u201d\n\nAnd everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase \u201ctwists and turns\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won\u2019t know who or what to believe, and you surely won\u2019t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page. And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren\u2019t wrong. You all thought The Cruel Prince cliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won\u2019t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I\u2019m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. Okay, I\u2019m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also, Roiben plays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it! (My favorite fanart(s) by PhantomRin!)\u27bd \n Jude Duarte\n - My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t know how I will ever want anything else.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Cardan Greenbriar\n - And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I\u2019m so sorry, neighbors, if you\u2019re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of \u201cbook boyfriends\u201d until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created. \u27bd \n Nicasia\n - I\u2019m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye. \u27bd \n Locke\n - Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I\u2019ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he\u2019s going to be the \u201cbig bad\u201d of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play. \n\n\u201cI wish he hadn\u2019t used me to test my sister\u2019s love for him. I wish she hadn\u2019t let him.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Taryn Duarte\n - Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I\u2019m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella, The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it\u2019s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I\u2019m ready for it. Oh, and in case I haven\u2019t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don\u2019t say that lightly. I thought in The Cruel Prince that it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while reading The Wicked King I realized that it\u2019s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you\u2019ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical. \n\n\u201cYou are my dearest punishment.\u201d\n\nBut this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it\u2019s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to put your own life on the line, isn\u2019t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever been as happy reading a book as I\u2019ve been reading The Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It\u2019s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word. \n\n\u201cHe looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t share anything.\u201d\n\nOverall, this review doesn\u2019t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos, Frank Ocean, and The Wicked King by Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it\u2019s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I\u2019d just ask for more.

Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.\nJust a quick note - I got my copy from Owl Crate - this company had a wonderful monthly book subscription box along with a few special editions that I just cannot pass up!This was everything I hoped it could be, and more. Jude, a human raised in Faerieland, spent her entire life undermined and controlled by the often cruel whims of the Faeries.She's hated and feared the creatures for years. She's cowered and fled from them. She's begged and bargained her way out of torture.\nNot anymore.\nEspecially considering she now controls all of Faerieland.A few months ago, Jude was horrified to learn that her younger step-brother, Oak, is heir to the Faerie thrown. So Jude did whatever she could to save him from an early death, and that included doing something she never dreamed possible. \n\"So,\" I said. \"You enjoy being my pawn?\"He grinned lazily...\"For now.\"\nShe manipulated Cardan, a faerie prince, into making an oath of fealty to her, and then tricked him onto the thrown - in Oak's place.Jude has a year and a day to command the new High King as she wishes and to plot further methods to keep Oak safe.And with that power comes a safety Jude has never known. And she learns that she likes it.\n She craves it. \nAnd she will do anything in her power to keep her position.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t know how I will ever want anything else.\u201d \nBut, her once simple plan seems to be fraying. There are traitors all around, the sea is fighting the land, and Jude's life is threatened from every angle. \nIt seems hopeless to fight something so vast. It seems ridiculous to believe we can win.\nThe longer she holds High King under her thumb, the less she knows and the more attached she grows.\nWhat has changed? Is he different because I have forced him to be?...Or is he no different at all and I am only seeing what I want to see?\nMeanwhile, King Cardan has his own plans and schemes - and he sets several in motion, and no amount of commands from Jude could possible stop them all.And among those devious plots is something decidedly...new. Something for which Jude had no plots or plans against. Something shocking and crazy. Something utterly insane\n\"It seems I have a singular taste for women who threaten me.\"\nThe wicked High King seems to be changing into something...something wholly different.\nKiss me until I am sick of it.\nNo matter what happens, Jude must remain focused. For one step, one toe out of line and she could be snuffed out in an instance. Deep breath in. Deep breath outOHMYGOSH - HOW CAN I POSSIBLY LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT BOOK THREE IN MY HANDS RIGHT THIS VERY MOMENT??????Those of you who have read it,\n am I right or am I right?\nThose of you who haven't read it, what in the h*ll are you doing reading a review when you can be reading this book?In short - the sequel was everything I wished for and more. I cannot believe that it was this good. I have fallen in love with all of the characters twofold. Jude has matured wonderfully and her schemes are so intricate that all I can do is lean back and be impressed.Cardan, the Wicked King, is absolutely wicked in the best way possible. I don't have enough words in the world to describe how in love I am with him.The way Jude and Cardan dance around each other actually made my heart race - I don't think I've ever been this invested in a relationship before. Simply magical.Speaking of magic - wow! The world of Faerie a la Holly Black is (as always) absolutely stunning. I love, love, love the way she weaves such a complicated web. I could read her world over and over and never be tired of it.The plot was fabulous, the way it slowly picked up speed and that ending - whew. I'm still reeling. I cannot get over everything that happened. Couldn't tear my eyes away!Also, I have a theory about the end: (view spoiler)[ The king said that Jude was banished until the crown pardons her...does anyone else think Holly Black is aiming for Jude to pardon herself? She does have a crown now... (hide spoiler)]Simply put, \nHolly Black is Queen\n.

Holly is a delightfully cruel author and I love and hate her for it. It's very confusing. I'm not sure I can write this review as a 'sane' person but I'll try. Disclosure: spoilers for the first book, but not for this one!\u00a0\n\n\"Your ridiculous family might be surprised\u00a0to find that not everything is solved by murder,\" Locke calls after me.\"We would be surprised to find that,\" I call back.\n\nSo, we still have Jude, who is as pleasant as ever as she schemes restlessly to keep the power she stole at the end of the first book. Not only does she have to keep Cardan, who is... well, the same Cardan we all came to love, in check, but she now has to deal with the entire court who would love nothing more than to do away with her.But let's start with our favorite resident princeling.\n\n\"You've won yourself a year and a day,\" he told me. \"But a lot can happen in a year and a day. Give me all the commands you want, but you'll never think of everything.\"\n\nCardan, while utterly himself, continued to surprise me. He's one of those unpredictable wildcard characters, and though nothing he does is really 'surprising', he still leaves you baffled and scratching your head at every turn. But the best part? His relationship with Jude is tense, angsty, full of 'what even just happened' moments, and ahhh, I can't say much more but it was so DAMN fun.Maybe grab a fan.\n\n\u00a0\"I wondered if it wasn't you shooting bolts at me.\"I make a face at him. \"And what made you decide it wasn't?\"He grins up at me. \"They missed.\"\n\nYou never quite know what he has up his sleeve or his true intentions, and trust me, he'll leave you guessing until the very end - not to mention, he might be a tad more powerful than we all expected.\n\n\"Surely you have noticed that since his reign began, the isles are different. Storms come in faster. Colors are a bit more vivid, smells are sharper.\"\n\nThen we have Madoc, Jude's 'stepfather' whom she totally betrayed and made a fool of at the end of the first book. As you can guess, he's not thrilled. So not only is Madoc and the rest of Jude's 'family' on edge and trying to get their clutches on her, we have the rest of the faerie court, all of whom are suuuuper suspicious as to why Cardan has Jude by his side all the time. Oh, and then there's Locke, who is still... awful. And he... of course... causes problems. As he does.Basically, everyone wants to take Jude down.AND.As if that isn't enough, we have our lovely albeit rotten Queen of the Sea and her oh-so-sweet daughter, Nicasia, both of whom hate Jude with a fiery passion.I'm not going to lie - this book is 90% court intrigue, scheming, and angst, which if you know me, that's all I could ever want. If you aren't into that, you might not love it as much as I did. It isn't as if a TON happens, but for me, it never ceased to entertain. Holly is brilliant, not only with her words and one-liners but with her planning and characterization.Jude continues to be a unique, rage-filled yet somehow relatable character who stands out in the YA market. She's fiery, witty, mean, and yet she still finds a way to burrow into your heart. That's good writing, folks. She's easily one of my favorite characters ever, and I can't help but love her no matter what decisions she makes.Full of twists and turns, I couldn't put it down. So many scenes are like a punch in the face, while others made me feel like I was DROWNING, scrambling for air.

I'm like Fever series-level addicted right now and I don't know how I can possibly wait for book three. Also: Cardan is evil and terrible and I am in love with him. I wish I was sorry.This book got me so good. The banter and sexual tension between Jude and Cardan had me on the edge of my seat, all googly-eyed like a schoolgirl with a crush. The political machinations, lying and backstabbing are all so damn thrilling. I saw literally nothing coming, though I don't know if that was the author's genius or just because I was too immersed in the story to play detective.I'll keep this vague for those who haven't read The Cruel Prince yet. This book picks up where the last left off - Jude has negotiated herself into a position of power and she fully intends to exploit it. The dynamic between her and Cardan has to be the sexiest I have read in a very long time. I like that they are both powerful people, both a little morally-questionable, because it makes all the love/hate angst so much fun. I dislike when one character in a relationship holds all the power and uses it against the other, but these two are equals (for better and for worse).\n\"For a moment,\" he says, \"I wondered if it wasn't you shooting bolts at me.\"I make a face at him. \"And what made you decide it wasn't?\"He grins up at me. \"They missed.\"\nThough, I also love all the characters. I love Madoc and the strange relationship between him, Taryn, and Jude - he is their father figure, and yet he also murdered their parents. I love Vivi because she just knows \"Revenge is sweet but ice cream is sweeter.\" I love the Bomb, and all the villains.You know, this is exactly how I enjoy romance - tucked away behind action, kidnappings and betrayal. There's actually a really compelling plot here, full of twists and surprises and the threat of war, and it only serves to make the sexy banter more thrilling when we are finally treated to it. Holly Black is such a tease.And she's also evil. It's not right to call the ending a cliffhanger, and yet it is so deliciously evil.

She\u2019s revered as the \u201cQueen of Faeries\u201d for a reason \u2013 the dark folklore behind the world she has created has the power to disturb you and also enchant you. I\u2019ve reach much of her work, but  The Wicked King  impressed me in a new way. Holly\u2019s prose is so delicate yet forceful. I was captivated throughout the entire novel by her writing alone. That, combined with an expansive magical universe and suspenseful plot made it one of the most notable fantasy books I\u2019ve read in quite some time.I\u2019m aware I\u2019m the odd one out here, but I do not care for Jude & Cardan\u2019s relationship whatsoever. They\u2019re both incredibly complex characters with undeniable chemistry, but I just personally could not care less about a romance between them. I feel I\u2019d view the book identically if they were archenemies, friends, or just strict allies. Personally, it\u2019s just not what draws me in to The Folk of the Air.What DOES draw me to the series is the plot and political intrigue. I\u2019m woefully obsessed with Holly Black\u2019s ability to create unique political tensions and guide a society through the brink of war. There were so many scenes strewn throughout the novel the had my \u201ceyes glued to the page\u201d (or rather, my ears glued to my headphones \u2013 the audiobook is super immersive!) I cannot get enough of the scheming, vengeance, and betrayal coming from every corner of story.Though The Cruel Prince and The Wicked King have shown to both be polarizing reads, I found the second installment to be equally as satisfying as the first. It\u2019s a series consistent in it\u2019s quality, therefore if you enjoyed the first, I believe the second will be just as fulfilling. The Folk of the Air continues to be one of my auto-recommendations for gripping and sophisticated fantasy series.", "At this point, I don\u2019t know why the rest of us even try.

I already talked a lot about why I loved The Cruel Prince, so I guess I\u2019ll just give a quick summary: antiheroes, court intrigue, power plays, and a fish out of water in a world full of monsters - but this time, she\u2019s determined to seize the same power. And it\u2019s badass.Jude\u2026 is so great. She's seriously becoming one of my favorite fictional characters of all time, and I don't really know how? Her narrative voice is so strong, shaping and characterizing the world around her. The strength of her voice perfectly counteracts the desperation we see within her to cling to power, to not give up the few gains she has made. She's so delightfully unlikable and yet manages to gain audience sympathy at every moment. The side characters here are particularly great. I particularly like the relationship between the Bomb & the Roach; the backstory we got for them here was excellent. Vivi is as fantastic as ever, but I actually love what was done with her character [I\u2019ll talk about this later]. The Wicked King is also pushed up by a series of interesting villains; while I am emphatically not a Locke or Nicasia fan, Taryn is intriguing and I want more of her, and Madoc is always a delight. Oh, and then there\u2019s Cardan, the Sort Of Love Interest, who I find both incredibly compelling and very dislikable.I think what I\u2019m most fascinated about with this book is how it plays with the dynamic of humans wresting whatever power they can. The idea of fairies not understanding the stakes of their own world on the level that human characters do. Vivi, as someone who grew up a fairy, does not understand how Jude was affected by her childhood - she was never charmed, or manipulated, or forced to play the games that Jude was. And the dynamic between Cardan and Jude is perfect; Jude clinging to the little power she has over Cardan, and Cardan being under someone\u2019s thumb, just one more time.I\u2019m not sure how I felt about parts of the dynamic between Cardan and Jude; there\u2019s a continuous lack of dictated consent in their interactions, which makes sense for the situation and is still bothersome. But also, I\u2019m kind of obsessed with their relationship. They have so much sexual tension and it kills me. I cannot wait to see where it goes. And also, guys, there were so many fucking plot twists I\u2019m laughing. i have no idea how I even felt about the final twist but literally everything else was so fucking legit and I screamed about eight times reading this book. Basically, that was everything I liked about The Cruel Prince, but like... more. Jude is seriously one of my favorite fictional characters ever and the plot twists killed me and I'm super into the romance.

I am too obsessed.[Read 1] Jan 2019WHY DON'T YOU JUST PICK UP MY LIMP CARCASS AND TOSS IT 50FT INTO THE SEA TOO. omfg. This was excellent in the most ragey beautiful perfectly poisonous and mind twisty way. I am reeling and also want to s c r e a m myself into the next dimension becauseIneedbook3ajfdsaldhgoh these feelings should be illegal. i am not used to feeling all these things. \u27b8 Again I put forth the fact that these are the MOST Slytherin books.They are about mind games and plot twists. They are about characters outwitting and undermining each other, and not just Jude. We have Madoc playing his own games and Cardan starts to stop being a veritable flop and grows into his sullen mouth and power as the high king, and that's not even counting on the OTHER COURTS who have agendas and wishes. The queen of the undersea, Orlagh, features in this one and she is putting forth her own murder games. And I just !!! you think you know something and then tHERE IS A DECOY PLOT FOR THE DECOY PLOT. I can't even.My heart is just thRIVING on this. I swear. My slytherin soul sings.\u27b8 Cardan and Jude? Slayed me. I am dead. fUlly fully dead.I mean from the moment Cardan sleight-of-hand steals Jude's ring and then wears it, we know he is flirting with her. They hate that they like each other bUT THEY DO. And look: I'm not a romance-inclined person: but omfg these two. They kisses. The murder-flirting (shh that's a term). The tWISTS at the end with what these two do together...I just...I cannot. It gave us more more more of what we wanted and also managed to make it vicious and untrustworthy and intoxicating. THIS IS HATE-TO-LOVE (?? i mean, not quite love but something) AT ITS FINEST.\u27b8 Also the stakes just crawl higher.Jude learns the very important lesson that claiming power is much easier than keeping it. And omg this girl. I want her to have a nap. The book is set 5months after TCP, and Jude basically never sleeps. She needs a soft pretzel and a hug from someone she can trust (WHO, THO. REALLY WHO) and I love her to pieces. But we have murder, betrayal, vicious mind-games, lust and love and entrancing kisses, and friendships you want to trust but oh oh can you trust anything?!\u27b8 And we already know Holly Black is a WRITING QUEEN.Her descriptions just have me falling head-over-heels in love with Faerie. Yes, hopeless mortal here *waves languidly* don't even care. I just LOVE the descriptions, the fey culture, how she weaves in other courts and their games and japes and terrors....am I going to stop gushing soon??? I DON'T KNOW, AM I?!? I freaking adored this book. I knew I would but like holy wow it sets the bar so high for 2019.But what I like best is that (a) it's surprising and maddening, (b) it takes you on an adventure that is like dancing on silver knife blades, (c) it gives you a sliver of what you want and then snatches it away, and (d) THAT CLIFFHANGER.

The agonizing two year wait for the third book!", "\nKing: wickedWig: snatchedReview: to come\n", "Power is so much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.I'm not sure if I should be happy or angry? This book was, undoubtedly, my most anticipated book of the year. But I must confess, it did not quite live up to my expectations. That's not to say it is not a good book, it was just a tad slow for my taste. The book doesn't really pick up until about the 60% mark. After that though, things definitely get interesting. Main Characters' Ranking:Jude = Cardan > Madoc = Vivi >> Locke >>>>>>>> Taryn Previously I disliked Taryn for being weak and complicit, but now I just loathe her for being a lousy, backstabbing, sorry excuse for a sister. The Relationships:Madoc & JudeEven though I know they'll never truly reconcile, some small part of me wishes they would because honestly a Madoc and Jude team-up would be epic. They would have all of Faerie bending to their will. No question. It is clear that despite her previous betrayal Madoc does still care about Jude and wants her to join his side. \"Does our High King have any idea how good you are at running this kingdom for him?\"\"Keep hoping he doesn't\"\"Oh, I shall, daughter, much as I hope you will realize how much better it would be if you were to be running it for your own family.\"But alas he is still who he is and any sort of personal feelings he may have fall second to his boundless ambition. Jude & TarynIf this series somehow ends with Jude easily forgiving Taryn for betraying her AGAIN. I will riot!\n\n Honestly, this is the reason I did not even bother to read The Lost Sisters. Because any amount of Taryn is too much Taryn for me. I do not care what anyone says about how she has her own way of coping or surviving in Faerie. Because the bottom line is both Jude and Taryn have suffered in this world their whole lives, but only ONE of them has betrayed the other. TARYN. Sure Jude may not have told Taryn her every plan and secret, but never once has Jude intentionally done something to harm Taryn. NOT ONCE. And just when she starts to let her sister back in, Taryn just slaps her in the face with another betrayal. \n\nHonestly, I am so done with this relationship. May it wither and die. Jude & CardanTo put it simply this relationship is a mess. A beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. Because once again we're forced to watch truly deeply damaged individuals fight their obviously growing feelings for one another because they lack the fundamental key to a healthy relationship, trust. On Jude's part: ...that I like him better than I've ever liked anyone and that of all the things he's ever done to me, making me like him so much is by far the most...and all I want to do is walk into his arms. I want to drown my worries in his embrace. I want him to say something totally unlike himself, about things being okay. Kill him before he makes you love him \n\nOn Cardan's part: \"Kiss me again, he says, drunk and foolish. \"Kiss me until I am sick of it.\"\"If you're the sickness, I suppose you can't also be the cure.\"\"I wasn't kind Jude. Not to many people. Not to you. I wasn't sure if I wanted you or if I wanted you gone from my sigh so that I would stop feeling as I did, which made me even more unkind. But when you were gone-truly gone beneath the waves-I hated myself as I never have before.\"\n\nThese two have the makings of something beautifully tragic. And I suppose the ending of this book makes some people angry. Angry at Cardan. But personally, I found it fitting. A betrayal to answer a betrayal. An eye for an eye. It is the world they live in. The only way to win is to play, and it seems Cardan is finally done taking a backseat. So while I am disappointed our girl got played, I am not mad at Cardan for finally taking his life into his own hands. And that's the tea. \n\nSidenote: one running theme I found quite amusing is how often people pointed out Jude's affinity for murder.For example: Locke-Jude \"Your ridiculous family might be surprised to find that not everything is solved by murder.\"\"We would be surprised to find that.\"Cardan-Jude-The Roach-The Bomb\"The three of you have one solution to every problem. Murder. No key fits every lock.\"\"Someone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.\"All-in-all this was a mighty fine read and a great book to kick off my year. ===NOTE: My Headcanon came true!!!Headcanon: Cardan and Jude will continue to have an unwanted, yet undeniable pull and attraction to one another. And one of those times will involve some fun with Cardan's tail. \n\n", "CONGRATULATIONS-Goodreads Choice Awards YA Fantasy Winner!Ok so here's the deal-I wasn't crazy about The Cruel Prince. There, I said it. The reason I'm starting this review with a seemingly negative attitude is two-fold: 1) It shows the sheer amount of growth that Black provides between the first two books in this series and 2) It shows that I'm not just blowing smoke up your ass and being pushed to give this a high rating to boost sales. The Wicked King was a true delight and privilege to read, my fellow bookworms, and I hope I can do it a shred of justice while discussing it here. This review is 100% spoiler free!Our story begins five months after the events of The Cruel Prince take place, and we are immediately thrown into the narrative with dollops of those previous five months sprinkled in along the way. While I suppose it isn't ABSOLUTELY necessary, I would highly encourage you to pick up the novella The Lost Sisters as it gives an insightful look into Taryn's side of things during TCP (and also packs an extra emotional punch for a particular twist included at the end of this novel). There are a lot of moving parts to this middle installment, and some may seem fairly unrelated in the beginning, but by the end they all come together nicely for a whopper of an ending.The aspect that stands out most to me regarding The Wicked King is the tremendous amount of character growth accomplished in just a short amount of time (and page count). Where TCP featured fairly typical/stereotypical characters for YA fantasy and only really connected me to the story near the ending when the twists started coming, TWK really fleshed out the deepest, darkest desires and fears of our cast and put them on display for their fellow peers. I don't want to say too much, but by the end of this novel I felt such a connection to many of the characters that I didn't really care about the previous go around.AND THAT ENDING?! It's been quite some time since I've been so taken aback multiple times in the final 25% of a novel. It was waves of twists, turns, and heart breaking revelations. The ending is enough to make you dig out a tub of ice cream and wallow in your emotional breakdown for days. I have some thoughts on how I feel the next book could go, but after the ending here, Ms. Black has shown the reader that she owns these folks and she'll do with them as she pleases. Muahahahaha I think I'll stop here and just let you experience it for yourself, but if you haven't pre-ordered this one yet, what are you waiting for? Despite having read this one already, I have still managed to pre-order the regular hardcover and the BN special edition.... because obviously, my shelves need this blessing in their life. <3", "\nme reading the folk of the air trilogy in a day *spoilers*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLg5D...cardan to jude:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QoHr...---------------------------not going to exhaustively review this because everyone and their mom will. but i fucking loved this, no surprise. could have been smuttier, and the ending was... cliff-y but whatever. holly can do no wrong.\n", "#1 The Cruel Prince \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605#2 The Wicked King \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 #3 The Queen of Nothing ???After the shocking turn of events that finished off The Cruel Prince, Jude is fighting with everything she\u2019s got to keep the kingdom of Elfhame from falling to pieces under its new rulers. Unfortunately for Jude, not only is a war brewing in the Undersea, but the court is full of traitors\u2014and a few of them might be in her own home.I loved The Cruel Prince, but I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sold on certain factors\u2014yet, from the moment I finished reading it, I\u2019ve been saying the same thing: \u201cEverything I struggled with in book 1, I know will be better in book 2.\u201d Was I right? Let me put it this way: you know the \u201csecond book slump\u201d people always refer to in trilogies? NOT AN ISSUE HERE. Everything that The Cruel Prince does well, The Wicked King does \nPERFECTLY.\n\n\u2192 L I K E S :\n\n I\u2019ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t know how I will ever want anything else.\nFirst, without spoiling anything, let\u2019s get this out of the way: the weird, hateful, hot-and-cold relationship between Jude and Cardan progresses flawlessly, and by that I mean I cheered, I raged, I cried, I swooned, I blushed, I raged some more\u2026 it\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen enemies-to-lovers done quite like this, because at all times, they\u2019re kind of\u2026 both? Let me tell you, the phrase \u201cI hate you\u201d has never been this sexy.\nMy body has acclimated, and now it craves what it should revile.\nAnd Jude, my gods, JUDE. She is a masterpiece. I love her so much. She\u2019s coldhearted, cruel, murderous, backstabbing, and a total antihero in all the best ways. She\u2019s earned herself a permanent place on my favorite \u201cterrifying leading ladies I love\u201d list. She\u2019s also so clever and strong; despite being betrayed at every possible turn, she manages to constantly work things to her favor\u2014or, at the very least, to take someone else down with her as brilliantly as possible.\n\u201cThe last room Cardan occupied caught fire. Let me rephrase. It caught fire because he lit it on fire.\u201d\nAlso, Holly Black\u2019s writing is just legitimately so funny, I can\u2019t even describe. It\u2019s incredibly rare that a book makes me laugh out loud, but I cracked up over so many weird and ridiculous moments\u2014usually pertaining to Cardan\u2019s absolute lack of any common decency and/or sense.\n Angry was better than being scared. Better than remembering she was a mortal among monsters.\nFinally, of course, there\u2019s the world. I adore Holly\u2019s commitment to writing a version of Faerieland that follows legitimate fae lore, and just like in the first book, that authenticity comes through effortlessly. All the world-building and political complexity she offered in the first book paid off so well in this sequel.\n\u2192 D I S L I K E S :\n\nThat I like him better than I\u2019ve ever liked anyone and that of all the things he\u2019s ever done to me, making me like him so much is by far the worst.\nLiterally the \nonly\n thing I didn\u2019t like about The Wicked King is the fact that I have over a year to wait before finding out what the hell is going on with this terrible, infuriating, priceless cliffhanger ending. I mean, take the way Jude feels about Cardan, and that\u2019s basically me towards Holly Black right now, except replace the \u201cburning carnal desire\u201d with \u201cdesperate need to find out how it all ends, right NOW\u201d.\n\u2192 F I N A L THOUGHTS :\nIn all seriousness, The Wicked King was literal perfection in my eyes and I would not change a single thing. I flew through it, I loved every page, I highlighted so many quotes I can\u2019t even fit a quarter of them in this review, and I don\u2019t know if I have ever felt so simultaneously torn and obsessed with any pairing as I am over Jude and Cardan.Oh, and one more thing: TARYN STILL AIN\u2019T SHIT.\n\u2192 RECOMMENDING TO\u2026 :\nEveryone. Just\u2026 literally everyone.All quotes come from an advance copy and may not match the final release. Thank you so much to a very sweet (and unnamed) friend for loaning me their ARC!", "I genuinely cannot believe this book was basically about what happens when you let a drunk furry be king\n\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.\u201d \nYOOO Holly Black did it again! The politics !! The characters !!! The angst !!! AND THAT ENDING. I enjoyed this even more than book one - it was so dark, twisted, with even more political intrigue, betrayal and scheming. Part two especially was incredible, and all leading up to that ENDING. It packed the biggest punch, and I am so, so, so freakin excited to see where she goes and what she does next with book two. \n\u201cKiss me again,\u201d he says, drunk and foolish. \u201cKiss me until I am sick of it.\u201d \nThe Wicked King opens a few weeks after the ending of The Cruel Prince. Almost immediately we are thrown back into the action and politics, and catch up with all the main characters and how what happened at the end of TCP is affecting them. I don't want to talk too much about plot due to spoilers but read my review of the cruel prince if you haven't read that book yet. The pacing of this book was much better than the first one. I immediately was drawn right back into the world and the politics. These books are so immersive and I think that is what makes them so fun. You really get caught up in the characters world and care SO MUCH about what is happening to them - and I think being sucked into a whole new world and forgetting your own is one of the best things about fantasy. This series does that for me so well, so even if there is other things I don't love as much in here, I really have to give it points for the pure joy that this escapism gives me. Just like The Cruel Prince, the politics in this also kept me right on my toes. I really love how Holly Black plays with perspective in these books, and uses off-page action to conceal the motivations and plans of various characters. She is really good at building mystery - giving you just enough to get intrigued but not enough to guess everything that going to happen. But I also am SO GRATEFUL her reveals make sense - that feeling when everything suddenly clicks into place and you wonder how you missed it all along is the best. \n\u201cI hate you,\u201d I breathe into his mouth. \u201cI hate you so much that sometimes I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d \nAND with that quote ! Lets talk characters -- \u2728\nJude\n ACTUAL love of my life. She is too powerful, extremely scary in a hot way and its my kink. I really think Jude is such a GREAT main character. I've said this about her before but I adore how ruthless and cold she is - the fact she borders on villain (and would look like the villain if this wasn't from her POV) is so interesting and I just really enjoy following her. The Wicked King really exposes more of her insecurities and flaws which I liked, the development has been good and I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT SHE DOES IN QUEEN OF NOTHING FUCK IT UP QUEEN I ADORE YOU. \u2728\nCardan\n thats ! my ! man !! At this point in my YA reading career I'm used to falling for the actual dickhead white boy and I was got again. Anyways, I don't really like him but his character is so fun. He had so much development in this, and a lot more page time which was nice. His and Jude's scenes were easily the highlight of the book and those scenes above all really sucked me in. I will say - I kinda wasn't loving some of his backstory. But I'm going to get more into that in the romance section so stay tuned. \u2728\nTaryn\n I'm just gonna say it .... yall hate on her WAY too much and she doesn't deserve it. I actually really like Taryn. She is a literal juxtaposition of Jude - I mean they're idential twins, raised in the same home in the same situation, two sides of the same coin who chose different paths but could have easily been the other. Do you know how much I LIVE for that shit. Taryn is basically Jude - like if this was from Taryn's point of view, Jude would look like what Taryn looks like to us and I find that INTERESTING AS FUCK. So yeah, her roll in the series is so intriguing to me and of all the characters in Queen of Nothing, I'm actually MOST excited to see what she does. \u2728\nEveryone else\n Honestly, I don't have many thoughts on Madoc except I wish he wasn't there anymore. The Roach and the Bomb as Jude's weird murder found family was cute. Locke can choke. Nicasia intrigued me quite a lot in this and I hope we get more on her history with Cardan - is it bad I kinda ship her and Cardan a lot ?? Vivi was a MESS and everything she did was bad. Orlagh should have been in it more. Balekin is the most annoying little shit. \n\u201cSomeone tries to betray the High King, murder. Someone gives you a harsh look, murder. Someone disrespects you, murder. Someone ruins your laundry, murder.\u201d\nRomance: WARNING, MILD SPOILERSand here we get into my .......... reservations. First of all, I just don't care that much about Jude and Cardan. Genuinely, I just care about the politics and characters and the romance is just kinda .. there. And while I admit I did enjoy their scenes because the two have good banter and presence when in the same scenes, I am SO iffy on their romance. The romance just ? Look, Cardan is literally awful. And Jude is just as awful back to him. And I could handle their romance when it was like \"we hate eachother so much but also lets fuck\" like it was some freak shit but I could handle it. and while it remains that, I also think it's slightly moving into \"lets redeem the bad boy\" territory and I'm .. not into it? First of all, it defeats the point of all the enemy lovers stuff but it's also just a bad trope. Anyways, when it was giving all that backstory about Cardan I was getting nervous. So I have my reservations. I will wait to see about Queen of Nothing. But also, I feel like I just don't care enough about them so I haven't really analysed or thought about it all that much? I know not caring about the romance is an unpopular opinion. ALTHO, I will say that scene where  they fuck while saying how much they hate eachother was hot. \u201cYou must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring. The first lesson is to make yourself that strong.\u201d Overall the Cruel Prince is a strong second book - definitely stronger than the first. It really develops on what was established in book one, but brings everything into a much larger scale, and raises the stakes so much. Jude is a great main character to follow, and I love how this series plays around with morality and virtue - I think the last book is going to be the best one of them all and I cannot wait for it. ", "\nDear Holly Black, How dare you. wtf. I am a mess.\n", "Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Roshani who was like \"lol, lemme jus sit down with my coffee and read a Holly Black book.\" That was the end of that. The book consumed her. The coffee has long since evaporated and moss and ivy crawled over its porcelain shell and one could not tell it had ever been a drinking apparatus. The girl had become one with the earth. Small thorns and blood-colored flowered bloomed around her head, and she choked out a single word: \". . . C A R D A N.\"And that is why, my children, YOU DON'T READ A HOLLY BLACK BOOK KNOWING YOU'VE GOT BASICALLY TWO YEARS TO WAIT FOR THE FINALE. WTF. WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF. I AM DISTRAUGHT.", "Can I just write an entire review repeating everything hurts, over and over again. Because\u00a0EVERYTHING REALLY HURTS. It's been over a month since I've read this and it still just really, really fucking hurts, okay? Holly Black has done it again. She's ruined my life, made me question my sanity, and need a cold shower after reading this book. Even though I was incredibly excited for this book I still had my doubts that\u00a0The Wicked King\u00a0would top The Cruel Prince. I shouldn't have been worried though because this was everything.\u00a0This book basically solidified the fact that I would indeed lay down my life for Jude and Cardan.The Wicked King has a lot more scheming and court politics in it compared to the first book, and while normally I'm more of an action packed type of gal, this really worked for me. I found myself falling more and more in love with my queen Jude and trying to figure Cardan out. Because I mean, as far as unpredictable characters go he is the most unpredictable, especially in the end \ud83d\ude2d. The scheming, the twists and turns, the TENSION, was all unbelievably good. You will need a cold shower before, during, and after this book because the tension is so thick between Jude and Cardan it hurts. Also, here is a friendly reminder that Cardan had a tail, because I forgot and was shook to my core when his pants came off. You be the judge of why his pants came off, my lips are sealed...Anyway, less tail talk more book talk. We still have our amazing group of characters that we've grown to love and hate. Jude, is desperately trying to hold on to her power she tricked her way into. Cardan, is still defying Jude every step of the way. Taryn, is still The Worst Sister Alive. Locke, is awful. Madoc, is less than thrilled with the stunt Jude pulled in the end of the first book. Nicasia, is just as petty and spiteful as ever and ready for what her and her mother, the Queen of the Sea believe should be hers. So yeah, no pressure for Jude to hold on to her power over Cardan.Now, while I won't give away any of the plot twists or the ending, just know you are in for a world of pain. If you thought the ending of\u00a0The Cruel Prince\u00a0was torturous, oh sweet child, you haven't seen anything yet. What would this story be without twists and turns that physically make you feel like someone is squeezing you so tight you can't breathe? The ending of The Cruel Prince is laughable compared to the ending of The Wicked King. I would tell you all to prepare yourselves, but let's face it, no amount of preparation will have you ready. 2019 is going to be a year filled with\u00a0PAIN AND MISERY until The Queen of Nothing is released in 2020. \nFavorite Quotes\n\n\"Your ridiculous family might be surprised\u00a0to find that not everything is solved by murder,\" Locke calls after me.\"We would be surprised to find that,\" I call back.\n\n\"Watching my back is the perfect opportunity to stick a knife in it.\"\n\n\"For a moment,\" he says, \"I wondered if it wasn't you shooting bolts at me.\"\n\nI make a face at him. \"And what made you decide it wasn't?\"\n\nHe grins up at me. \"They missed.\"\n\n\"If you're the sickness, I suppose you can't also be the cure.\"\n\n\"We show her that I am no feckless High King.\"\n\n\"And how do we do that?\" I ask.\n\n\"With great difficulty,\" he says.\n\n\"Since I fear she is right.\"\nAll in all, this book was perfect. It was the right amount of love, lust, hate, and pain. Now excuse me while I lay in bed and cry until 2020 because I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to live with myself until\u00a0The Queen of Nothing is out!Blog | Twitter | Instagram", "When I went into this series I thought: \u201ctehehe, I bet this is over hyped\u201d \u2014 so believe me when I say I'm actually shocked by how much I've come to love this series. It is not at all the kind of YA that I'm used to and neither are the characters. The folk of the Air is in a league of its own. I loved every moment of this book. The scheming, the lies, the betrayals. *wipes away a tear* It was just so good. \u26a0\nIf you have not read book 1 (the cruel prince), do not go any further\n\u26a0\nPower is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.\nJude is finally where she always dreamt of being \u2013 in power. But keeping it is more difficult than gaining it. Her reasons for her actions leading up to where she is now, is to make sure Oak is safe. Her bargain with Carden means she is only in control for one year and a day. But she likes being in charge even if none of the faeries know that Jude is the brains behind Carden, the one pulling the strings. Time is running out. Enemies and traitors are everywhere. And Carden, who is still pissed about being tricked into being king, is starting to look too comfortable on the throne. Jude has to figure out a way to make sure he doesn't get rid of her at his first chance. \nFear is terrible, but the combination of hope and fear is worse.\nThis series is not for everyone. I can see why many are not a fan of Jude and her selfish ambition. There is also the \u2018problem\u2019 of the first half of the books dragging but I find myself NOT MINDING ONE BIT. I've come to notice that Holly has a trend in having a slow pace for the first half of her books. It makes me excited to get to the second half where I know she will shock my socks off.Jude is so lonely in this book. She has all these secrets and responsibilities and no one to share them with. I was so proud of her for all that she accomplished.I was not Carden's biggest fan in book 1, but I actually have come to really like him. Jude and the Court really underestimate him. They think he's this spoiled brat who couldn't care less about what's going on, but I think Carden is smart and knows how to play a part. For those of you who read the book, you know what I'm talking about \ud83d\ude0f.I know that many readers are outraged at (view spoiler)[Carden for what he does at the end. But to be honest my first thought was: GO CARDEN! I mean it was pretty clever of him. He ain't nobodies puppet now \ud83d\ude0f. (hide spoiler)]The plot twists were superb and the ending was shocking and brilliant. There are so many possibilities for how the final book will end and I'm so nervous but excited!!______\nMy reviews for:\nNB: all these books are set in the same world.Modern Faerie Tales seriesBook #1 : TitheBook #2 : ValiantBook #3 : IronsideThe Folk of the Air seriesBook #1 : The Cruel PrinceBook #1.5 : The Lost SistersBook #3 : The Queen of Nothing", "9/26/19Yep, I've done this dumb thing again (3rd time! when will I learn?) - read this book with 2 MORE MONTHS OF WAIT UNTIL THE FINALE IS PUBLISHED!Otherwise, brilliant.

The intensity and complexity of the love drama feels much more mature than something a bunch of 17-year olds would cook up.  Update 1/15/19\"DENY ME!\"Oh, I got the chills again. The drama of it all is so yummy! Still have no idea how I want it to end, besides my ship to continue to rock, obviously.Original review4.5 starsNot sure how much I should write about this sequel. After all, the strength of this series is in a large part in its plot twists and turns. So I'll keep the story details to a minimum I guess.It's 5 months after the ending of the The Cruel Prince. Jude is mostly preoccupied with keeping Cardan on the throne and under her control for a time much longer than a year and a day. Both goals are hard to achieve - there are various factions scheming to take the crown from Cardan, and he himself isn't too thrilled to be a puppet (well, unless this puppet makes out with his puppeteer, then he seems to like it just fine;0). Indeed, it is much harder to hold on to power than to usurp it. The structure of The Wicked King mirrors that of its prequel. It's kind of slow (on drama) in the beginning, with Jude trying to balance all the players in her game. I was entertained, but also a bit tired out by Jude's frenetic, restless search for solutions to multiple problems (that girl gets no break!). I wanted some rest and a bit more... meat in the story maybe, some more world-building, flash-backs or deep back stories, anything to divert me from Jude's constant state of anxiety. I never got that break. What I did get was more drama and heartache closer to the end. That ending was a real punch in the gut, and I loved it (I do like to suffer and be mad though). Kudos to Holly Black for holding my attention way into the 3rd book of this series. I am not sure what I want the ending to be exactly at this point. I am going to settle for JUDE+CARDAN=FRVR for now? P.S. Publishers need to stop releasing ARCs so early. OMG! So much longer to wait for The Queen of Nothing. (yes, first world problems, I know).P.P.S. Some people in this series are incorrigibly crap! Just saying.", "\n\nInstagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThe relationship between author and reader is one of constant courting, and sequels are especially hard. You've won my trust once, with a stellar book, but that's no guarantee that I'm going to enjoy the sequel. Second Book Syndrome is totally a thing. It's what happens when authors get complacent and think that less effort can be expended when publishing their sequel. I loved THE CRUEL PRINCE, despite thinking it would be a disappointment, and immediately added THE WICKED KING to my to-read list. The wait was agonizing and plagued with self-doubt. Would I still enjoy the sequel as much as I'd enjoyed the prequel? Would it live up to my expectations? Did I really enjoy THE CRUEL PRINCE as much as I thought I had? The answer to all these questions was \"yes.\" Yes, I enjoyed the sequel. Yes, it lived up to my expectations and then some. Yes, I love this series. It is the bomb.THE WICKED KING starts off rather similarly to how THE CRUEL PRINCE did, by which I mean slow AF. Cardan is the High King of Faerie and also Jude's puppet, but her power over him only lasts for a year and a day, and she knows that as soon as that grace period is over, he's just going to be one person in a long line of many who wants Jude dead. Most of the first third of the book is Jude attempting to get all of her fey ducks in a row, scheming and conspiring, while also (hopelessly) trying to resist her growing attraction for Cardan.I loved that THE WICKED KING was much more sensual and erotic than THE CRUEL PRINCE was. One of my biggest complaints about the first book was that it felt confined by the young adult genre, and the author wasn't really exploiting this world of treachery and sensuality to its full potential. This book really runs with those darker themes, and it does it in a way that feels adult without being smutty, if that makes sense. THE WICKED KING has all of the plotting and intrigue that makes Game of Thrones so popular, but does it without the exploitative gore and porn that also make the series feel cheap. I wish that more young adult books were like this, because Jude is a total antihero and completely unlike most helpless heroines I read about who dabble in perfection as if beauty and power are just essential oils you can soak up during your latest spa day. Jude has to scrabble and work for everything she's got, and she's so competent, you can't help but like her.Also, the bad characters in this book are so awful that hating them is almost an art form. Locke reminds us right away why he's such a bastard, although he doesn't play as much of a role in this book as the previous one. Nicasia is that classic mean girl with anxiety that she tries so hard to hide. Taryn is a back-stabbing twat who likes to pretend that she's Jesus on the cross, and I was very proud of myself for not buying any of her very lame attempts at peace offerings, especially in light of the end of the novel. Fuck Taryn, seriously. Oh, and Cardan - the hero I love to hate and hate to love. The unresolved sexual tension between him and Jude is amazing. These are characters that I love to ship. I am the Helen of Troy of enemies-to-lovers in that I have launched a thousand ships for these sorts of relationships and I regret nothing. It really is like Hana Yori Dango meets Game of Thrones.Best of all, we get to explore a new part of faerie land: the Undersea. Hence the crown slipping beneath the waves on the cover. Man, I love it when everything becomes clear as you read the book. Even the title makes sense once you find out more about Cardan and where he's coming from. The beginning is dull, but necessary because it ends up setting the stage for the hot mess of schemes upon schemes upon schemes that are peppered with sex, murder, violence, and intrigue in the last two acts of the book. And that ending is so cruel. I need QUEEN OF NOTHING in my hands now.Why is 2020 so far away?4.5 to 5 stars", "Twitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??!!!mISS. hoLlY. bLaCK.\narE yOU kiDdiNG mE.\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!!!!!\nDoes this woman know it's only fucking January.....\nJ A N U A R Y\n 2019.

", "*The 2019 winner of the Goodreads Choice Awards in Young Adult Fantasy category. I mean, this is no surprise, right? \ud83d\udc51*I wanted to wait; I should have waited. Because I seriously need The Queen of Nothing! I already have like fifty theories in my head; I have no idea how I will manage the wait.After reading The Cruel Prince, I thought I knew what to expect! So, every time someone was on the page; I was like: \"S/He's definitely a traitor!\" I was analysing every single word anyone said or did not say! I expected something like this:What did I get? This:It was CRAZY! And then, I thought, okay, good it's over. I expected Jude to go all the Queen of Spies. What did I get instead?And then? The book had the audacity to end.This is the state of my mind:I'm pretty sure I will end here before The Queen of Nothing is out: (view spoiler)[-I knew it! I knew it! I was saying that I can definitely see Cardan having his own plan because no one wants to be a pawn forever! But I did not see this! The whole time I was screaming at Jude that she needs to talk with Cardan more because at the end of the day, she cannot do it without him. But when he asked her to marry him, I thought that that was it, that they will be indestructible! But when I heard those vows. DREAD. Jude spent so much time telling us how she ordered him not to move against her or anything, and none of this was included in the vow. I knew that it would end really, really bad. That\u2019s the problem with a puppet government: It\u2019s not going to run itself.- So, good for you Cardan, for not being a pawn but like WTF! - What is he going to do without her (and half his army)? - I even started to think that The Ghost might be loyal to him, now. That would be a turn. But then, I don't think (hope) that Cardan would just hand over Jude to the Undersea for some time without her control. However, I also expect he needed to get rid of her to make his own plans.- Was it indeed Madoc who tried to keep her out of the Palace after the Undersea or was it all Cardan's doing? - How is she going back? I would think that maybe since she's the Queen, the land might be tied to her? We shall see, but that will be crazy!- Hate Taryn and the moment she came to visit Jude, to mend their sisterhood, I knew that it was not right! And the moment she told Jude that she pretended that she was her and the guards or whoever believed that I knew it was going to go really bad! Jude should have cut her of Taryn's hair or something! Because this was just bound to happen!- WTF is Locke's plan? Like. I have no idea. It seems that he even wants to see Cardan fail? I wonder on whose side he is. Undersea? Cardan's? Or his new daddy in law?- The attack on Jude was so stupid and then giving those earrings to Taryn? What was he thinking? I honestly believe that Taryn knew about Locke attacking Jude. And I would kill to hear the vows between Taryn and Locke because I expect them to be super crazy! - I wonder what Madoc's plan is. He now has control over half the army. Is he going to wait and when Cardan needs his help, he is going ask for Oak to be the King? Because without Balekin there are only two options, Oak or Cardan! (Just freaked out! Cardan married Jude and then send her away after Madoc took his army! Is it possible that it was his life insurance? That there is no point in removing him when they need to remove Jude as well? Does he believe that Madoc would hesitate killing Jude?)- Is it possible that Madoc might be Jude's ticket back? Is she going to go to war against Cardan?- I seriously do not see Oak taking the throne. He seems more spoiled that Cardan ever was. Not a good choice was the King. - Cardan's mother is vile! And I hope someone kills her!- Vivi was a bit dumb, wasn't she? Like, what was she thinking? Plus I still want Jude to find out that she knew about Taryn and Locke!- I still wonder if the earring Grimsen made for Cardan has some sort of power. It would be strange if it doesn't, but I wonder if Cardan knows. - Jude was poisoning herself for months, do you want to tell me that she did not have any antidotes on hand in case something goes wrong? Double stupid!- How are Jude and Cardan supposed to work after this? And, I got my answers about Cardan's tail, but I have no idea how I feel about it!But the new pressing question is: Did Jude and Cardan sleep together? Or was it only a make-out session? First, I thought that they indeed slept together. But then I got conflicted. I'm not really sure about it. And what about Balekin? First, I guess he only kissed her but then in Hollow Hall? It seemed like more! I hate this! Give me clear answers! OMG! I just realised! Could it be possible that Roiben might be her way in? As the Queen does she have the power to allow, him to avenge the attack on him? That's the question, isn't it? What powers does she have? Can she go despite Cardan's exile because she's the Queen and is his equal? SO many questions and such a long time to wait for answers!

The satirical bent works really well here because it walks that fine line of being, given the contretemps, entirely plausible. Interesting observations about social media, men and what they want, and women who see right through them. Well worth a read.\n", "OMG! This is dark! This is incredibly funny, entertaining! This is wild! This is incredibly smart, sarcastic and sardonic! Why did I wait too long? (Bang! Bang! Bang! Nope, I didn\u2019t hit my head against the wall, this time my husband practiced his squash training with my head using oranges! I think I\u2019m going to punch him so bad after his practice\u2019s finishing!)So let\u2019s take a look at this provocative, unique, mind bending and hilarious crime story.Korede, antisocial nurse, only feeling comfortable to hang around the comatose patients has a beautiful, self-absorbed sister Ayoola who also has a unique flaw like killing people and getting away with them with them. She kills and sister comes to clean the mess. Ayoola killed third times (as a charm) and she insisted that all of these men tried to harm her, rape her blabla so what she\u2019s done for three times was self-defense!!! Look at this innocent girl suffering from bad dating experience but interestingly there is no wound, scar in her body to prove the wrongdoings of those guys.You know blood is thicker than water and family always comes first so Korede cleaned her sister\u2019s mess and acted like she believed in her.( I liked her inner thoughts and way of thinking which made me captivated! )And poor Korede has a long time crush to Tade, charming doctor. But here we go, the killer ( or poor sister who always makes the worst boyfriend choices) decides to visit her sister in her work place and Tade looks like he has a crush on her. ( Oh hell! Poor Korede, what are you gonna do now? Do you insist to choose your family over your love interest?)Of course normally Korede becomes jealous, angry, resented because even they were little, she gets the blame on for all wrongdoings of her little sister. Ayoola always takes her way because she is the beautiful one. Who believes in awkward sister suffering from mental problems?  This is the pattern of their dysfunctional relationship. Now is she going to let her sister hurt the one man she\u2019s obsessed with?Let\u2019s get our popcorn and bring out refreshments to read the end of the story. It\u2019s getting darker and more quirky, absurd, entertaining at each moment.I enjoyed THE AMAZING, REMARKABLE CHARACTER BUILDING.I loved the intriguing, riveting, fast pace.I loved the purpose of the book makes us question so many important things in our lives such as family, sisterhood bounding, social media.It was fantastic, promising debut novel fits with my entire expectations and my dark sense of sarcastic humor. I truly LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH! Cannot wait to read more works of the author!", "My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite is a 2018 Doubleday Books publication. Genius! That provocative title and amazing cover art certainly piques one's curiosity. Noticing all the positive reactions the book received, I just had to see for myself if it was worth all the kudos. Well, I have to say, this is my kind of book!! Seriously, I really, really, really love satire and dark humor. I do understand it is often an acquired taste, but it takes a special kind of creativity and balance to pull it off. Dark humor and satire are often very subtle and if you aren\u2019t in on the joke, it can sail right over your head. It requires a little more effort, from the reader, too, on occasion, and that is the case with this book.Family is supposed to help one another out, right? Set in Nigeria, amid a corrupt system of law and order, Korede is forever coming to the aid of her beautiful, but kooky, younger sister, Ayoola, who has a bad habit of killing her boyfriends. She always claims self-defense, but she\u2019s never injured, and her conscience never seems to suffer. Korede, is a borderline, antisocial nurse, more comfortable around her comatose patient, to whom she bears her soul, than with anyone else. She has a crush on Tade, a doctor she works closely with. However, when Ayoola shows up at the hospital to visit her sister, Tade is immediately smitten with her. So, not only is Korede hurt emotionally, with her sister\u2019s history with men to consider, this development is quite troubling. Deep down, Korede is angry, jealous of her beautiful, favored sister, but she always comes to her rescue. Ayoola is self-absorbed, flaunting her beauty, and appears not to notice the stress and strain she causes Korede. Both sisters are flawed, with abominable character traits, but at the same time, they both managed to, inconceivably, elicit sympathy from me. The author creates a unique brand of suspense, an ever- present sense of dread, while toying with the readers' emotions. The social commentary could be at the core of the story, perhaps playing a key role in the sisters\u2019 pathos. \u201cI cannot imagine her resorting to stabbing if that particular knife were not in her hand; almost as if it were the knife and not her that was doing the killing. But then, is that so hard to believe? Who is to say that an object does not come with its own agenda? Or that the collective agenda of its previous owners does not direct its purpose still?\u201dThere\u2019s much to ponder on in this amazing debut novel. Kordede\u2019s stoic inner thoughts stole the show for me, though. The story is meant to be dark, meant to be taken seriously, but so sardonic, it is morbidly funny at times. But, one thing is for certain, this author has done an incredible job creating these wickedly entertaining characters, adding rich layers to the story, while keeping the prose pointed and sharp, even minimal, and still manages to add the rarity of humor into the mix with perfect balance and poise. I simply could not tear my eyes off the pages. It is also a rarity for me to say I liked a book better than I thought I would, but this one caught me completely off guard. Overall, I am mightily impressed with this stunning, but unsettling debut, and yes, it deserves the kudos", "Femi makes three, you know. Three, and they label you a serial killer. In case you haven't noticed, Oyinkan Braithwaite\u2019s My Sister, the Serial Killer has been taking the social media scene by storm the past few weeks. And I get it; the cover art is (pardon my pun) killer and the title exudes a certain titillation that will make a reader quickly reach for the book on the shelf. For me, My Sister, the Serial Killer, was an easy, brisk read that I mostly read in one sitting. And I was additionally excited to read it when I realized that the author and I graduated from the same university in England and likely had the same creative writing instructors! The short chapters (some only a few sentences long) created the effect of breezing through the novel at record speed, which is a plus, but it also created a few issues for this narrative.Oyinkan Braithwaite\u2019s debut novel follows sisters Ayoola and Korede \u2013 Ayoola kills \u2018em and Korede cleans \u2018em up. But this isn\u2019t just a novel about the boyfriends falling like flies; it\u2019s a novel about the trials and bonds of sisterhood, an exploration of childhood abuse and a would-be love story all wrapped up tightly in the culture of Lagos, Nigeria. Now, that\u2019s a lot to try to cram into 240 (not even full) pages, but it can be done; I\u2019ve even seen it done well. Here, I wasn\u2019t mind-blowingly impressed by the execution (again, couldn\u2019t resist!) of My Sister, the Serial Killer. If you\u2019re a reader who puts a lot of weight on pace, you might find that you\u2019re in for a rather jerky ride with this novel. It flowed neither at a lyrically smooth pace nor at a heart-pounding thriller pace. It just sort of jerked from scene to scene with very little, if any, narrative connective tissue to sew the chapters seamlessly together. In short, while it a had a great plot and an ending that did manage to surprise me, it was not written with a lot of finesse. It read, to me, like a very first draft, not quite filled in enough to give us readers an entire picture. It was like a well-done sketch of artistry that hasn\u2019t yet been filled in with color, like the structure of a building that has not yet been painted and offered windows and balconies. Now, ONWARD to the pros that you\u2019ll find within these pages, because there are several of those. For one, it was a plus that this novel read so fast. While the plotting was jerky, the pace was quick, and that pulls you in to the story fast as you realize that you\u2019re already so deep into it with so little time spent on it. And one of the real gems of My Sister was how Braithwaite interlaced the heart-pounding narrative of the killings themselves with the humor of said serial killer\u2019s indifference and feigned naivet\u00e9:\nThere is music blasting from Ayoola\u2019s room. She is listening to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody.\u201d It would be more appropriate to play Brymo or Lourde, something solemn or yearning, rather than the musical equivalent of a pack of M&Ms.\n\tThis novel is fully current, with narrative tools and chapter titles like \u201cInstagram.\u201d Ayoola is addicted to SnapChat and Instagram, often being scolded by Korede for posting frivolous updates for her followers when she\u2019s supposed to be mourning her missing boyfriend, whom she herself has killed. Ayoola has forgotten, just that quickly about the fallen men and goes on with her life in a way that baffles her sister \u2013 enter The Comedy. \tSo, while I wished that My Sister, the Serial Killer was better built out as a narrative, there is merit to it as a quick, amusing little read. It all comes down to what you\u2019re looking for on your TBR. If you\u2019re interested in a narrative set in Nigeria, this may be a great pick for you. If you\u2019re looking for lightness and humor, a read you can breeze through easily that still offers some suspense, then you\u2019ve absolutely come to the right place. But, if you\u2019re more in the market for a side of intellectual stimulation with your killer thriller, then you may want to side step this one; you want find a lot of that here. 3 stars. ***I received an advance-read copy of this book from the publisher, Doubleday, via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.FOLLOW ME AT: Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Get a Copy of My Book | Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me ", "4.5 stars\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s because she is beautiful, you know.

But then she stabbed him twice more to be sure. He sank to the floor. She could hear her own breathing and nothing else.\n\nA line like that is enough to grip the reader and their attention into a disturbing read of a serial killer and her sister. Being transported to Nigeria, where the sister of a nurse has just called her letting her know she has killed another one of her boyfriends is, without a doubt, something disturbing I would be up for reading. Unfortunately, the plot of that took a different turn and did not live to its praise. I strongly feel like I'm on the minority here, but the author did not manage to make me laugh at the \"humor\" and I did not find anything disturbing, besides the beginning. Oyinkan Braithwaite starts off the book in an effective way. We meet Korede, who is a nurse, caring for her patients, in charge of other nurses, and is pretty fond of cleaning up after the mess of her sister, who has killed two of her boyfriends. When she is interrupted one night by her sister, she knows what it's about: her sister has killed another boyfriend, Femi. She didn't know much about him, besides the fact that he wrote poetry and was with Korede's sister, Ayoola, for one month. Korede is, of course, on her way to her sister to clean up the mess. With the practice she had with Ayoola's other boyfriends, Korede can dispose of the body of Femi, clean up the room, and make it seem like nothing ever happened for there to be no suspicion. Set up with bleach, gloves, soap, brushes, and other equipment, Korede wants her sister to stop, but she's her sister, after all, so she needs to lean on her side. That is until Ayoola begins a relationship with the doctor Korede herself has had a crush on for a long time.See, Ayoola and Korede are dramatically different. Ayoola is flirtatious, witty, and is known as the beauty of the family, and she knows it. She can walk into a room where everyone will lay their eyes on her, whereas Korede is more dedicated to her work, has not been in a relationship, and is not like her sister: curvaceous with luscious hair, getting what she wants when she wants it. When Tade asks Ayoola for her sister's number, she can't feel anything but anger and jealousy. As she tries her best to hide it, she fakes her happiness and smiles, and although sometimes her rudeness is apparent, she continues her work as a nurse, even when the most unexpected turn of events come into play. Unknown who to talk to, Korede feels close to a patient who has been in a coma for a very long time now, expected to die one day. His family has not visited him in a long time, so Korede feels like its right for her to care for him since no one else will. Although this patient is in a coma, Korede didn't expect him to remember everything she has told him, including the darkest secret she is hiding from everyone. \n\nThe most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on their faces. they force us to destroy the person we really are: a subtle kind of murder.\n\nOyinkan Braithwaite started the novel strongly. The title itself is exciting and something a thriller fan would want to pick up. On another note, there are a few tiny things I can point out that Oyinkan did well. For example, although the novel is very short, little, and each chapter's pacing is quick, she gives us enough information to understand the reasons behind the actions of both sisters, Ayoola and Korede. Through flashbacks and memories recalled and told by Korede, we learn a little about how their father was, what their mother went through, and how all three survived those tough times. Some of Ayoola's actions such as being flirty and a selfish beauty at times, we learn that she became like this due to some of the trauma she received when she was little. Korede, on the other hand, always helped her sister and looked out for her, which is why she always feels like she needs to be the older sister.I personally think the author did a good job of portraying the flaws of the family, especially the sisters. When you have a sibling, the moments of comparison always rise. Personally, I would always follow my brother, being a little follower and helper, always looking up to him. I thought he was the greatest and smartest person out there. Ayoola and Korede are like this, and it's shown a lot. Korede constantly gets jealous and angry, and that is something that is common around siblings. Aside from Korede, it was also obvious that Ayoola needed her sister, and not only to clean up her mess. Although Ayoola's personality got in my nerves a lot, I can see why else she would need her older sister. She was the younger one, but she was also being saved by Korede, and she would always be the one blamed for everything. With that being said, this was the only thing I actually liked about the book. Although there are a couple of other things I didn't like, related to the sisters, the flaws felt real and refreshing, especially because we got to see why this family is basically unable to communicate with each other. The book is labeled as a disturbing thriller, but there is nothing thrilling nor disturbing in this. It felt like I was just reading out of pure boredom. Said to be disturbing, the novel does nothing but disturb you in the beginning. The title and synopsis can also be quite misleading. We know that Ayoola has killed before, and when she calls her sister for help, we know that this is her third boyfriend that she has killed. Not to be a violent person, but after reading that, I really thought there was going to be more violence. I really thought Ayoola was going to be a serial killer/assassin/murderer. I think the fantasy has gotten to me...\n\nFemi makes three, you know. Three and they label you a serial killer\n\nI think what bothered me the most from this was how I thought this would be a thriller, but there is nothing teeth-shattering and fist-clenching about My Sister, the Serial Killer. I didn't get it, didn't get the satire, the dark humor, the psychological emotions, and feelings. I didn't feel anything towards anyone or anything besides neutrality. In fact, I'm confused as to what about this is actually funny and satirical. Perhaps I missed it after reading out of pure boredom when I was trying to just finish this.All characters made it to the point where I was actually fist-clenching and teeth-shattering because of how bored and uninterested I was in everything. Both sisters are selfish because they both cared about themselves only. Although it may not seem that way on Korede's perspective, it's noted when she gets angry and jealous over the fact that her sister has begun dating the man she's in love with. On the other hand, Ayoola would only call Korede when she needed her help, show up to her work when she was working, and would always bother her even when it was obvious that Korede wanted nothing from her. The other characters, well, the only one I liked what Muhtar. He was in a coma, but his brain was still proceeding, so he remembered everything that Korede told him. He was sweet, sympathetic and kept her and her sister's secret safe. It was sad to see that the only person who truly cared for him was Korede since his family was also selfish, as they only cared about themselves. Tade was only interested in Ayoola because she was \"so beautiful\" and that made her special. The mother also praised Ayoola too much, lying, wishing for Tade and Ayoola to get married already. Information from the nurses and workers was unknown, but from what is known, they were all lazy and unproductive compared to Korede.After all the events, I wish Korede would have had some character development. I wish she had sided with herself instead of her sister. The whole Older sisters look up for their younger sisters was utter bullshit, and I had hoped Korede would have seen that. In the end, Korede made a decision that I think she should have thought through, and I mean, through.I understand now that My Sister, the Killer is more about sisterhood and who should believe who, but I wish there was more to it. 226 pages were not enough, and the small chapters didn't make it any different. Although this was not something I usually read, I was hoping it would get me on the track of reading something similar, but it failed in doing everything it promised: humoring and shocking me. \n\nShe cries for her youth, her missed opportunities and her limited options. She does not cry for me, she cries for herself.\n\n", "Now, that\u2019s what I call a damn good story!Wow. Where do I even start? Firstly, the story, coupled with the setting, alongside the characters, all resonate at a level only a fellow Nigerian would understand. Besides all that, the plot itself is unique, the prose is crisp and evocative; the characters, multilayered. Then there\u2019s that dry sardonic humour that Braithwaite sprinkles throughout the story that made me cackle out loud where I probably should have been appalled. Additionally, what Braithwaite does with the titular characters - the ditzy yet extremely manipulative \u201cserial killer\u201d- Ayoola, and her long-suffering, perpetually angsty sister- Korede, is nothing short of magical. Love, love, love!", "Set in Nigeria, My Sister, the Serial Killer follows dependable Korede and her younger sister, Ayoola, who - oops - occasionally murders people. Braithwaite's debut ranges from wry and macabre to predicable and stale. She lures her audience with two striking opening lines, and the first few chapters promise a sinster tale of deadpan humor and sly coverups, but the book quickly succumbs to familiar tropes: the beautiful, can-do-nothing-wrong younger sister and the older, less attractive sibling bearing the brunt of responsibility; a woman so beautiful men just want to  be with her; and two women fighting over the same man. Aside from taking a satirical approach to murder, there's nothing subersive about this book. Its a tale of performing unspeakable acts in the name of self-preservation and sisterhood whose twists and conclusion are forseeable; however, it's a quick read with occasional hints of humor. My Sister, the Serial Killer is best approached as a small snack for an amusing afternoon; the kind of book one should check out from the library, swallow in two bites, and promptly return. \nI bet you didn't know that bleach masks the smell of blood. Most people use bleach indiscriminately, assuming it is a catchall product, never taking the time to read the list of ingredients on the back, never taking the time to return to the recently wiped surface to take a closer look. Bleach will disinfect, but it's not great for cleaning residue, so I use it only after I have first scrubbed the bathroom of all traces of life, and death.\n", "\"I can't pinpoint the exact moment I realized that Ayoola was beautiful and I was...not. But what I do know is that I was aware of my own inadequacies long before.\"Korede is a nurse in Nigeria, dedicated to her patients and well-respected by her superiors. But no matter what her achievements are, she knows she'll always play second fiddle to her younger sister, Ayoola. Ayoola is the pretty one, the favorite\u2014and she's a psychotic murderer.One night Ayoola summons Korede to her boyfriend's house. Ayoola says he attacked her and in self-defense, she stabbed him. It doesn't matter what the facts really are\u2014who would disbelieve Ayoola? Korede is the sensible one, the calm one, the logical one who takes charge of the situation. She knows how to clean up the blood so no traces are found. She knows how to get rid of the body. It seems she has had a great deal of practice with this sort of thing, since this is the third boyfriend Ayoola has killed.\"Femi makes three, you know. Three and they label you a serial killer.\"Ayoola isn't the slightest bit remorseful about what happened. She's ready to move on, find another man to charm. Korede thinks she should lie low for a while, even though she knows it won't be long before Ayoola bats her eyes and more men will come running. But this time Ayoola sets her sights a bit closer to home, as she alights on Tade, a handsome, kind doctor Korede works with. He's also the doctor that Korede has been secretly in love with, but she knows she's no match for Ayoola's charms.As Korede watches Ayoola ensnare Tade, she feels powerless and frustrated. What she wants more than anything is just to reveal her sister's nefarious side, but she knows Ayoola will turn the evidence against her. She wishes she could just escape this life, but she has an obligation to protect her sister. With no one to turn to, she vents her anger and fears to the only person who will listen\u2014a patient who has been in a comatose state for years. But she knows all too well what will happen if she doesn't stop it.\"I am the older sister\u2014I am responsible for Ayoola. That's how it has always been. Ayoola would break a glass, and I would receive the blame for giving her the drink. Ayoola would fail a class, and I would be blamed for not coaching her. Ayoola would take an apple and leave the store without paying for it, and I would be blamed for letting her get hungry.\"\nMy Sister, the Serial Killer\n is a darkly funny yet disturbing story of familial obligation. It packs a powerful punch for a book that is less than 300 pages long, and that is because Oyinkan Braithwaite has created two complex, fascinating, not necessarily likable characters. You get glimpses of family history in order to understand where Ayoola developed her murderous tendencies. You both feel for Korede and want to shake her for allowing herself to be so fully manipulated. More than that, however, you'll want to know how this book ends. I had lots of suspicions and wasn't disappointed where Braithwaite took her story. It's certainly a troubling book about a woman so fully overshadowed by her sister that she's forced down a path she never would have taken, but it's also commentary on how unfairly women are compared to one another, with the most attractive one almost always winning out.I really enjoyed this, and read the entire book in a day. It certainly is a bit farcical, yet at the same time, you could believe this actually might happen, particularly in a society that treats women as second-class citizens. Braithwaite's storytelling was dead-on (no pun intended), and I look forward to seeing what comes next for her career.

This is at it\u2019s heart a story about two sisters, Korede and Ayoola. Korede is pragmatic, level headed and sensible. Her sister Ayoola, is none of these things. Ayoola is rash, beautiful, vibrant, the favored child and deeply irresponsible. Oh, also \u2013 did I mention she\u2019s a sociopath? Yeah, well that too. This story takes place in Braithwaite\u2019s birthplace of Nigera and follows these two sisters through a series of situations Ayoola thrusts them into.You\u2019re a big sister now, Korede. And big sisters look after little sisters.You see, while Korede loves her sister and protects her, things get a little out of hand as Ayoola continues to make choices that leaves Korede having to clean up her messes\u2026literally and figuratively. Korede is a nurse, and above all her practicality is the sisters saving grace. She knows all the best ways to clean up blood, her trunk is big enough to fit a body and not only that but when Ayoola wants to do crazy stuff, like posting pictures of her food when she should be mourning her dead boyfriend, she stops her from that too. Korede is a good sister, if covering up your siblings murders is what makes you a good sibling.However, things change when Korede\u2019s long time crush \u2013 a kind, handsome doctor who works at her hospital, Tade, asks Korede not for her number, but for Ayoola\u2019s. Ayoola has shown no remorse for her actions, she\u2019s simply moved on and is keen to get over her dead ex, by getting under some one new. As Korede stands helplessly by, watching Ayoola seduce Tade with her charisma, charm and beauty she struggles with her wish to leave this life and her obligation to look out for her sister. Korede, having no one to confide in, turns to a comatose patient and she grapples with the knowledge that if she does nothing \u2013 she is well aware of what the outcome of this new relationship will be.It takes a whole lot longer to dispose of a body than to dispose of a soul, especially if you don\u2019t want to leave any evidence of foul play. This was quite a different type of story than I anticipated when I first added it to my TBR and when I first started reading it. At just 226 pages, this baby packs a serious punch. Not only that, but as Braithwaite\u2019s debut novel I am left feeling incredibly impressed by the skill and finesse shown in weaving this story. The layered characters she created were fresh and vibrantly written \u2013 most notably Korede. Braithwaite wrote Korede in a way that you could deeply feel for her plight \u2013 especially if you know the bonds of siblings \u2013 but at the same time, I regularly found myself wanting to shake Korede as hard as I can and yell in her face \u201cWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, GIRL, THIS DUMB!\u201d. This also had a very dark, campy humor that I found utterly refreshing.Ayoola has her knife on her, since she carries it the way other women carry tampons.In the end, I adored this story and am excited for future works by Braithwaite. However, there were a few things that left me wanting, just a bit. First, the chapters are very choppy. This is a short book, and I absolutely flew through it, but I wish the read had been a little more fluid and less jerky. While I appreciated the social commentary on societies obsession with beauty (especially since beauty, in general is fleeting and society equates beauty and youth) it did get a little tedious to focus on so much. I wish there had been just a bit more depth to their differences, instead of focusing so much on appearance. The ending quite surprised me, which I\u2019ve found rare these days but I also wish this aspect had been fleshed out just a bit more. All in all, I think this is definitely one to add to your list, or read it if it\u2019s already there!", "4.5* rounded up. I discovered this novel by accident while I was browsing the longlist for Orange Women Prize. I had no intention to read any of the proposed books since this year I don't feel I have the time to follow awards but the title immediately caught my eye. After reading the blurb I just knew I had to buy it and I left everything else I had started for this one. I am so glad I did because it was such a pleasant surprise. I should let myself carried away by my instincts more often. What is it about except the obvious, a sister who is a serial killer? Well, I think one of the main questions that I was left with is: Is the enabler as guilty as the perpetrator? In my opinion, yes, but you should make up your own mind. It is also a novel about loyalty and its limits, family dynamics and loveKorede, a plain woman, is a nurse at a hospital in Lagos. Her sister, Ayoola is a local beauty, a fashion designer and a serial killer of her boyfriends. Whenever she murders another boo in \"self defence\" she calls her hygiene obsessed sister to help her clean up the mess. Korede has some issues with her conscience but when her boss (to whom she is in love) falls for Ayoola, things become more complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s because she is beautiful, you know. That\u2019s all it is. They don\u2019t really care about the rest of it. She gets a pass at life.\u201dAlthough the story is structured in very short chapters and the writing style is clean and simple I was impacted by the structure. The story alternated between the present and the narration of the family history which might or might not explain Ayoola's behaviour.There are some subtle tones of dark humour, my favourite kind, so this novel was right up my alley. \u201cThe most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on their faces. They force us to destroy the person we really are: a subtle kind of murder.\u201d ", "**3.5-stars rounded up**A unique novella following the perspective of a young woman, Korede, living in Lagos, Nigeria.Korede is a nurse and seems to lead a fairly normal life; she is on the straight and narrow, if you will. Normal, until you discover that Korede's younger sister, Ayoola, kills all of her boyfriends and then Korede cleans up the mess.\"You're a big sister now, Korede. And big sisters look after little sisters.\" Apparently, this is the sentiment Korede was raised with and now, no matter what her sister does, she feels obligated to PROTECT HER from everything. Protect her?!? The witch is crazy. She shows no remorse or empathy for the things she does. At one point, Korede muses, \"I am more haunted by her actions than she is.\" Yeah, no kidding!I did fluctuate throughout the story between feeling bad for Korede for all the bullshit she had to put up with and being angry at her for not standing up to her damn sister.Ultimately, I wish it would have gone a different way. I really was hoping Korede would make more growth as a character and fight back against the way people treated her.This is a novella though, very short, and I just don't think there was enough time for her character to get there.Overall, I felt the story was compelling, it definitely kept me interested and was unique. Thank you to the publisher, Doubleday Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I always appreciate the opportunity and I know a lot of people will enjoy this little tale. Personally, I look forward to seeing what comes next from Braithwaite. I like her style!", "This book reads like a bowl of popcorn. Fresh, light, hot and salty. Each very short chapter going down with a crunch, my hand already reaching greedily into the bowl for the next. It's so very easy to read - but it contains complexity that satisfies. All at once it is mysterious, funny, disturbing. The current of feminism-gone-awry runs through it. Family ties that strangle. Korede is the responsible sister. Ayoola is the serial killer. She's the perfect black widow, beautiful and charming. She lures men into her web and then punishes them for their stupidity. Korede cleans up the mess. But for how long?I admire the way that this author walked the tightrope of satire, keeping the story from slipping into genre or farce. At no point does the reader feel comfortable or vindicated by the murders. In fact, we are disturbed - the victims are intelligent, kind, talented, nothing like a \"Dexter\" approved prey. But at the same time, Braithwaite's killer embodies a woman who is completely empowered. The opposite of victim. And that is something quite fascinating to see. An excellent debut by Nigerian author Oyinkan Braithwaite. Can't wait to see what she writes next.", "\n3.5 stars. I was hooked from the beginning of this book and loved the subtle, dark humor ingrained in Braithwaite's writing. I found the characters and sister dynamic to be super compelling, which incentivized me to read the rest of the story pretty quickly. Halfway through the book though, my interest started dwindling as the narrative ended up pretty straightforward. I wish there was more development with the plot points and relationships; this would have made the ending a lot punchier.\n", "FIVE STARS I LOVE THIS!!\u201cFemi makes three, you know. Three and they label you a serial killer.\u201dOk, truth here--this is not a suspenseful thriller, despite the enticing title. It IS a novel about family dynamics, love between sisters and loyalty to the ones that matter in your life. The minute I started this short, richly dark and funny book, I was HOOKED! It is elegant and lovely, all gorgeous words on a page. Set in Nigeria, very up-to-the-minute contemporary, and oh so addictive! The story centers around a beautiful 20-something that is so alluring, every man falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately for them, our pretty girl tends to murder the man after she grows tired of him. Her older sister is the slightly bitter one, responsible with a full time job and a neatnik cleaning fetish. This comes in handy since her little sis calls her after every murder to help clean up and dispose of the body.DOES THIS SOUND CRAZY???? Yes, it is. And like I said, I love it!! I don't think it is for everyone, but if you are open-minded and adventurous in your reading, I highly recommend it! It is actually a very sweet story with just a bit of a sting.The audio version is superb. I could listen to that gorgeous Nigerian accent all day long!", "An unusual, fabulous, short, but cracking read from Oyinkan Braithwaite, at the heart of which is the dysfunctional relationship between two sisters set in Nigeria. In this entertaining, satirical and fun story, Korede is the elder sister, living under the shadow of her beautiful, selfish, murdering psycho of a younger sister, Ayoola, with men who flock towards her, finding her just so unbelievably irresistible. Korede, as a nurse has the skills to clean up after her serial killer of a sister's murders, she harbours resentment and ambivalent feelings towards Ayoola, but when all is said and done, she is family, blood is thicker, so her loyalties lie with Ayoola. With Korede unburdening herself on a coma patient, what happens when family loyalties are tested against the feelings Korede has for a doctor? A darkly humorous novel that is compulsive, engaging and riveting reading. Many thanks to Atlantic Books for a copy of the book. ", "If you appreciate dark humor with a side of social commentary this is the book for you!  The novel is set in the author\u2019s birthplace of Nigeria, and follows two sisters, Ayoola and Korede. Ayoola is beautiful, irresponsible, and has a habit of killing off her boyfriends. Korede is the older, less attractive sister who literally cleans up the messes her sister makes and protects her at all costs. Ayoola lacks self-awareness and goes about her life being adored and indulged due to her great beauty. As the eldest, Korede is loyal but underneath she harbors feelings of anger and resentment, which reveals itself in surprising ways.  But what happens when Ayoola sets her sights on a man that Korede has feelings for? This is when things really get interesting. There is a backstory that helps to explain why Ayoola and her sister are the way they are, but the first-person narrative by Korede prevents us from delving too deeply into Ayoola\u2019s psyche. It would have been nice to know more from other character\u2019s perspectives.  At 240 pages, it's a quick read and the dark humor and subtle social commentary keeps this tale from becoming grim. Nothing should be taken too seriously, as it\u2019s the underlying themes that make this such a thoughtful novel. Topics such as the sibling bond, sociopathy, social media, abuse, and the role of women in a patriarchal society are explored. The book also led me to the internet to explore the Nigerian culture. I love it when a book inspires me to do my own little bit of research on a topic.  I buddy read this with my friend Marialyce and this book generated some surprisingly deep discussions. I think this would make a terrific book club discussion book.", "Hot diggety, dog diggety, oh what you do to me\u2026Oh what this book did to me!! Yes, I\u2019m singing away as I bounce along on my pogo stick. This edgy little book is a favorite of the year and yes, it made my all-time-favorites list too! Oh brother (I guess I should say, oh sister). What a fantastic read this is! Smart, dark, irresistible, and so well written! I honestly didn\u2019t want to start my next book because I wanted to keep the taste of this sweet morsel in my mouth. No thank you, I don\u2019t want to chew on any new words and wipe out the heavenly taste. I don\u2019t even want to brush my teeth (although you have to admit that wanting to keep the taste of a book in my mouth is a pretty inventive excuse for not polishing the old pearlies\u2014but don\u2019t tell my dentist).Sisters, sigh. I\u2019m an older sister who sometimes had to clean up my little sisters\u2019 messes\u2014huff, puff, \u201cthis isn\u2019t fair,\u201d I\u2019d bitch. But come on, their messes didn\u2019t include the body of a man they just stabbed to death. I had it easy. Stop your complaining.  The title tells all. One sister, beautiful and charismatic, seduces men and then stabs them to death. Like all psychopaths, she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem; she\u2019s all la-de-da and nonchalant. The ugly sister, the one telling the story, is left holding the mop. Like all normal people, she does think it\u2019s a problem; her middle name is worry. The first-person narrative makes her likeable and believable, and it also makes us feel her pain. I don\u2019t want to say anything else about what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s suspense\u2014will the killer or her cleaner-upper sister get caught? Will the beautiful sister kill again? I\u2019ll just say that the book is about all things sibling: rivalry, jealousy, loyalty, love. I was instantly in love with the title; it\u2019s irresistible. But the cover, not so much. It\u2019s too neon-y, like underneath the cover it\u2019s all trashy. The brash colors hurt my eyes. And please, remember lowercase! (Some old editor guidelines said to kill All Caps, that they\u2019re harder to read. And I\u2019m stuck believing it; too many years of obedience.) The book is set in Nigeria; we get a little taste of the culture, which I just loved. There very occasionally is a sentence in the native language. Usually I don\u2019t like sentences that I can\u2019t understand, but here, I didn\u2019t care one iota. It just reminded me that the story takes place in a far-away culture. Funny how love of a book can make me ignore what typically would be a complaint.In a slight way, this book reminds me of books by Koch, one of my favorite authors. (Dear Mr. M comes to mind.) This book is less complex and less dense, but both Koch and this author have psychos, mysteries, psychology, dark humor, and great writing in common.One of my all-time favorite novels is Stay with Me, also by a Nigerian author and also set in Nigeria. Check it out if you want another great read from Nigeria.  Thanks to Betsy for her review, which made this a Must Read Now book. And oh what a book this is. It\u2019s a fast read and thoroughly engaging, and it had me bouncing on my pogo stick for days. I\u2019m dying to see what this author does next. Highly recommended.", "Well, I think you kind of have to be ok with somewhat rooting for the doormat sister of a serial killer, who (quite literally) cleans up her messes for her.That? <--won't be for everyone.Most serial killers that we know about are predominately white and male, which is one of the things that makes it easier for the stunningly lovely Ayoola to go about her business, happily stabbing away.But her sister, Korede, knows. Or at the very least, she suspects that it is very unlikely her little sister is acting in self-defense anymore when she calls her to help clean up yet another dead boyfriend.So what will faithful Korde do when the kind doctor with the beautiful voice (that's she's secretly been in love with forever) decides to ask Ayoola out on a date?I really enjoyed the way the girls' past opens up to you over the course of the story, and the way my feelings for Korde's crush changed during that time. It all worked out for the best, I felt.Warning:Those readers with a strong sense of right and wrong- the ones with no real moral ambiguity? You know who you are.You probably won't like this. I personally enjoyed it quite a bit.Adepero Oduye - NarratorPublisher: Penguin Random House Audio Publishing GroupEdition: Unabridged", "4 Strong StarsI really enjoyed this story; but, most of all, I enjoyed the writing. Many people probably believe that longer sentences and flowery prose is the sign of good writing. And sometimes it is; however, I am always more impressed by writers who can write concisely and without any fat. In many ways, it's actually harder to write with such brevity. To have each word and sentence be meaningful and without filler or bullshit. To have what is not there have even more impact than what is. Braithwaite is definitely a true talent. This book was a lean, mean, machine and I enjoyed every minute of it. I enjoyed the Nigerian setting and culture, the characters, the humor, and most of all, the thought-provoking undercurrents of all the things in life we should question: Loyalty.Social media.Perception.Family.Love.Morality.And perhaps above all, beauty.", "How could you not be interested in this one? The title, the cover, the subject matter. I was sold immediately. I got the audio, rather quickly too from my library, and jumped right in.Two sisters. One a nurse, one a psychopathic serial killer. Korede works hard as a nurse. She is very frustrated, to say the least, with her sister. Her sister, Ayoola, is beautiful, she stops men in their tracks. Though, she is quite aloof. Men practically throw themselves at her. But....she's crazy and kills them on what seems like a whim. Is Korede jealous of her sister? Is she protective of her being the older sister? Perhaps a bit of both. But Ayoola keeps killing these men and asking her sister for help cleaning up her mess. You have to wonder if they are the way they are due to the abuse they suffered. Or are they both are just certifiable? It's quite the story, learning of the strong bonds of sisterhood.It's odd....but I really liked this one. I liked the sisters. The way the story is told, they seem like OK girls. Well, except for the whole murder/covering up thing. The chapters were short. Some, very short, perhaps a page or less. The story was told from the point of view of Korede. I listened to the audio and really enjoyed the narration. I was drawn in and did not want to stop. If anything, I wanted to hear more. Find out more of how the story of these two played out. A great read if your looking for something quick, strange, and a bit unique. Looking forward to more from this author!", "4**\"You're a big sister now, Korede. And big sisters look after little sisters.\"Korede: nurse, responsible, plain, big sister.... and a meticulous cleaner. Ayoola: flirtatious, beautiful, reckless, selfish, a manipulator of men.... and a serial killer.Ayoola has killed before and each time, Korede has been there to clean it up. After the third kill, Korede wonders whether her sister did kill all these men in self-defense... but of course, she's the younger sister, of course it would be in self-defense, Korede needs to protect her younger sister in case the reasons for these crimes are misconstrued in court. However, one day, when Ayoola visits Korede at work, Ayoola takes an interest in the handsome Doctor Tade, someone who Korede fancies and knows all too well what happens to the men her sister dates. Stuck in a moral dilemma, Korede must decide whether to protect the one she liked or her blood. This was a story of a moral dilemma's, thrown in with a dysfunctional family and the occasional occurrence of fatalities. This was also a story of sisterhood, examining the sisterly bond and how far one will go to protect the other. It also shows the jealousies and differences between the sisters and how they are approached and treated differently by other people, especially the differences in treatment style by their mother.I thought this book was so interesting, being set in Lagos, it shows how these character's are trying to move against a society, and a traditional family, that expects women to conform to one traditional role; that is, to aspire to marriage and have children.In addition, the author makes good use of today's technology and social platforms, easily relating the story to today's culture.This book felt pulpy, witty and humourous in a black comedy kind of way. This was not a long book with only 200+ pages, but it was utterly unputdownable. The short chapters also aided in the impactfulness of the story.", "\nCampy, weird, and off-beat\nI've struggled with how to review this oddly addictive book. I listened to the Audible version and the narrator was really enjoyable.\u00a0 Her Nigerian accent added to the allure of the sister bond that was built into the plot and I loved how she pronounced their names, Korede and Ayoola.It isn't so much about Ayoola's little problem of killing her boyfriends, but more about the relationship of the two sisters and how she dealt with her in many wild situations. Korede is a nurse and ends up\u00a0cleaning up\u00a0after her sister.\u00a0 Ayoola is the beautiful one and perhaps Korede is a bit jealous, but she feels a deep need to \"protect\" her little sister.Things get complicated when a handsome doctor named Tade has his eyes on Ayoola.\u00a0 Korede wants to \"warn\" him about what may be in store for him.I did enjoy listening to this one, although it seemed a bit short and left me wanting more of a conclusion.I'm giving this 3.5 STARS rounded up to 4 for the intriguing narration!", "Nifty debut novel for Braithwaite - and love that crazy book cover!Korede and Ayoola are sisters in Lagos, Nigeria. Korede is the older sister; sensible, practical, plain. Ayoola is the younger sister; flighty, charming, spectacularly beautiful. Ayoola has an unfortunate habit of murdering her admirers and depends on Korede to help her conceal her crimes. Only Ayoola doesn\u2019t think of them as crimes, because Ayoola is a narcissistic sociopath. When Ayoola sets her sights on Korede\u2019s secret crush, Tade, Korede has to decide if she will continue to protect her sister\u2019s secret.Very well written, with sharp insight into the characters. This is a winner and a quick, riveting read. Highly recommend!", "\nMaybe more of a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to a 4 because I really enjoyed this! It wasn't quite as thrilling as I expected it to be, but I think that has more to do with the marketing than with the book itself. This was really unlike anything else I've ever read and I cannot wait to hopefully read more from Braithwaite in the future.\n", "\n1 star ! 2019 Read I was Most Afraid to Hate Award I found this mostly repulsive. In what kind of world is serial killing and psychopathy funny ?A feminist satire...my arse ! The one star is for the very interesting cultural and social setting.\n", "This book is a complete gem and I enjoyed every moment I spent with Korede and Ayoola! Firstly, I have never read a book that took place in Africa...Lagos Nigeria to be precise and it made this book much more interesting for me. Korede and Ayoola are sisters. Korede is the sensible one that makes her living as a nurse and also cleaning up after her sister Ayoola. Ayoola is flighty, addicted to social media, but mostly Ayoola is beautiful. No man can seem to resist her charm. Or, better yet, her appearance. The thing is that Ayoola bores of her men quickly and when she's done with you she is DONE with you and she may even get a little stabby to prove her point. When Ayoola has these moments of murderous intentions it is Korede to who she calls to help. The always efficient Korede comes to save her time and time again. But what happens when Ayoola sets her sights on the doctor that Korede is infatuated with? You'll have to read it to find out. Oyinkan Braithwaite, I adore you and your humor. You made these characters come alive. And THAT COVER is perfection! I'd like to frame it and hang it in my house. My only gripe is the ending. It was very abrupt and I'm going to spoiler tag this (view spoiler)[WHO IS THE GUY AT THE VERY END? Another of Ayoola's conquests? Was it Muhtar? I wasn't quite clear on this. (hide spoiler)] 4 stab worthy stars! Thank you to NetGalley and Doubleday Books for proving me with a digital ARC in exchange for my honest review. ", "This is the story of a woman in love with a man in love with her sister, a serial killer. If that sentence alone doesn\u2019t make you want to go, ''Ooooohhhh\u2026 intriguing,'' then please do stop reading this review. My heart won\u2019t break.This is quick and short and predictable but also very exciting, mysterious, thrilling. I have read books about serial killers before\u2014would any mystery fan dare claim otherwise?\u2014but never about a gorgeous, fun and na\u00efve murderess you can\u2019t help but want to believe is innocent.Her sister, Korede, older, wiser and more disciplined, also wants to believe that Ayoola is only protecting herself by killing all those men. But the moment Ayoola goes after the man she loves, she becomes less and less inclined to make excuses for her sister\u2019s dark tendencies. The interactions between the two sisters\u2014their bickering especially\u2014are entertaining. As is Korede\u2019s dry humour. The story is told from her perspective so we are in her head the whole time and are direct witnesses to her dilemma: take Ayoola\u2019s side, always, or bring her to justice! Family is an important theme, as is the idea of women supporting one another in this world filled with men who take what they want without hesitation. If this wasn\u2019t a fictional story, I would disapprove of the ending\u2014because wow!\u2014but it was a bold move on the author\u2019s part. And I love bold moves so I approve, ha! Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "3.5 starsHonestly, this book immediately drew me in, and has been rolling around in my head since its completion. Yes, it deals with two sisters, and yes, one of them is a serial killer. However, there is something alluring, something so sinister, and something that draws you through this short book to a conclusion that was totally bizarre, perhaps not understandable, and yet seemed to utterly fit.Ayoola, the younger sister has a penchant for killing her boyfriends, while big sister Koreed, has a penchant for covering up for her sister and protecting her knowing full well what she is. The ironic part is that other than protecting a murderess, Koreed is a nurse supposedly dedicated to preserving life. Yet, her sister takes precedence in Koreed's mind and heart and as her sister seems to be heading to more boyfriends's demises, Koreed stays firmly in her corner.This was such an interesting character study. One sister is crazy and the other one is not far behind, probably even crazier. The girls, whose father was abusive, seem to have coped with him in their own way, though Ayoola, the beautiful one, seems to be forgiven all her mistakes and is the sister some will \"die\" to love. Koreed, the ugly sister, stays in the background, the unloved, the unwanted, and yet she is the one who sallies forth always in defense of what most would categorize as the indefensible. Can this be love? The obvious question is how far would you go to protect the one you love? Would you venture into a world of murder to insulate the one you love from being brought to justice? Or would you just let the bodies add up, knowing that you yourself could stop this at any time.This was a buddy read with Jan.

I didn't find it funny, as other readers did, but it was light... and that's special (in a good way), considering the dark subject.

I've rewritten large parts of it for clarity. The main idea remains the same.\nExtremist Judeo-Christian beliefs have won America's culture war. Now women have no rights. They are slaves to men and the biblical, patriarchal society in which they live. The Handmaid's Tale is the first-person account of one of these enslaved women.Massachusetts Turns Into Saudi Arabia?More than thirty years have passed since The Handmaid's Tale was first published in 1985, but many still think of it as the go-to book for feminist fiction. It makes numerous \"best of\" lists, the kinds with 99 other books everyone should read before dying. Even so, The Handmaid's Tale frustrates me a lot\u2014and not only because it contains run-on sentences and needlessly abandons quotation marks. (This is no train wreck like Jos\u00e9 Saramago's Blindness, but it's bad enough.) Simply put, if you can ignore whether you agree or disagree with Margaret Atwood's ideas about politics, religion, and women's rights, the plot and setting make no sense.The religiosity of the Reagan era inspired Atwood's dystopia, in which fundamentalist Christians have taken over society. While that premise does give me the heebie-jeebies, Atwood\u2019s taken the idea to a literal extreme to make a point. This ruins the foundation of The Handmaid's Tale because most American fundies would balk at this world. Atwood imagines the extreme of the extreme and in the process completely misunderstands American evangelicalism. I'm a heathen bastard and no fan of religion. Fundamentalism has hurt people, particularly women, for millennia. Extremism continues to hurt people every day, especially in some parts of the world, especially in some states. Even so, it's hard to accept Atwood's dystopia when it's set in the U.S., in the near future\u2014and in Massachusetts, one of the most progressive states in the country, one of only sixteen states in the union with state constitutional protections for abortion (since 1981, I believe). Massachusetts is a liberal bastion when it comes to American women's reproductive rights, so it's an odd setting for this brand of nightmare. In recent decades, Massachusetts is also one of the least religious states, so it's an odd setting for a theocracy, too.Atwood chose Massachusetts for its puritanical history. I can embrace the connection to the Reagan administration, in the same way I can embrace Orwell's fear of communism in 1984, but to imagine an unchanging, puritanical Massachusetts requires a bit too much. Societies Don't Change OvernightThe Handmaid's Tale is told in first person by a woman who\u2019s lived in our present day (more or less), as well as in this dark fundamentalist Tomorrowland. She\u2019s gone from wearing flip-flops and sundresses to a full-body religious habit, color-coded red to match her subservient role. She was married once, had a child. Now she\u2019s another\u2019s property, one of the handmaids sent from one man\u2019s house to another. The hope is that she will become pregnant when a prominent man\u2019s wife cannot. Her life has been flipped and made forfeit. She lives in fear and depression and abuse. This is meant to make me unnerved, and it does.But.Simply because an author wants to comment on society doesn\u2019t mean he or she can ignore important, logical story elements. The logic part should be emphasized here, I think, given this is supposed to be science fiction, not fantasy. (Although Atwood does insist The Handmaid's Tale is speculative fiction, because that further legitimizes her story...or something? Never mind that sci-fi and fantasy are types of speculative fiction.)There\u2019s a question I have that never gets answered, not properly at least. How did this happen so quickly? How did we go from \"burning bras\" to having every part of our lives regulated? Why did it take Massachusetts decades, centuries, to reject puritanism, but only a few years(?) to reject liberalism?Rights can erode, but you don\u2019t see it happen on such a large scale and so seamlessly, and not overnight. Nothing happens overnight, especially not governmental takeovers in relatively stable, secular societies, which is the book's scenario. Societies evolve, one way or another, usually rather slowly. Civil, moral, and regime changes don't sneak up on you. It wasn't the case in Germany before Hitler, in China before Mao, in Afghanistan before the Taliban, in Syria before its civil war. It's not the case in 2016, with people like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump leading in GOP primary polls. The world may be disappointing and horrible sometimes, but it is rarely surprising.If Atwood had built her dystopia on a chain of events that occurred over a longer period of time, or explained how everything unraveled so quickly, I might have been on board with the premise. That isn't how The Handmaid's Tale is written, though. The explanations for the sudden changes are fantastical, at best, dependent on evil, digitized money\u2014be careful with the mobile payments and bitcoins, ladies!\u2014and misogynistic, conservative conspiracies that readers are to believe could bring millions of people to a stupefied halt and change culture in the blink of an eye. (view spoiler)[Apparently it\u2019s easy to gun down all of Congress while it\u2019s in session. Who knew? (hide spoiler)]I don\u2019t buy it.You can change laws all you want, but society, culture, has to be willing to follow the most drastic changes. (This is why the American Drug War has never worked, why prohibition of alcohol never worked, why banning abortion didn't work.) Why was modern American society so willing to enslave women? Atwood chucks a plot point at you here or there, hinting at a larger, more complex world through her main character. There\u2019s a vague fertility crisis (of course). There's conflict somewhere between some people about some stuff, but details are never given. Some of this can be excused, what with the limited point of view, but not all. Plot holes aren't mysterious or clever. They're just plot holes.By the end of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, I feel the book is less an exploration of religious extremism and feminism than it is a narrative written for shock value. It\u2019s an irrational feminist\u2019s fears exposed, that the world is out to get you at every turn\u2014especially the men, especially the women controlled and brainwashed by the men. Nowhere is safe. Overall, the summary for this book could be this: Almost anyone with a penis is mostly unfeeling and evil, deep down. (The rest are idiots, I suppose.) He doesn\u2019t care. He will betray you at the first opportunity. Even when you're dead and gone, he will chuckle at your misfortune and demise. No, this isn\u2019t sexist or a generalization. Of course not. Not at all.Except it is.Asides- For a slightly more accurate portrayal of American Christian fundamentalism and its very awkward relationship with women, see Hillary Jordan's \nWhen She Woke\n. It makes several nods to The Scarlet Letter and The Handmaid's Tale\u2014and better understands its villains and their behavior.- Two nonfiction books, Jenny Nordberg's \nThe Underground Girls of Kabul\n and Ned & Constance Sublette's \nThe American Slave Coast: The History of the Slave-Breeding Industry\n, will show you what it's really like to live in a society where women are chattel.- Some think that because I dislike this book I'm not a feminist, or am a bad feminist. I hate to break it to everyone, but Margaret Atwood is not feminism's god, and The Handmaid's Tale is not a religious text. If I must attach labels to myself, feminist would be one of them, and I'll say and think whatever I damn well please. And as a feminist, I hate how one-dimensional the men are in this book, just as much as I hate how one-dimensional women are in far more books, TV shows, and movies. Deal with it. Or don't. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n", "5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about \u2018life\u2019 it\u2019s about controlling women. If you can\u2019t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to \u2018in cases of rape and incest\u2019 is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you\u2019re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can\u2019t afford more, it doesn\u2019t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don\u2019t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women? My stars and garters!03/31/17. So, this Russia thing.... Am I right?2/5/17.....just another giant step towards making this book a reality, like they always dreamed of.Original review written in 2o12:WARNING: This review is being written after I worked a 13 hour day, with another one on the horizon tomorrow, and a glass of wine and while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Current events have put this book on the forefront of my mind, and damn it I got to get this out. I have never written a review on The Handmaid's Tale because I love the book, and it is so hard to write about a book you love. Ehh, what the hell.OfFred was a normal everyday woman with a career, a name, a life like all women have come to expect and take for granted in this age. When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don\u2019t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So\u2026\u2026\u2026I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2026..icky poor women. Now it\u2019s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I\u2019m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I\u2019m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote\u2026\u2026unless that\u2019s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It\u2019s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don\u2019t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it\u2019s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said\u2026 Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I\u2019m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I\u2019m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to\u2026..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the \u2018other\u2019. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don\u2019t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio\u2026.sigh) any more than a conservative want\u2019s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who\u2019s right or wrong here, I\u2019ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half\u2026HALF\u2026 the country didn\u2019t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don\u2019t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) \u201cThe advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.\u201d-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump\u2026..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is \u201ca goodly amount of both\u201d, but in this election sexism won and women lost.", "I guess Atwood doesn't believe in quotation marks.. I don't think I've ever come across a novel yet in which there is no distinction between the narrator and the character. It took me quite a while to get used to that type of style of writing. I had to go back and re-read sentences again and again, which doesn't really lend itself to a relaxing reading experience, and it slowed me down quite a bit..First 100 pages:Really annoying..why? well because I felt like a juicy bone was being waved in front of my face. Like when someone asks you, \"guess which celebrity died today?\" and you ask, \"who?\" and they say, \"well why don't you guess?\" and you answer \"I don't know, I give up, just tell me\", and this keeps going back and forth, back and forth, and finally you just want to say, \"forget it, it's not even worth it\" and walk away. That's how I felt reading this book. Kinda like Atwood was being childish about withholding the plot information because it gave her literary power and control over the reader, and keeps them hostage.Then I couldn't ignore this overwhelming feeling that the philosophy of this story was going to be something that didn't sit well with me. However, I slowly realized it was just a typical novel, with no outstanding profundity whatsoever.One of the reasons I despise contemporary literature, and basically ceased reading it years ago is because contemporary writers almost always, almost 100% of the time, revert to the all-essential shock value elements, what I like to call the \"cheap grabber\". In the back cover of \"The Handmaids Tale\", it goes on to say: \"Atwood takes many trends which exist today and stretches them to their logical and chilling....blah, blah, blahhhhhh...\" ...and let me just state that I noticed the review by Newsweek long after I had already started reading the book. It was probably noticed during one of those moments of frustration where I single-handedly flipped the book around wondering, \"whatthefuckingfuck?\".I'll give you a perfect example of how she used this \"trend\".I'm reading about women in habits, who seem to be pious and obedient, living in the Republic of Gilead. They walk with their heads bowed down, two by two whispering words to each other, such as \"blessed be\", \"may the Lord Open\" and \"I receive with joy\". And this goes on say for about 100 pages or so. Then suddenly out of the blue you read, \"He's fucking me\". Now it's not that I don't like the word \"fuck\". In fact I LOVE the word \"fuck\". Not as in \"I like to fuck\", but as in, \"Fuck, my food is burning\", or \"Fuck, I got my period on the mattress again\". So it's not like I'm a \"fuck\" prude, cause I'm not. It's just that it didn't seem to fit in with the theme of the book and it was cheaply thrown in for shock value to keep up with the \"trend\". Now can anyone sit there and tell me Atwood couldn't have better and more eloquently described that scene? Halfway through the book, I stopped and assessed what I had gotten from it so far.. still nothing.It certainly had moments of intrigue, I give it that much. Of course it had to have had intrigue because it's a pretty popular book. But Atwood's writing from the beginning is so flawed. It's as if it went straight from her hands to publishing without being proof-read or edited.I'm not a writer, but I am a reader, and I think I'm certainly capable of recognizing whether a book flows or not, and this book just doesn't flow at all. And what pisses me off the very most is that Margaret Atwood is presently supposed to represent one of Canada's top leading modern authors. Just because a book sells a lot doesn't mean squat. It's just a trend, a fad. It's like when The Philadelphia Inquirer stated that \"PUSH a novel\" might find a place in the African American Literary canon. I was like, WHAT!!?? are you kidding me? that shit? no effin way, no. Look at The Davinchi Code. Yes, I enjoyed the novel a lot, but I also recognize that Dan Brown probably won't be included as part of the American literary canon in 100 years either.Margaret Atwood, in my humble opinion is not the greatest of writers. I've seen reviewers on goodreads who are better at writing than she is.The only decent thing about this novel was the story-line, and even that seemed like Daniel Steel fluff. Oh and the other thing that got me was that the entire female democracy has fallen apart and all Of-Fred could think of was her need to have sexual intimacy with a man. Not to mention that she never seemed appropriately upset about the fact that her husband and daughter have been taken from her. Has Maragaret Atwood ever seen the Movie Red Dawn with Patrick Swayze? The wolverines? c'mon, man!!The other major problem with this novel is that there were so many questions unanswered. What political reason behind the president day massacre? Who were these people? why were women targeted? Why didn't women (and their men) fight back? Those are questions I'm asking just to humor the book. At this point, the book was so leaky that It's not even worth asking questions about, because there aren't any answers. I thought this book was going to have some psychological depth, but to me it was just like reading a cheap novel. I can go on and on about other things that make this not a great novel, but it's not even worth it.I'm extremely disappointed.. I thought this was going to be one of the good ones.Updated: I'm currently watching the Handmaids tale on Hulu, and it's one of the best shows I've ever watched aside from breaking bad.", "I\u2019ve been moved by books in the past, many times, but I\u2019ve never before read a book that has emotionally drained me to such a degree. This is frightening and powerful. And sometimes it only takes a single paragraph to make you realise how much so: \n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am, I said again, forgetting. They used to have dolls, for little girls, that would talk if you pulled a string at the back; I thought I was sounding like that, voice of a monotone, voice of a doll. She probably longed to slap my face. They can hit us, there\u2019s Scriptural precedent. But not with any implement. Only with their hands.\u201d\nNeedless to say, this is an absolutely awful situation. From the very beginning, I knew how much I was going to like this book. Its story isn\u2019t one that it is simply read: it demands to be heard. It beckoned me to see the full force of the situation. The Handmaids, the average woman, have no free will or individualism; they are treated as simple baby producing machines. An oppressive regime is forced upon them, and to deviate from the said standard results in a slow and agonising death. There\u2019s no hope or joy for them, only perpetual subjugation. Indeed, this is where Atwood\u2019s awe inspiringly persuasive powers reside. By portraying such a bleak situation, she is able to fully demonstrate what life could be like if we suddenly followed the misogynistic views of the old testament with fierce intensity. Women would have no power whatsoever. This would be reinforced by a complete cultural destruction and lack of any form of self-expression. They would not be able to read or write; they would not be able to speak their minds. It would even go as far as to condition them so powerfully, that they completely lack the ability of independent thought. And, to make it even worse, the women know no difference. Sure, the narrator of this remembers her past, but she\u2019s not allowed to. She is forced to repress any sense of individual sentiment. \n\u201cBut who can remember pain, once it\u2019s over? All that remains of it is a shadow, not in the mind even, in the flesh. Pain marks you, but too deep to see. Out of sight, out of mind.\u201d \nThe narrator has a horrendous ordeal, in an equally as horrendous world. The notion was devised as a response against a drastic decrease in birth-rates. Men in power have taken complete control of women in both body and mind to insure an increase in the declining birth-rates. As I mentioned, their individualism is repressed, but the men also prevent any physical freedom. The women are owned by the state, by the men and by corruption; their bodies are nothing more than a means to provide new life. In this, they are degraded to a state of sub-human existence; they are no longer people. Atwood suggests that they are merely a reproductive organ, one that can be discarded without thought, mercy or conscience. This is reinforced on every level; the language delivers this on a revealing scale. The names are suggestive of the oppression; the protagonist is called \u201cOffred.\u201d She is of-Fred: she belongs to him. The women are assigned names that are not their own; they are dubbed with the disgusting title of \u201cHandmaiden.\u201d By doing so they are left with very little of their former lives. The women are simply objects to be used, controlled and destroyed and the slightest hint of nonconformity to such an absurd system. But, here\u2019s the rub. The best, and most haunting, thing about this novel is its scary plausibility.The culture created is evocative of one that could actually exist. The way the men attempt to justify its existence is nothing short of terrifying. They make it sound perfectly normal. Well, not normal, but an idea that could be justified to a people. Not that it is justifiable, but the argument they present has just enough eerie resemblance to a cold, logical, response to make it seem probable in its misguided vileness. The totalitarian elements provide an image of a people that will do endure anything if they\u2019re provided with a glimpse of liberty. The small degree of liberty the Handmaids think they have doesn\u2019t actually exist: it\u2019s an illusion, a trick, a shadow on the wall. They\u2019re manipulated into believing it and become frenzied in the face of it. It is the ultimate means of control in its nastiness. \n\u201cA rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze.\u201d\nThis book was horrifying and strangely perceptive. If you\u2019re thinking about reading this, stop thinking, just read it. It\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s a book I will definitely be reading again because it is just so thought provoking and disturbing.Facebook| Twitter| Insta| Academia", "There are only a small handful of books that have affected me in a REALLY personal way. In a way that I always try to put into words and always, ultimately, fail. I have read a lot of books over the years and I've liked many, disliked plenty too, loved and hated a smaller amount... but out of the thousands I've read, there's less than ten - maybe even less than five, now I think about it - that honestly hit me so hard that I would go so far as to say they changed me.The Handmaid's Tale is a book that changed my life.I know, I know, big dramatic statement to make. I hear you. And normally I wouldn't say that, even about books I give five glowing stars; but with this book it is nothing short of the truth. This book was the spark that turned me into a feminist. It was the spark that made me interested in gender politics and, through that, politics in general. One of my favourite teachers in the world gave me this book and said \"I think you'll like this one.\"She was so wrong. I didn't like this book; I loved it. And I hated it. I lost sleep over it. I lived in it. I was so completely absorbed into this world, into this dark but oddly quiet dystopian reality. There is something about the tone of Atwood's novels that works like a knife to my heart. Quiet, rich, the drama just bubbling under the surface of the prose. Atwood doesn't waste words, she doesn't sugarcoat her stories with meaningless phrases, everything is subtle and everything is powerful.This dystopia is a well-told feminist nightmare. An horrific portrait of a future that seems far too reminiscent of aspects of our own society and its very real recent history. The best kind of dystopian fiction is, for me, that which convinces me this world might or could happen. Atwood's world-building may be sparse and built up gradually as the story unfolds, but she slowly paints a portrait of stifling oppression and injustice that had me hanging on her every word.For someone like me who was so caught up in Offred's experiences, this book was truly disturbing. In the best possible way. There are so many themes and possible interpretations that can be taken from this book - plenty of which I've literally written essays on - but I'll let new readers discover and interpret the book for themselves. I will issue you one warning, though: the ending is ambiguous and puts many people off the book. But, for me, it's one of the very few cases where an open ending has worked 100%. It made the story even more powerful, in my opinion, and guaranteed I would never be able to forget Offred and, indeed, this whole book.\n\n\u201cWe were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.\u201d \n\nBlog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr", "(edited from a paper I wrote in college about the book)In 1986, when Margaret Atwood published The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Ronald Regan had declared \u201cMorning in America,\u201d and society was going to renew itself by returning to the old values. The Christian right, in its infancy at the time, was rising in reaction to the Free Love, and the horrors of AIDs. The 1984 election gave us Willie Horton, and a reminder about how violent and evil society had become. Finally, even though Chernobyl happened shortly after the book was published, the Union Carbide disaster in Bopal, India was still fresh in the headlines\u2014a reminder that even the air is not safe. It was not hard at the time to extrapolate the ultimate end that this cocktail of fundamentalism, conservatism, violence, disease, and disaster would bring, but what Atwood could not know, is how much of her novel would become reality in the world.Amazingly, twenty years after it was written, there are elements of the story that have become true\u2014perhaps not in the United States, where the story takes place, but throughout the world. The most obvious first connection is with many of the issues regarding women\u2019s rights and religious fundamentalism that are taking place in the Middle East. It was shocking to read in the book that the initial attack on the US Government was blamed on Islamic Fundamentalists, though the story was written after the Lockerbie Pan Am bombing, and the massacre at the Rome airport. While this kind of terrorism was only in its infancy, Atwood\u2019s insight is almost prophetic in the book. When the Murrah building in Oklahoma City was bombed, the initial reaction by the media was to blame Islamic terrorists, when in fact\u2014like the novel\u2014the terrorism was homegrown. The scale of the attack that took out the US Government in the novel is also eerily similar to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Reading this novel in the post-9/11 world can send chills down one\u2019s spine: the novel includes suicide bombings at checkpoints, restrictions of rights in the name of safety, blind patriotism, and an overwhelming belief that there is only one true religion, and deviants from this should be killed.While George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is often referred to as an insightful perspective on modern society whenever someone puts a video camera on a street lamp, or the government begins referring to negative events with positive doublespeak. Orwell\u2019s world never materialized in full, and likely never will materialize to the degree he created. Instead it is Atwood\u2019s distopia, seemingly outrageous at the time it was written, that became reality. This novel should serve as a cautionary warning about the result of any extremist view taken to its logical conclusion\u2014the Taliban is proof that society cannot dismiss the notions of this book as outrageous and extreme. They have proven in the last decade, a plausible end to the error of letting fundamentalism in any form guide one\u2019s society.", "Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is a tale of terror as well as a warning. The dystopian future she describes in \"Gilead\" which appears to be centered in Boston (due to the reference to Mass Ave and the town of Salem) is chillingly misogynistic where women are reduced to strict categories: Martha for housework and cooking, Jezebels (easy to guess, right?), Eyes, Angels (soldiers for the state), infertile Wives and potentially fertile Handmaids. It is beautifully written with lots of flashbacks of \"Offred\",the protagonist's name, of how things devolved into the horrors of her present. It is disturbing because it exposes the politics of reproduction and male sexuality taken to extremes of violence that are shocking and, yet, probably seemed one possible future during the Reaganite 80s when she wrote the book and now feel like the world of which Michael Pence in particular and perhaps Paul Ryan but most definitely Steve Bannon must dream. Could things so change as quickly as she describes in the book? Let us hope not. #resistIt is certainly the most explicitly feminist dystopian book I have ever read. It was thought-provoking cover to cover.All in all, a very well-written feminist text that should serve as a clarion call for defending women's rights to maintain control over their own bodies and lives now and forever.Just found this article about my last point: hereDrumpf's sexist, violent tweet against Morning Joe and the escalating attacks against reproductive freedom are moving the American experiment dangerously towards Atwood's Gilead. #resistApparently, there are also changes at the CIA that bring the spectre of Gilead a little closer. In another note, I just got Mona Eltahawy's Headscarves and Hymens which is also on subject.Any of my review readers want to tell me whether the Hulu show about this book is worth my time or not?[UPDATE] I have watched the first two seasons of the Hulu series and am hooked. That being said, I have watched 5 episodes of S03 and been disappointed. For those who may not know, only S01 is based on the book. The other two seasons are new writing (but with Margaret Atwood supervising the writer's room).I am quite interested to know if anyone has already read the sequel that was just published in September 2019?", "Consider this not a ground-breaking work of literature. Consider this not a piece of fiction boasting an avant-garde mode of narration. Consider it not a commentary on the concept of subjugation of the weak by the ones holding the reins. Consider it not a thinly veiled feminist diatribe either.Instead, consider The Handmaid's Tale an almost physical experience. Consider Margaret Atwood a fearless deliverer of unpleasant news - a messenger unafraid of dishing out the bone-chilling, cruel, unaltered truth and nothing but the truth.Move over Bram Stoker. Move over H.P. Lovecraft. Fade away into oblivion, Edgar Allan Poe. Disappear down the depths of obscurity, Stephen King. Your narratives are not nearly as coldly brutal, your premonitions not nearly as portentous. Because Ms Atwood, presents to us something so truly disturbing in the garb of speculative fiction that it reminds one of Soviet-era accounts of quotidian hardships in Gulag labour camps. Speculative is it?Aren't the Offreds (Of Fred) , Ofglens (Of Glen), Of warrens (Of Warren) of Gilead equivalent to the Mrs So-and-So-s of the present, reduced to the identity of their male partners? Isn't the whittling down of a woman to the net worth of her reproductive organs and her outer appearance an accepted social more? Isn't blaming the rape victim, causing her to bear the burden of unwarranted shame and social stigma a familiar tactic employed by the defense attorney?Hasn't the 21st century witnessed the fate of Savita Halappanavars who are led to their untimely deaths by inhumane laws of nations still unwilling to acknowledge the importance of the life of a mother over her yet unborn child?Doesn't the 21st century have materially prosperous nations governed by absurd, archaic laws which prohibit a woman from driving a car?Doesn't the world still take pleasure in terrorizing activists like Caroline Criado-Perez with threats of rape and murder only because they have the audacity to campaign for female literary icons (Jane Austen) to become the face of Britain's 10-pound note?Do I not live in a country where female foeticide is as normal an occurrence as the rising and setting of the sun?Are we still calling this speculative fiction?Some may wish to labour under the delusion that the women belonging to this much vaunted modern civilization of ours are not experiencing the same nightmare as Offred and are at perfect liberty to do what they desire. But I will not.Because when I look carefully, I notice shackles encircling my feet, my hands, my throat, my womb, my mind. Shackles whose presence I have become so used to since the dawn of time, that I no longer possess the ability to discern between willful submission and conditioned subservience.But thankfully enough, I have Margaret Atwood to jolt me back into consciousness and to will me to believe that I am chained, bound and gagged. That I still need to break free. I thank her for making me shudder with indignation, revulsion and righteous anger. I thank her for causing bile to rise up my throat. And I thank her for forcing me to see that women of the present do live in a dystopia like Offred's United States of America. We just prefer to remain blissfully blind to this fact at times.\nDisclaimer:-\n I mean no disrespect to the other writers mentioned in this review all of whom I have read and deeply admire.", "I. NightI am lying awake in my bed. I keep my eyes closed and beg sleep to come. Fruitlessly! Outside, the rain is whipping the windows without mercy. My husband is sleeping next to me, oblivious to my struggle. I need my thoughts to go away. I need to forget that I just finished the Handmaid's Tale and its effect on me. I knew I should have resumed myself to the self-imposed daily quota of 10%. But no. I had to read the last 30 % in one go and now I can't sleep because of it. It\u2019s like a shot of caffeine to my veins. How can I review such a book? How can I explain how I feel? I don\u2019t even know. I can't say I enjoyed it. I was both dreading and expecting to open the pages. I wanted it to be over, like I want a punishment to be over. It made me choke; I was uncomfortable and in pain the whole 312 pages. However, I was also in awe to the power and poetry of Atwood's writing. The last novel they made me feel this way was Never Let Me Go. I can still smell the heavy the heavy atmosphere. Submission! This is it. Both were about submission to a terrible destiny. I could not understand and accept it then and I cannot do it now. Or can I? What would I do to survive, if submission were the only hope? There is a knot in my throat. What she wrote in this novel, the world she created is absurd isn't it? It cannot happen, not in a million years, right? We are past this, we have evolved enough. We cannot get there. It would be terrible, unthinkable. It is absurd to think that people\u2019s will can be so easily obliterated, that minds can be erased and that fear can rule one\u2019s life into submission. And still... Kim Jung-Un in Korea, Putin in Russia, more recently the election in Turkey. Trump is just as dangerous. Le Pen can become the next president in France. Yes the daughter of the man that said that Holocaust did not exist. The world is a dangerous place and freedom is fragile. We need to open our eyes, be vigilant and never be complacent with what we have so it is not taken from us. I still cannot sleep. The rain becomes even more punishing. My mind races. I think about the past of my country. In the end of the novel, at Historical Notes, there were a few examples of other similar regimes that reacted as Gilead. It said that Romania has anticipated Gilead in the eighties by banning all forms of birth control, and imposing other restrictions. How I wished this was also part of the author\u2019s imagination. Ok, there were no compulsory pregnancy tests and promotion did not depend on fertility but a decree was passed by Ceausescu, our last communist president where all birth control and abortion was banned. The punishment for not complying was severe; women were imprisoned and beaten to confess. During the 20 years when the decree was in place, more than 10,000 women died from illegal, mostly home-made abortions. Another world where men controlled women\u2019s body. Not so long ago. We cannot go back to that, can we? Motherhood. Another hurtful subject. To have your child taken away from you. To be unable to have a child and have your husband conceive with someone else while you watch. A nightmare for any woman (or man). No more love, no more sex for pleasure. No, here I draw the line. I cannot see this happen. And still\u2026 Historical NotesThe above memoir of a distressed reader that could not sleep because of the Handmaid\u2019s Tale, was found in the notes of a mobile phone. It is hard to identify the person that wrote the document as there were probably many people that lost sleep over this novel in Atwood\u2019s republic. She tends to write some uncomfortable stuff, that author. We cannot confirm the authenticity of the document, still the disturbed tone suggests that the person actually read the Handmaid\u2019s Tale and was deeply impressed by it. And scared.P.S. I found in another review an interesting article wrote by Atwood where she discusses the book. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/bo...", "What a perfect time to be scared to death by this novel. It doesn't feel dated or far-fetched at all, thanks to President Trump.Claire Danes is a pretty good match for this narrative.Original reviewImagine the near future where power is overtaken by the religious right under the guise of protection from Islamic terrorism. Imagine the future where the roles of the women reduced to those assigned to them in Old Testament - they are no longer allowed to read, work, own property, or handle money. Imagine that due to the pollution and man-created viruses, the fertility rates are so low that the few fertile women (the Handmaids) are now a communal property and are moved from house to house to be inseminated by men of power under the watchful eye of their wives. Imagine the future where women can only be the Wives, domestics (the Marthas), sexual toys (the Jezebels), female prison guards (the Aunts), wombs (the Handmaids), or, if they are unsuited for any of these roles, Unwomen who are sent off to the Colonies where they harvest cotton if they are lucky or clean out radioactive waste if they aren't.Well, after you've imagined that, you can imagine very easily how much I was terrified by this book. As a modern woman, I am horrified by the notion that at some point in time I can become nothing more than a servant, a toy, a reproductive organ. The world created by Atwood seems too much of a stretch of imagination at a first glance, but if the current climate, how implausible this feminist dystopia really is? To say I am impressed by this novel is to say nothing, really. This book is one of those that stays in your brain and you keep coming back to it over and over again. Having said that, I have to note, that this is definitely not an easy read. Offred (the protagonist Handmaid) is in many ways a frustrating narrator: she is broken, she is passive, she is desperate and her only goal is to make it through another day. The ending is ambiguous. The narration is complex with constant switching from present to past and back. But it all worked perfectly for me. For me, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is a powerful novel that is in my mind next to Saramago's \"Blindness,\" another book that left me sleepless.Reading challenge: #22", "4.8/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum. Don't let the bastards grind you down.\u201d What can I even say about this masterpiece of a book? What can I even say that hasn't already been said? I'm awed to my core, this book is a prediction, a revelation, a hymn. This book is so fucking old, yet so fucking relatable and ahead of its time... it reads like 1984. The events in this dystopian book seem like such a close reality which scares me for the future of humanity. I wanted to read this book for such a long time... but the tv show made me do it, at last. I'm so fascinated by stories like this, dystopian stories that hold truth to them, and I wanted to dive into this book with everything I had. And it happened. This book consumed me, I wanted to know everything, all the little excruciating details of this brand new world, all the thoughts in June's head, everything. The writing was fascinating and yet sometimes I kinda lost track, especially at the dialogue parts which weren't really dialogue. The pace was a little slow, but I'm so used to YA quick pacing so I don't hold that against it. But this book was never boring or dull, it was everything it should be.I saw some major differences with the show, the show took some characters and situations and created multiple things that didn't exist in the book. And I commend them on that. The TV show and and the book are two sides of the same coin, what lacked in the former the latter had and the opposite. One thing that let me down about the book is that we didn't see Serena and her relationship with June flourish at all. Their relationship is such a strong dynamic in the show, it is so fascinating to watch. At least we got to see it develop in the show.I'm so irrevocably happy this story is going to continue, and so soon I've heard. We all know that came to be because of the success of the TV show, but I can't hold that against anyone because the story we are going to follow in the sequel is so much more different than season 2 of the TV show. I can't wait to again devour the next book, and I hope for many nexts. This is my first time reading a book from this author, and I don't think it will be my last.To sum it all up, read this book. It tackles so many important issues about feminism and liberty of speech and it's even more important to read it if you're a woman. Just do it. You won't regret it. And till the next time, K BYE!!!", "Not a very well written book. The writing itself is clumsy. It doesn't feel like you're reading a story; it feels like you're reading a piece of writing. Good writers put their words together for a calculated effect, but Atwood's words aren't just calculated-- they're contrived. In a good piece of writing, you shouldn't see the writer at all. You shouldn't see the structure of their writing. All you should see is the story. If you're seeing the deliberate cadence of a phrase, or the use of repetition instead of its effect, then these style choices weren't done subtly enough. If you can see the writer's style through their words, then they're just not doing it right. I think Atwood very much falls into this trap. Her style lacks the subtlety required to tell a story like this.The other problem is that it's impossible to forget that this was written in the mid-1980s. The appeal of dystopian fiction, I thought, was that it served as a timeless warning against the pitfalls of humanity. Of course, I'm not a big fan of dystopian writing, so I can only draw on 1984 again as a reference, but: the great thing about 1984 is that it doesn't read like it was written in 1948. It doesn't read as an unambiguous warning against communism, which would make it static and irrelevant today, where the red threat has passed. It is as yet a timeless story, a warning against the state, which did not discredit itself in 1989, but which instead took on a new meaning. Today, one doesn't read Orwell as a warning against communism in particular, but against oppression in general. What's great about 1984 is that it is ambiguous enough to remain dynamic and relevant through reinterpretation, but real enough that it resonates across the years to mean something still.The Handmaid's Tale doesn't carry that kind of resonance. It's just not, to me, that powerful a story, and then Atwood drops in details, devices, that ground it more and more solidly into the mid-80s. That the novel is set contemporary to her writing it fixes the action in time. She makes reference to real movies, real magazines, real time frames, real places, real events. But to understand them, you need to have an intimate understanding of what was going on in the world in 1985. You need to understand what North American culture was like. You need to understand how American history was being interpreted. But you also need to understand that Iran was a new player, a new threat on the world stage, and you need to understand how the world reacted to it.But these background concepts are not universal, nor are they timeless. Already people are forgetting about the 1980s brand of feminism, and already people are forgetting about the Iranian revolution. And North American culture is not a homogeneous as it once was: today the religious right could not stage a coup as is described in the novel, because there are too many diverse groups and networks today who would oppose it. Arguably the religious right has seized power, but not like that. Atwood's vision of an extremist revolution is dated, which makes me question the validity of the other warnings she puts forth.That's not to say that I think it's a bad book. Atwood does advance some chilling theories about the future of mankind, and even as I sat there shaking my head and going, \"that could never happen,\" the possibilities are deeply disturbing. The novel served as a warning in its own time, and it is interesting to read it with that in mind. And if you like dystopian fiction, then it is definitely worth a read. I just have a problem in reconciling the novel's message with today's reality, where Atwood's fears actually seem to be the least of our worries.", "\nI don't even know where to start with this book??I was not able to connect with the Characters in the book at all. It was a task to completely finish this book at all.I know I am in the minority, but I don't know what all the hype was with this book. I think that Atwood was long winded in her writing style and did not help with the connections with the Characters. I honestly don't have much more to say about this book.\n", "\nWe were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.\nSet in the not-so-distant future, Offred is designated as a Handmaid. Meaning her fertile womb \"allows\" her to stay in the house of Fred as his legal consort. (Hence the name \"Of Fred\" and the not-so-subtle foreshadowing \"offered\".) Her alternative? Working in the radioactive wastelands (which would undoubtedly lead to her death within 2-3 years). So, she stays on as a \"handmaid\" in the hopes of producing a child by Fred to be raised by him and his wife. Once she fulfills her duties, she'd be passed on to the next man and his wife. As a result, we are forced to read as she is systematically raped by Fred on her fertile nights. Even she accepted it as a part of life - we see a bit of the conditioning and training (brain washing) done on new Handmaids. It's a wonder they all weren't more screwed up.  According to the introduction, Margaret Atwood did not create any of the rules, regulations and punishments forced upon these women. What she did was take all of the real terrors that women have suffered throughout the ages and force them to happen all at once. Thus creating a single eye-opening dystopian novel.This was a difficult novel to read and while I am glad to have read it once, I plan to never (never) look at it again. \nNolite te bastardes carborundorum.

It ends in a very Coen Brothers fashion! That it is tight, then unravels in plot is efficient... then chaotic.

I'm mentioning that to say I really liked how well written it felt and the writing style itself was really appealing to me. I like when writing is a little vague and disconnected, I really enjoy the stream of consciousness type of narration when its done well a lot.

This is a book that definitely hangs with you, haunting your thoughts, long after you finish the book. It is thought-provoking and terrifying.The story centers on the heroine, Offred, who is a \"handmaiden\" in this futuristic world created by Ms. Atwood. As a handmaiden, Offred's sole purpose is to produce a baby for the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy. Once she has served her purpose, she will be reassigned to another high-ranking man for the same purpose. This pattern will repeat over and over, until she is no longer able to bear children. What happens then, nobody really wants to talk about. Worse yet, if she fails to produce a child then she will face a fate reserved for the lowliest of women.This is the world that Offred and others are left with after a brutal civil war stamped out the rights that citizens like Offred had taken for granted. The overthrow of the democratic government was gradual...until it wasn't. The changes that took place were very insidious. One moment, people like Offred were consumed with trivial problems, like where they were going to go out for dinner that night. The next thing they knew, a civil war was raging. Soon, their every movement was monitored closely. Of course, this was for their own \"protection\" and \"safety\". Then, women weren't allowed to hold jobs or manage their own money. (After all, the poor little dears shouldn't have to bear that burden. A man should handle those sorts of things.) Next, anyone that dared to oppose the new regime was eliminated. Before long, citizens like Offred cannot even recognize their new reality. They are stuck under the rule of an incredibly oppressive, misogynistic regime. Worst of all, their complacency paved the way for this gradual overthrow. Little by little, they handed over their rights with little resistance. They refused to see the writing on the wall and wanted to believe the lies that they were spoon-fed. Once they wised up, it was too late. Now, they are a people broken. Women, especially, face a grim fate.This book is remarkable! Although it can be rather slow-moving at times, the message was powerful. This story serves as a cautionary tale and a necessary reminder. Civil rights are hard won and easily lost. It is easy to draw comparisons to many of this books' events and the events of the past and present. Ms. Atwood highlights many important issues and offers a great deal of social commentary. There were so many important topics that she touched upon that I can't even begin to list them. This book is considered to be a classic for a reason. It is a book that needs to be read and taken in by readers. While it isn't necessarily the most entertaining read, it is certainly one of the most enlightening and thought-provoking. I highly recommend that everyone read this book, at least once. ", "The Handmaid\u2019s Tale by Margaret Atwood is a brilliant, endearing, scary as hell book. Told with simplistic prose and stark attention to detail, Atwood describes life in the not too distant future where the United States has been transformed through military coup into a totalitarian theocracy. This dystopian horror story is made all the more real by the bridge Atwood has created between the world we know now and the world that could be \u2013 the story\u2019s protagonist remembers the time before the change. This is, to my knowledge, a unique element in the dystopian genre, whereas in many others the setting is some time in the far future and there seems little hope for change or revolution. More than that, the heroine, Offred (not her real name but the proprietary title she is given) is an approachable, likable character that brings the reader dangerously close to the action. Drawing an obvious correlation between far right conservative Christian movements and Muslim Sharia law authoritarian theocratic ideologies, Atwood has created a disturbing vision. As the reader experiences the story from the perspective of a mother, this story has the added complexity of nurturing relationships turned horribly askew. This is not as terrible as Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night, still in my mind the scariest nightmare I\u2019ve ever even thought about reading, but Atwood\u2019s talent has summoned a specter almost as dark.", "\n\"Nolite te bastardes carborundum.\"\n\n(Don't let the bastards grind you down.)\nMe, after reading this book: \"Meh!\" Because so many of my esteemed Goodreads friends have sung in praise of this novel, I felt that I was destined to join their burgeoning ranks. Instead, I was left scratching my head, wondering if I'd even read the same book!I was that rarity - an Atwood virgin - and I was knee-tremblingly keen to pop my cherry. I would love to say that I was enthralled and that I am now a fan, but I can't. I simply can\u2019t. I'm not a polemicist; it pains me to do this but, aaaghh, I shall be putting my head above the parapet.First, the positives:The concept is venerable, following on in the tradition of dystopian classics, such as Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World.This is a cautionary tale of what *might* happen were we to ignore the erosion of democratic and social freedoms, thereby enabling a right-wing Christian theocracy to take over.The author perfectly captures the resigned bleakness of such a subjugated existence.There were instances of genius, and some moments where I could clearly see certain scenes playing out in the cinema of my mind (the illicit Scrabble games, for example).Now, the negatives:(Apologies to all you Atwood fans; I am actually cringing as I type this).My read got off to an inauspicious start. Almost immediately, I encountered a sentence that was so-o long it straddled different time zones.Here it is:>>A balcony ran around the room, for the spectators, and I thought I could smell, faintly like an afterimage, the pungent scent of sweat, shot through with the sweet taint of chewing gum and perfume from the watching girls, felt-skirted as I knew from pictures, later in mini-skirts, then pants, then in one earring, spiky green-streaked hair.<<So, please convince me, Atwood fans. Tell me honestly that this is not a clumsily-written sentence. And there are ten commas, for crying out loud! TEN, count them!If you arranged the little buggers together in a line, you could almost simulate the legs of a millipede! I so wanted to like this book. I would have loved to have joined the legion of Atwood devotees and be here, right now, singing her praises.But, for me, her prose is perfunctory, the similes are decidedly clunky and the story just plodded along like an emphysemic tortoise. Were it not for the endorsements of my Goodreads friends rattling about in my mind, I would have abandoned it.Despite its Chaucerian title, the book is set in an unspecified future where America has been hijacked by Christian Fundamentalists who treat enslaved fertile women as wombs on legs (an Old Testament-style version of the Taliban, I guess).It's told in the first-person narrative, from the POV of Offred, one such fem-slave, whose sole purpose in life is to endure loveless copulation in the hope of successful fertilisation.She remembers life before servitude and secretly wishes to be valued. \"It\u2019s only the insides of our bodies that are important.\"It gives me no pleasure to write this; I fully realise that I am swimming against the tide of popular opinion here. I feel like the mutinous child in Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes.The book is prescient and has topical relevance, but so does 1984 and Brave New World. Each is far better (in my humble opinion).I am so sorry, Atwood addicts.I must be missing something.It's not you, dahhlings, it's me.", "Terrifying! But SO good! Update in Year One ... No .... It's Already Year Two ... Terrible Two ... Of Dystopia:  As long as you are allowed and capable to read, please do read this novel! In an era when politicians in the Western world are not ashamed to refer to pregnant women as \"hosts\", deprived of their rights as individuals, we must start speaking up against the steady realisation of dystopian fiction. Let these authors, such as Orwell, Atwood, or Ishiguro, stay great writers of fiction! Don't make them involuntary prophets!If we don't oppose the hypocrisy and illogical idiocy of lawmaking against women's choice regarding unwanted pregnancy, claiming that it is based on moral and religious grounds, we will have a society ruled by 17th century Puritans with an evil modern twist.\"Thou shalt not kill!\" I agree. Let's start implementing that commandment where people are actually dying.I am Pro Life: Let's work to put an end to the distribution and availability of weapons, the death penalty, and wars. Let's speak up for better health care to protect the lives of millions of human beings. Let's support refugees from other parts of the world that are threatened by war or famines or disease. Let's focus on the big issues that threaten life on earth! Let's care for our environment. Pro Life!Update a couple of months into Year One Of Dystopia: I just listened to an interview with a conservative Catholic politician in the UK who believes so much in the teachings of the Catholic Church that he thinks it is morally indefensible for a woman raped by a family member to have an abortion. Where is the novelist who can write a science fiction story about him waking up in hell after death and realising that Catholicism was not the absolute truth after all, but Hinduism. He receives the message that his next incarnation on Earth will be a young Catholic girl raped by a priest. Oh karma!In Year Two of Dystopia we still quote the bible both to justify forbidding abortion AND to cause massive trauma to babies born on the wrong side of a border. Pro Life, anyone? Pro children?Pro human beings? We are moving into Gilead, and it is no fun. I had intended to post news about misogyny in the Western world here regularly, to point out the incredible importance of this book regularly, but the sheer mass of reports makes it impossible. Today's harvest, among other things: 100,000 Christians subscribe to try to prevent US libraries from supporting a Drag Queen Story Time, bizarrely claiming it would \"teach boys to become drag queens\"! How long will we have to listen to that bullshit? Sorry for the expletive, but I am angry, really angry. If one could choose one's sexuality, I think many, many women who are victims of domestic rape would choose to be gay to escape toxic masculinity once and for all, but unfortunately, that is not how it works. Otherwise I would like to re-educate all patriarchs to a different sexual orientation, as theirs is by far the one that harms society most.I can't wait to see what happens to Offred next, but I sense a gloomy sequel... The Testaments will tell.", "An interesting book to read right now for a couple of reasons. One, I just finished 1984 and it was very much a world like the one in 1984. Two, the storyline closely reflects the fears of the current political climate in America.It is hard to say that a story like this is \"great\" as that has a positive connotation. I was very enthralling, but terrifying at the same time. As a man, I don't think this story has as deep of an impact on me as it would if I was a woman. If you like dystopian, you must check this book out. If you are fired up by the recent election, you may want to hold off a bit . . . it will only make it worse.", "\nDon't let the bastards grind you down.\nThere's a lot of talk about women's rights these days. There were times where I thought: enough already. You girls got it good. I looked around me and saw women with strong voices and a million choices. If they wished to go for a career, they could go for it. If they didn't, no biggie. Their liberty seemed greater than men's in a lot of respects. The power they wield over men is magnificent and often described as the greatest humanity is capable of: a woman's love. They can choose to give it or withhold it. Men's political and physical powers look puny and artificial in contrast, as their strings are constantly pulled by forces they can't resist. Somewhere deep inside me I had a hard time believing things could really be so bad for women, with their majority in numbers and all this strenght at their disposal. But then you turn on the news or you open a history book. You look outside your own country. You look at a presidential candidate talking about women as animals, as goods to be acquired, as territories to be conquered. You see people making excuses for it, making light of it, you see in their eyes they assume that it's normal. You see laws that tell women what to do with their own bodies, in the name of religion or the greater good. You hear of households where tiny kings use their physical power to terrorise their tiny kingdoms. And then you see all the machinations that have gone into trying to rob women of their mystical, almost holy, powers in greater kingdoms, machinations that often seem on the verge of systematising in the blink of an eye.So, having accepted that the Woman's struggle is real, I was reading The Handmaid's Tale that paints a picture of how things would look like if circumstance and evil succeeded in stripping women of all the agency they have. When they have succesfully been ground down by the bastards. Bastards aren't Men, per se. Or all men. Or only men. This isn't so much a story about women versus men. It's a story of the artificial power against the real one, a story where the former won.It's a bleak picture. Atwood uses the very claustrophobic perspective of Offred to great effect. Offred is the eponymous handmaid who find herself in a dystopia where her only societal value is also a curse: her fertility. Her world consists of her room, a stroll down the stairs, a garden, a walk to the butcher and her one and only societal mission: to get pregnant. She has to wear a cape that allows her to only look directly in front of her. She's isolated and stripped of her identity. Even her memories are slowly disappearing and losing relevance in a surrounding that offers nothing to link them to. Through this narrative Margaret Atwood succeeds in donning that same vision-confining cape on her readers' heads, immersing them in that same claustrophobic atmosphere.This books does very well what it set out to do and that also explains why I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. I wanted more background. I wanted more explanations. I wanted more adventure. I wanted more action by the protagonist. I wanted her spirit, still apparent in the secretly hoarding of butter and the plotting of small thefts, to break free and wreak havoc among the bastards. Make them lose without losing herself. I wanted more direction. I wanted the flashes of hope to last. In short: the author succeeded in making me want what the protagonist wanted. She showed me what it is we should all strive to avoid actively. An important book, and a good one to boot. ", "EDIT 02/06/2016: Lowering the rating to two. I finished it more than a week ago and now I realized I haven't thought of it once. It really left me nothing.\"Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some.\"I used to think of my reading taste as predictable. Well, at least a very specific part of my reading taste: namely, there are very few things in the world that I love more than I love dyostopias in the style of \n1984\n and, above any other, \nBrave New World\n (seriously, you need to read that book). This is why I was convinced I was bound to like The Handmaid's Tale; and yet, right before I started it, I was caught by a hunch that my certainties were not certain at all.I don't know if it's self-conditioning or whatever, but my gut feelings lately are unerring.\u2022Have you ever heard of Coleridge and the suspension of disbelief? \"...a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith.\" In the majority of cases, we don't even realize we're granting the author and the story our suspension of disbelief. We just believe, because we are prepared to, because we know that if we don't, then reading is no use, especially if what we are dealing with is a fantasy or sci-fi book. Lo and behold, this book made me struggle to grant it my suspension of disbelief. I still have not decided if it was due to the writing, or the story in itself, or something else yet, but that is what happened, and it totally ruined it for me.\u2022In my defense, the lack of explanations, or better, the fact that they are given only when we are well into the story, practically towards the end, did not help. Most of the time, I just felt like I was groping around in the dark, and honestly, it was annoying, annoying, annoying. Besides, we are supposed to believe that this full-scale change that swept across the society happened in approximately eight or ten years at most, (we don't know the chronological details) and I found I just couldn't believe it. It's too radical a transformation, and according to the book the mentality it brought about is already well-implanted into the citizens -not everyone, naturally, but generally it is. It's par for the course for a dictatorship to establish itself in a matter of years, but it requires nonetheless the long-standing presence of a certain set of ideas that justifies and forms the basis of the building of an ideology. What we see in The Handmaid's Tale is the cause, the ultimate effect, and none of the passages in between. I need the in-between. I need the whole picture.\u2022This lack of \"background\", if you can call it so, made it impossible for me to lose myself int he story. The narrative voice, the protagonist's, is ineffective, bland, not nearly as trenchant as such a strong story requires. She should be able to heighten our disgust for the situation out of sympathy towards her and her circumstances, but to me, and you are allowed to call me heartless, nothing of this happened. I was horrified by what she and the whole female population have to suffer, but it was only an objective aversion due to an objective state of affairs, and not even partly to the empathy I should have felt for the character. I read stories to connect with the people in them; otherwise, I would read nonfiction.\u2022The plot is uneventful, almost literally. Usually this is not something I consider a priori as a flaw, but in this case it felt like one. \u27bd On balance, I did not enjoy it. I acknowledge its value, but it was quite an effort for me to get through it. Now that I think of it, probably it's kind of a 2.5 instead of a full 3.", "\nI would love to write a lengthy review for this book. But I can't. Because I'm so emotionally drained after reading it that it's a miracle I'm not still hiding underneath a pile of blankets, sobbing. This is by no means an easy read, but I think it's a book that everyone needs to read.

When I joined GR in 2008, I gave it 4* from memory, but reread a year later with GR book group and gave it the full 5*.In 2019, I skimmed it again before reading the follow-up, The Testaments (see my review HERE). Gilead no longer feels far-fetched. Review from 2009A wonderful hybrid: a book that is eminently readable, but packed with fascinating and thought-provoking ideas and symbolism.It's set in the near future in a dystopian totalitarian theocratic state where many are infertile, so there has been a backlash against permissiveness and women are subjugated to the point where they are not allowed to read or write (even shop signs are just icons). Of course, the regime never considers that men could be at fault in any way, including their fertility or lack of.Offred tells the story of how she became a handmaid, assigned to one of the elite, purely for breeding purposes.Truer than you want to thinkAll the many and varied restrictions, practices, divisions and penalties imposed by the regime have really been applied somewhere in the world, albeit not all at the same time and place. One of the things that stops the book being gloomy is the resilience of the human spirit: there is a resistance movement among the lower classes and even amongst the elite, illicit things go on. The fear of being caught creates a good sense of tension.Faith and ritualFaith and ritual are important, both to the regime as a means of control and, in a different way, to individuals as a way of making life bearable. Image: A game of Scrabble (Source.)SymbolismThe symbolism is rich, especially tulips and the colour red. The handmaids' sole purpose is procreation, their cycles are closely monitored, everything they wear is red and other important red items (such as a path) are pointed out. Whilst the shape of tulip flowers clearly echoes genitalia, they are also likened to a wound and teeth, and they and other flowers are described in different ways to indicate fertility or sterility. Serena Joy's knitting is a compulsive form of reproduction with sinister echoes of Dickens' Madame Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities.Themes and questionsThe big questions are around ownership of oneself and one's body, and about motherhood (biological versus adoption). The state is patriarchal, but an army of matriarchal \"aunts\" enforce rituals and build a hive mentality to support each other and hence the regime. Are the handmaids prostitutes (is Nick too)? No, because they have no choice. They are slaves. They \"sell\" their bodies for the survival of themselves as individuals and of the human race. The aim is (supposedly) solely procreation, not anyone's pleasure (the wife is always present). Do the ends justify the means, and should the handmaids accept some responsibility for going along with it? The more you read (including the follow-up, The Testaments), the more you realise that's not possible. And if \"context is all\", what is truth? You could read this several times and never come up with exactly the same answer.See also* The Testaments, obviously, which Atwood wrote 30 years later, to show how Gilead fell and how Aunt Lydia came to be Aunt Lydia: see my review HERE.* The 1990 film of Handmaid, which many dislike (and I don't really remember). However, the screenplay was by Harold Pinter, and it starred Natasha Richardson, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and Aidan Quinn. See imdb.* The 2017-2019 TV series. Series 1 was a pretty good adaptation of Handmaid, but series 2 and 3 took the story further, with new material. See Wikipedia.* When She Woke has many parallels, but I didn't like it: see my review HERE.* Fahrenheit 451: see my review HERE.", "The Handmaid's Tale portrays a terrifying but very real and possible dystopia. At first, it's difficult to tell what exactly is going on in the handmaid's world, although her spare narration is filled with a deep sense of fear and danger. It's challenging but exciting to try to make sense of all the frightening details that she describes, and that's one of the things that made this such a compelling read for me--I was desperate to figure out what was happening as well as how and why things had gone so wrong. The story progresses beautifully, as the details of the present unravel at the same time and with the same urgency as the events of the past, tracing a frighteningly believable path from our world to hers. One thing that I really liked about the development of the story: as the circumstances of the handmaid's life and surroundings become clearer and more oppressive, she actually seems to gain some small measure of hope. There's a constantly escalating contrast between the powers threatening her and the growing strength of her voice. For me, I guess the most beautiful and thrilling theme of this novel was its focus on the fragility and importance of our small little moments of happiness. So many times the main character reflects on images from her past and thinks, \"And we didn't even know we were happy then.\" Atwood has done a masterful job of portraying how quickly and uncontrollably the things by which we define our daily selves can be destroyed and rewritten, and how our fear and desire to keep on living makes us silent in the face of power.I love books that stay with me during the time when I'm away from them, and this is definitely one those books. Over the past few days, I've frequently found myself sitting on the metro, looking out the window and thinking about different passages and themes from the novel, marveling at how the story seems both far away and very familiar.I'd be interested to chat with anyone else about their take on the book. I'd like to know if other people think it's just terrifying all the way through or whether it ever reaches a point at which it's somewhat hopeful. Looking back on it, I can't really tell. At times, the terror in this novel seems so great that even the smallest glimpses of hope seem bigger than life. 4.5/5", "\u201cA rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze.\u201dThis was my first adult dystopian novel and also the most realistic one I've read. Scary realistic even. I doubt that the future is ever going to look like this, but Margaret Atwood painted a multi-layered and thought-provoking picture that is going to stay with me for quite a while.I've never read a Margaret Atwood book before, but I have been eyeing her works for a while now. I just didn't know where to start. The reasons I finally picked this up are firstly Emma Watson, who picked this book for the Our Shared Shelf book club and secondly, the TV show that just aired a few weeks ago that I am anxious to see.I've never read a book like this before. The writing is impeccable, detailed and ultimately beautiful. The way Atwood shaped this world with her words went under my skin, and it was a pleasure to read this. The simplicity of the Handmaid's tale is captivating, especially because it draws you in so easily.Other than that it is a deeply feminist book, eye-opening and shocking. I recommed this to everyone and I can't wait to read more of Atwood's books.Find more of my books on Instagram", "If 1984 is the father, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is the mother. They are both in the same category and yet they are different. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is more... feminine. It revolves around Offred\u2019s drama, unlike 1984, which revolves more around the ideology (more like a battle between Winston\u2019s ideas and O\u2019Brien\u2019s ideas).*I\u2019ve read it with the shittiest combination of rage, sadness, fear and paranoia, which stuck with me throughout the entire book. I don\u2019t easily get this emotional. But let me tell you \u2013 I honestly felt like everything happening there is inevitable. Before Chapter 28 I tried to justify the way this society worked. You have some sort of nuclear war that brought the human race on the verge of extinction (or so you are told). And I asked myself \u2013 if I had the power, what would I do in this situation? It made me think of Inferno by Dan Brown \u2013 would you be willing to destroy half of humanity in order to save the human species from extinction? But then I reached Chapter 28 (which, in my opinion, is the best chapter). I saw how easily they\u2019ve got to this, how easily they accepted it. People in power will always abuse it and the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.*At first it was a bit hard to wrap my head around the style of this book (it felt a bit boring), but after a few chapters I got drawn into in.*The ending surprised me.*The second ending surprised me even more. I was so caught up in the story that I asked myself \u201cdude, did this really happen?!\u201d And then I realised I\u2019m silly haha.

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498169036l/32620332.jpg", "title": "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo", "authors": "Taylor Jenkins Reid", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo", "reviews": ["\n\n\u201cI spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the best books I\u2019ve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words I\u2019m about to type, and you\u2019re about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, and Elyse were all right, and I\u2019m so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype. And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess you\u2019ve ever seen. \n\n\u201cAnd it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOn top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldn\u2019t spend it pretending to be something we aren\u2019t. And we shouldn\u2019t spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.\u201d\n\nWe follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things I\u2019ve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too. This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her. \n\n\u201cHeartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.\u201d\n\nThe other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelyn\u2019s life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.\n\n\u201cMake them pay you what they would pay a white man.\u201d\n\nIf you guys have been following my reviews, you\u2019ll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harry\u2019s friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever read in my entire reading life. \n\n\u201cWhen you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it\u2019s clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.\u201d\n\nAnd the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know I\u2019ve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them can\u2019t compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time I\u2019ve used the word \u201cperfect\u201d to describe something that wasn\u2019t the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong. \n\n\u201cPlease never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. You\u2019re the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.\u201d\n\nHow many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in queer history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks I\u2019ve experienced holding a girl\u2019s hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. I\u2019m not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me. I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise. \n\n\u201cI was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.\u201d\n\nThis book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now. This was the first thing I\u2019ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature I\u2019ve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book. \n\n\u201cI told her every single day that her life had been the world\u2019s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.\u201d\n\nIf you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, I\u2019m actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if you\u2019re an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesn\u2019t take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and I\u2019ll cherish it forever. \n\n\u201cPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is \u201cYou\u2019re safe with me\u201d\u2014that\u2019s intimacy.\u201d\n\nTrigger/Content Warnings: death of a loved one, death of a child, talk of suicide, unhealthy dieting, underage sex with an adult, abortion, talk of miscarriage, a lot of physical abuse, cheating, dunk driving, and homophobic slurs.

My Vlog \u2764", "I want to be as motivated and focused in university as Evelyn Hugo was in continuing to flourish after all of her 7 divorces and getting richer than all of her 7 husbands combined.... then spend the rest of her days frolicking in sun hazed fields of butterflies and dandelion clocks with her wife.This book was so wild I feel like it fundamentally changed me as a human being. I've witnessed cosmic justice at its coldest and its darkest. I'm genuinely so tempted to go buy myself an expensive bottle of wine and drink it alone in a hammock while listening to 80s music and cry just for the drama of it all. That probably won't solve all my life\u2019s problems but it would certainly distract me from them.\n\nso what is this book about?\n\nContrary to appearances, this is not the mere tale of a sultry glamourous woman with seven husbands and a tragic fame. This is the multifaceted story of a woman who's lived her whole life being two people, two images overlapping. A woman who was driven by the sheer compulsion for recognition combined with a need to charm people and shine and in that process, she\u2019s built her own hell and heaven, solely crafted by the pure abstraction of her essence. A woman who\u2019s got everyone to kneel before her throne unaware that it was born of lies so easily because everyone\u2019s only ever liked the idea of her and not the reality of her.This is her story after the mask has worn off and showed what was lurking behind it, her truth without being edited, moderated and filtered down by the time it makes it to the screen, and then given to the public to make them feel very comfortable.This is her story 7 decades later after she\u2019s decided it was never her job to make them feel comfortable in the first place. Evelyn Hugo no longer desires to be off on her own diva planet. She wanted to be on Earth. She wanted to be seen. She was past needing celebrity. She needed to be heard.\u00a0She refuses to be trivialized for being a woman, a sex symbol, and a celebrity. She wasn\u2019t just the Cuban girl who changed her name, dyed her hair, wore the emerald green silk dresses and the accompanying chains, smiled pretty, and shut up about everything else. She was ready to talk about the void, the unhappiness underneath the smile, her age, her divorces, and all the other unglamorous things that Hollywood likes to pretend never happens to its starlets.She is ready to declare that youth and beauty and the movies and the seven husbands were not her accomplishments. The family she\u2019s had and lost and the woman she's so fiercely loved for almost six decades were.\nThey are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.\nWhat I loved most about this book was how passionate it was in bringing to light so many important topics.Starting with being a woman in an industry that\u00a0beholds women to its whims, its likes and dislikes, promotes them as sexual objects and\u00a0loves to build a woman up before tearing her down. An industry that estimates male celebrities based on intelligence or depth, while it values female celebrities based on how sexually available they are presented for male consumption. Especially when you're a woman of color. A woman of color could never escape from race or gender when she is making art. She can\u2019t take off her color and sex and leave them at the door, and for that she's unfairly \u00a0redeemed unimportant and undeserving of a storyline and character development.This book was also single-handedly smashing the patriarchy. So buckle up.Evelyn Hugo\u2019s story was a Call Out against the men who had cut her down way below size and built themselves up at her expense, who only used her as an attention machine to brag about their accomplishments and relieve themselves of mental durress, who only considered her a sponge that they can fill with their worries and ego and squeeze out when they please. The men who admired her confidence only when it made her fun, flirty, and comfortable in her sexuality. But the second she claimed space for herself, demonstrated high standards, a strong will, and the kind of assertiveness required to challenge them, then all of a sudden, she was a bunch of derogatory terms.And it's honestly so real how women are continuously expected to tone down and dilute their personalities in order for them to look more appealing to men. Women are always too opinionated, too educated, too confident, too strong willed, too passionate. Women are expected to chip away at their selves to become more soft and pliable and easy to stomach and all of it is just patriarchy's last attempt to uphold power and entitlement.This book also broached the topic of divorce and how it often means eternal shame for women. How only women are blamed when their marriages fail and ostracized when they seek to\u00a0open their lives up to a quiet and peaceful independence. The media tore into Evelyn after each divorce, dragged her, burned her (metaphorically) alive, and buried her body underneath thousands of unsubstantiated celebrity gossip while her husbands remained unscathed.\nPeople don\u2019t find it very sympathetic or endearing, a woman who puts herself first.\nPrior to reading this book, I didn't know it centered a queer woman of color and that it repped lgbtq+ themes which is why I didn't pick it up sooner. I really can't emphasize enough the importance of highlighting reprensentation in books. Readers from marginalized communities, including myself, long to see themselves in fiction, to learn that they can be the heroes of their stories and to finally get to star. Queer themes and issues had a prominent presence in this historical novel and it's really important that this be mentioned in reviews and blurbs!!\nYou imagine a world where the two of you can go out to dinner together on a Saturday night and no one thinks twice about it. It makes you want to cry, the simplicity of it, the smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.\nThis book is about Evelyn Hugo\u00a0being honest about her negative habits and mistakes and taking ownership of her faults and flaws. This is her demanding to be humanized after being put on a pedestal her entire life. And most importantly, this book is a reminder that no matter how glamorous other people\u2019s lives might look, they've had days, many days, and many days in a row where they've felt unloved and rejected and ugly and like nothing they do has a point, they\u2019re not all that different and untouchable after all.Overall, I really loved this book. The plot twists were incredible. I really can't recommend it highly enough!!30/11/17: so Evelyn\u2019s had seven husbands and I can\u2019t even get (1) one person to wave back at me when I say hi.............", "I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful. And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.\n\n\u201cMake them pay you as much as they would a white man.\u201d\n\nThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her. But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn. Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I\u2019m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is such a good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I love that. Evelyn\u2019s story is one of being a woman in a man\u2019s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman\u2019s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices were right. Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but\u2026 well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn\u2019s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always. \n\n\u201cPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.\n\u201cYou didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasons why we don't want to give. It shouldn't just be that we don't want to give up. And I don't... have any. \u201cYou have never felt like my other half.\u201d\nI know I\u2019ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don\u2019t know exactly how to put into words what this book meant to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid felt this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me an emotional mess, but also a happy mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube", "\nIs Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?\nI can't say for sure what drew me to this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway. And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was so delicious and compelling that it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot of The Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. Unlike The Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied. Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals. I enjoyed every moment.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "This is genuinely one of the most remarkable novels I have ever read. It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted by The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I will never forget how much I adore this book. CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racism (view spoiler)[abortion & suicide (hide spoiler)] Adult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn\u2019t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging \u2013 it was a huge struggle to put the book down. Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn\u2019t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it\u2019s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it\u2019s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique\u2019s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.)", "(4.5) I\u2019ve been struggling with a lot of books lately because I just don\u2019t care about them. I don\u2019t care about the story. I don\u2019t care about the characters. I just don\u2019t care! I thought it was all me, that I must have a cold heart but then this book happened.I thought this was a literary fiction but it read more like a chick lit. A deep chick lit if that can even be a thing. This book made me realize that it is absolutely not me but them! I cared deeply for the flawed characters in this book. When reading a book heartless Emily does not cry. Ever. Well, I did while reading this one.Just pick it up and read it already!", "3.75 stars\n\n\n\nHeartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.\nEvelyn Hugo was the star of the century. She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo was married seven times. Each divorce only increased her fame. Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.\nI\u2019m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.\nAnd now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her most wildly famous gowns and offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the most \nscandalous and salacious \nthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind. \nSometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.\n\nOverall, this one was good but I was never wowed. \nEveryone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know. I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas. We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about how \nwonderful and stunning\n a person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up. I really loved how Evelyn's sexuality was portrayed in this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love for (view spoiler)[ Celia (hide spoiler)] throughout the years truly made this wildly unbelievable story cinch for me. Honestly, (view spoiler)[ her relationship with Celia  (hide spoiler)]Their love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life. Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!\nNever let anyone make you feel ordinary.\nYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!", "\u201dEvelyn always leaves you hoping you\u2019ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.\u201dThis book was so, so, so GOOD!! I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I\u2019d love it with all my heart! <3 There\u2019s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told! We didn\u2019t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean \u201cHollywood Digest\u201d, \u201cSub Rosa\u201d or the \u201cNew York Tribune\u201d, they all wrote about Evelyn\u2019s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich. I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn\u2019s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It\u2019s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out. Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn\u2019t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don\u2019t know what to do with them. Maybe I\u2019ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there\u2019s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that. And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid\u2019s plan all along. ;-)The characters:\nWelcome to my characters section, aka \u201cThe spoilery spoiler zone\u201d! If you didn\u2019t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don\u2019t continue to read my review. I\u2019m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I\u2019ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you! ;-P\nEvelyn Hugo:\u201dAnd I didn\u2019t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don\u2019t feel regret for the things I\u2019ve done \u2013 at least, not the things you might expect \u2013 despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.\u201d Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can\u2019t even! <333 It\u2019s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh, WHAT. A. WOMAN!  I think I might be in love with her! <333\u201dDid I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.\u201d\u201dI told her every single day that her life had been the world\u2019s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.\u201d \u201dI regret every second I didn\u2019t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, \u2018I\u2019m in love with Celia St. James!\u2019 and let them crucify me for it.\u201dCelia St. James:\u201dI really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can\u2019t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn\u2019t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.\u201dNow here\u2019s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn\u2019s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but \u2013 and here comes the huge \nBUT\n \u2013 I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don\u2019t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn\u2019t like that Celia wasn\u2019t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You\u2019d think a person who represents the \u201cL\u201d in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn\u2019s life and that made me really sad. =(\u201dThat was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.\u201d\u201dSo I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky. Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.\u201dHarry Cameron:\u201dI want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I\u2019d like to bring someone home to my family. I don\u2019t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can\u2019t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I\u2019d love to raise one with you.\u201dAside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron was truly the best thing about this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he\u2019s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry\u2019s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:\u201dWhy, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?\u201d To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique\u2019s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn\u2019t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father\u2019s death was necessary to find her happiness and I\u2019m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*\u201dI\u2019m Evelyn.\u201d She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.\u201d\u201dI insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you\u2019ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.\u201dThe relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:\u201dI wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.\u201d Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn\u2019t let them and wouldn\u2019t have understood, because they didn\u2019t want the same thing, because they weren\u2019t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because\u2026 just \nBECAUSE!\n There was always another reason why they couldn\u2019t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn\u2019s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn\u2019s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic\u2026 more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T\u201dEvelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.\u201dEvelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, \u201cCelia St. James.\u201dThe room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. \u201cI feel like I spent my entire life loving her.\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Celia said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong, sweetheart. It\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re wrong.\u201d\u201dIf you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why \u2026 why couldn\u2019t we overcome it?\u201d\u201cWe did,\u201d I said, turning towards her. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dShe shook her head. \u201cBut the years,\u201d she said.\u201dThere\u2019s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.\u201dEvelyn & Harry:\u201dYou do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, you can fall down now. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201dSo I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutely \nE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!\n Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can\u2019t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other\u2019s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It\u2019s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that\u2026 ARGH! I just LOVED them!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I\u2019m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs* \u201dI promise I\u2019ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.\u201d\u201cOK,\u201d Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. \u201cWe will figure this out.\u201d \u201dI want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.\u201d I grabbed his hand tighter. \u201cBut if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it\u2019s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.\u201d The bi rep:\u201dIt really makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?\u201dAnd now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I\u2019ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn\u2019t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I\u2019m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn\u2019t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333\u201dBeing bisexual didn\u2019t make me disloyal,\u201d Evelyn says. \u201cOne has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.\u201d \u201dI hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I\u2019d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.\u201d\u201dWow,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible. I married a dyke.\u201d\u201cStop saying that,\u201d I said.\u201cEvelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don\u2019t be a self-hating lesbian. That\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2019s not becoming.\u201d My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I\u2019m convinced everyone who reads \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d will learn something good from it! I\u2019m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don\u2019t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charming Ashley for this wonderful buddy read! We both didn\u2019t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I\u2019m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we\u2019ll find another book to buddy read again! =)", "\nWhat an extraordinary and surprising read. Absolutely adored this one.\n", "5/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f\u201cPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.\u201d This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. \"I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her.\" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn\u2019s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn\u2019s life unfolds through the decades\u2014revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love\u2014Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn\u2019s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique\u2019s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the \nOutlander\n and \nRoss Poldark\n kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like \"Oh, I will watch that movie next.\", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!", "\nSuch a fabulous well crafted story! I'll be talking about it more in my stories I ate this month video going up tomorrow =) (Oct 9)\n", "FULL REVIEW POSTED*5+ Stars* Brilliant! If I could recommend only one book for 2018, THIS would be it!THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO not only surpassed my already-lofty expectations, but knocked my proverbial socks off as it shot straight into the open arms of my favorites-shelf. The spirit of this story mirrors its leading lady, Evelyn Hugo, in that it feels gigantic and larger~than~life. I wanted to devour this whole, yet savor it in tiny pieces so I could linger with these characters whom I grew to admire for their extraordinary strengths and unabashed weaknesses. The exceptionally beautiful, world-renowned Evelyn Hugo spent most of her life doing whatever it took to not only become Hollywood\u2019s most iconic female movie star, but to remain planted in the fickle grip of fame and fortune. Evelyn\u2019s now up there in years and wants to tell her story. Not the story the public knows\u2014her real story\u2014the one that\u2019s flooded with glamor, betrayal, secrets and deceit, and one hell of a complicated love story so intensely authentic it dares to bare it all, even the ugly. And I was so desperately in love with this love story.This tale is delivered through the heart and eyes of a woman who's desperate to be seen beyond her celebrity, and it takes an unflinching look at what it means to \u201cmake it\u201d: The pride that follows success, and the trail of guilt that lingers for all those who were trampled and used on the way to the top. But beneath the guise of fame, Evelyn's story transcends, and its pieces resonate with all of us, as we can all see a bit of ourselves in her struggles and triumphs; love and loss; pains and pleasures. Evelyn Hugo isn\u2019t just a brilliant fictional character, she is a bold representation of life\u2019s extravagant journey being stripped down to its most basic components\u2014i.e., the only things that actually matter in life. The mystery entwined in this one is taut and sophisticated as it carries the plot full circle, opening our eyes to all that is harsh and all that is sacred. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed\u2014and my heart was overflowing with love for all of it. Taylor Jenkins Reid masters the art of storytelling and epitomizes the value of honesty, the significance of life, and the beauty in love of all forms. Her writing is polished and engrossing, sophisticated and sharp, witty, fluid, and I can go on\u2026but most importantly, it has a voice that carries its messages straight into the heart of the reader. This story stole my breath from its first pages right up until its final line, which was perhaps my favorite line of the novel. To say I couldn't put this down would be an unjust understatement, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever truly be able to put this one down. \n\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa \u00a0Genre/Category: Contemporary Fiction/Women\u2019s Fiction/Romance\u25aa \u00a0Characters: Wholly lovable, and really came to life.

The characters are utterly captivating and complex. The audiobook was wonderfully narrated. I am a FAN!\n", "Update: $2.99 Kindle special today. This book is TERRIFIC. Men- women - most readers will love it. Great price if you\u2019ve missed it! Evelyn Hugo, born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban immigrants, grew up poor in Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. By 1955 she was in Hollywood. Evelyn is beautiful....as tall and slim as a ballerina, with straight thick eyebrows, oversize almond shape eyes, blonde hair, ( dyed only after she arrives in Hollywood to help her get acting roles), rich, powerful, charming, and exudes a casualness and confidence that makes her all the more radiating. This enchanting lovely woman was humble - down to earth in areas that mattered. Yes, she had seven husbands, too! I was quickly bewitched, fully captivated by Evelyn Hugo. It was her calm wisdom - humble but direct speaking that moved me. She made a distinction about words and how they can be misleading, that made me want to SCREAM OUT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT!!!!!! There was a scene early in the book where it was very clear how one word could induce shame. Words really can hurt and paint evil pictures.... preaching...assumptions before asking.... sarcasm.....etc. I sat and thought about all the times people have used words - not chosen them carefully - and as a result I'd feel hurt or belittled. I'm no better. I also thought about times I did the same to others. Words do hurt and damage the spirit- and the trust of relationships. Ms. Hugo, 79 year old Hollywood legend, handled those 'wrong words' with grace, correcting - teaching- inspiring her new-friend at the time while having compassion for 'herself'. Her purpose was not to hurt her friend who spoke the wrong words - but also not to allow for the misleading word to be, \"misleading\". I started reading 'slower' ( wanting to take in every word out of Evelyn Hugo's mouth), when I realized this Hollywood notable Starlett was sincerely deserving- and worthy of the fans she has -- a celebrity to love!!! I soon discovered this classy gorgeous woman had acute self-awareness, high levels of emotional intelligence, clearly socially aware, and relentlessly lived a full life of many experiences filled with joy and challenges. I felt like I was given a gift - absorbing wisdom from this 79 year old woman. Her life experiences were fascinating, glamorous, scandalous and she herself was .....*extraordinary*. I was learning from this fictional character. Monique Grant, Evelyn's new friend, 35 years old, is an unknown reporter at 'Vivant', in Los Angeles. Evelyn wants Monique to write a book about her life story. Everyone in the journalism community- including Monique's boss, Frankie, were shocked that Evelyn asked for Monique. ONLY Monique -- or no deal at all!!! There are some complications for Monique to figure out with work--plus her husband, David just left her....( not even married a full year), but her life is about to change. Why did Evelyn pick Monique to write her book? We wonder right away!!!We also want to know about Evelyn's life - her husband's - and which one she loved the most. We have many questions as we take this journey-- and it's delicious- with many insightful life lessons and messages.Intimacy - closeness - trust - and real friendship grows as Monique listens to Evelyn's life story. Monique is past the point of remaining objective. She knows how specular of a human being Evelyn is. Against all of her journalistic integrity Monique feels a full range of emotions for her. Monique begins to feel a deep connection and love with Evelyn. There are many juicy stories that get revealed about Evelyn's past marriages, relationships, and movies she stars in, \"Father and Daughter\", \"Little Women\", and the title role in \"Anna Karenina\", however when Evelyn begins to share about her present day life......a secret door becomes unhinged. Both women will have to face the truth together. My final words.... THIS NOVEL IS EARTH SHATTERING FABULOUS- FANTASTIC -WONDERFUL -soooooo GOOD I can barely stand it!!!!!! It's 'not' what you think it is!!!!!!I laughed, I cried, and thankful that this book kept me cozy company while sick in bed!!!!!Many Thanks Atria Books, Netgalley, Jamie, ( my friend who demanded I 'not' wait for the audiobook book as planned - that I RUN over to Netgalley and begged for this book and then drop everything and start reading if given the opportunity -- bless you Jamie Girl.... and last to Taylor Jenkins Reid... ( you really out-did yourself with this novel... amazing!!!! Love You for it!!)", "I read Daisy Jones and the Six a couple of months ago. Usually I don\u2019t read two books by the same author this close \u2013 mainly so I can spread out my enjoyment of their works. But, to be honest, when I put them both on hold, I didn\u2019t realize they were the same author! Then, the holds come in when they come in . . . so, I have to read them whether I am ready or not. In this case I am definitely overwhelmed with Taylor Jenkins Reid goodness! Spoiled, even!Both of these books have an interview/tell all format. I have to say that I find it to be one of the best formats I have come across recently. Reid turns fiction into non-fiction; making it feel like I am standing in line at the supermarket looking at the most recent shocking celebrity news on the cover of Us or seeing the most recent clickbait links on me feed. I am addicted from the very beginning and I cannot wait for the next scandalous event to occur. And, she really does such a good job making it feel so real \u2013 I want to rush off and start Googling these people and then I remember they don\u2019t really exist!This book deals with some very sensitive topics: gender roles (women being treated differently than men), the historical stigma of homosexuality, sexuality in general (i.e. how it used to be shocking for women to be depicted enjoying sex or be blatantly sexual), racism, death/suicide, etc. I know that some of these topics can trigger people, but I think Reid does a great job of interweaving them into the story and showing how each affects the characters. None of it is unnecessary, overdone, or purely for shock value. Basically, Reid is just a fantastic storyteller. She pulls me in and doesn\u2019t let go. I don\u2019t want to put her books down and, when I do, I cannot wait to get back to them. I hope if you try her out, you have the same experiences I did.", "\nYOU.YES, YOU.DO YOU NOT LIKE WASTING YOUR TIME?ME NEITHER.SO READ THIS BOOK, GET TO KNOW EVELYN HUGO.YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.BYE.\n", "not to be dramatic, but if there ever comes a point in time where the fate of the human civilisation is coming to an end and we need to create a time capsule to immortalise our posterity, this book better be in it. there has never been a more honest and enthralling book in the history of the world, ever. i really dont even know where to begin. its books like this which confirm my belief that fiction will always be better than nonfiction, because it would be impossible to find a biography that could paint the story of a womans life half as well as this did. this was extraordinary, in every sense of the word. just the depth of this book was spectacular. not to mention the diversity and representation and writing quality and complex characters. everything was just outstanding. im kind of in that shocked state right now (if you didnt already notice) where im still reeling from what i just read. a more concise and coherent review will come once i calm down from being so hyped about the brilliance of this book and can process everything. \u21a0 5 stars", "Okay! I bought this in an Audible sale because of all the rave reviews! I better love it \ud83d\ude33 And I bought it on Kindle! Omg!! I can\u2019t believe I loved this as much as I did!! Once in awhile a book will surprise me. But I did the wrong thing! I listened to it first. I usually like to read it first so I can highlight things!! Soooo there will be a reread on my kindle. But the narrator for this did an awesome job! This was fantastic! Happy Reading! Mel \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3e", "4.5 stars but I very well may move it to a 5. This book was surprising, not in a \u201ctwist\u201d way but in how so much of it resonated with me. I saw a lot of the \u201ctwists\u201d coming but I believe that is entirely the point. It\u2019s not about the twists, it\u2019s about the journey and that is a marker for a great story imo. I desperately hope this gets made into a beautiful film. ", "This has been one of the most well-developed, character driven stories that I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s the type that\u2019ll leave a mark and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. Throughout the course of this book, I became enamoured with Evelyn Hugo. She isn\u2019t likeable, but I fell in love her. The whole story felt real. As if I could google one of her movies, and I\u2019d be able to start watching it right away. I was dazzled by her beauty, her bravado. I fell in love with her personality, her ugliness and facade of a life she lived for a while, and how accepting she became of the mistakes she made. She learned from it. This is what you call learning from your mistakes, accepting them and moving on. She didn\u2019t drown in regret, berate herself to the point where one can break oneself down. She dealt with her circumstances in the best way she could back then. She dealt with the cards that she was given in a way that made sense to her alone, but doesn\u2019t condone it either. However, it was her truth and she was unapologetic. There was so much strength in her character that seeped into me. (And Hollywood is just fuckin\u2019 dirty.) I also love the title of this book. I think anyone\u2019s initial reaction is to be slightly shocked. I mean, I believed it. Evelyn Hugo really did marry seven men. But this story highlights that there is always more to someone than what meets the eye and what others may perceive. I don\u2019t care how strong you are in your assumption towards someone. It\u2019s an assumption, a so-called opinion and it\u2019s flimsy at the of the day. The truth is that people are more complex, more layered and human. I think what I was missing though was the same type of intensity that I was feeling whilst reading the first half of the story - though I don\u2019t know how much importance I should place on the \u2018missing intensity\u2019. But I also wished that the plot twist was looked at with more depth. It felt like the story ended almost abruptly once that reveal was made and I needed it to be more fleshed out and come round full circle. But other than that, Evelyn Hugo, you are an icon. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The time has come for me to become acquainted with Evelyn Hugo.", "\n\n\u201cDon't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.\u201d\n\n Let me go ahead and say that I had no idea what to expect from this book. When it first released, I remember seeing it everywhere, and I honestly didn\u2019t take any interest in it until I was told about how diverse it was. It\u2019s full of incredible representation: you\u2019ve got bi rep, gay rep, lesbian rep, a Cuban woman, a biracial woman\u2014so when I heard about all of that, I finally decided to give it a try, and I\u2019m so glad that I did, because whatever I thought Evelyn Hugo was about, didn\u2019t hold a candle to the experience of reading it for myself. \n\n\u201cPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.\u201d\n\nThroughout the entire book, Evelyn is more or less laying her soul bare to Monique, this reporter who she\u2019s asked to write her life story. As this famous actress, Evelyn\u2019s memories are juicy and full of drama, hidden pains and secret triumphs, and most notably, her seven marriages\u2014not one of them having been to the hidden love of her life. Despite the descriptions she gives for judgments she received and the snippets of gossip articles laid out intermittently through the book, Evelyn isn\u2019t ashamed of herself in any way, and it creates this incredibly feminist, sex-positive atmosphere that I could\u2019ve soaked in forever.\n\n\u201cI made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.\u201d\n\nDespite Evelyn\u2019s status as this film goddess by this point, she feels so relatable and she manages to work even the celebrity aspects of her life into this narrative that anyone could understand, as she admits to the sins she committed and the lies she told, and even to the baser things like the fact that she realized early on, no amount of fame or fortune would ever truly satisfy a successful actress like herself. She constantly owns up to selfish motives and awful behaviors, yet she\u2019s tremendously likable, and I think that\u2019s a fact that points to how terrific Taylor Jenkins Reid\u2019s storytelling is: because we are hearing everything through Evelyn\u2019s memories, from the mouth of an elderly woman who has settled down and found peace, it makes it difficult to ever blame her for a single crime she committed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.\u201d\n\nOf course, Evelyn\u2019s not all bad\u2014she overcame circumstances that many people would\u2019ve simply given up under, and yet, she managed to love beautifully and to put her family first at every turn, even if the moves she made to protect them didn\u2019t always make sense on the surface. Whether it\u2019s her hidden love, or her endless commitment to her best friend, or her breathtaking adoration of her daughter, when you reach the end of the story and look back, it\u2019s easy to see that nothing mattered more to Evelyn than the people she held dear, and it makes her feel spectacularly human.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard business, reconciling what the truth used to be with what the truth is now.\u201d\n\nOf course, Evelyn isn\u2019t the only character who\u2019s enjoyable in this book; underneath her memories is the story of Monique, the reporter who\u2019s just trying to find her place in a world that doesn\u2019t like to make room for strong women, much less women of color striking out on their own. She grows so much in a short span of time, and while the circumstances of the writing process aren\u2019t always kind to her, and while she\u2019s never really the star of the show, you can\u2019t help but root for her, too\u2014and everyone else in this complex, layered, masterpiece of a book.\n\n\u201cYou have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.\u201d\n\nI feel like there is so much more that I want to say, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to one thing: The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most brilliant pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It sets itself so solidly apart from anything I\u2019ve ever read that even remotely resembled it, and is probably one of the most powerful, emotional, and incredible things I have ever read. I am forever grateful for each and every one of who you encouraged me to pick it up, and for Taylor Jenkins Reid, the genius behind the pages. I cannot recommend this highly enough.Buddy read with Meisha, Angie, and Delanna! \u2665", "REREAD 3/1/2019 i love this book so much i love this book so much i love this book so much THERE ARE TRULY NO WORDS FOR HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BOOKand YES I cried just as much the second time. WHAT. ABOUT. IT::FULL REVIEW BELOW ::Folks, this book just came into my home and murdered me personally I\u2019m shaking So, I literally cried for 20 minutes when listening this and not like cute little sniffles either I mean full on tears streaming down my face heaving sobs crying I'm talking having to keep wiping your eyes so you can see. I rarely get truly emotional in books so the fact this book drew that reaction from me is a testament to how fucking damn good it is. Like, please believe the hype peopleLike genuinely, I 100% believe if the fucking bus I was on had just HIT ME that would have been less painful then what happened in the last 20% of this bookanyway, it's like day 8 of trying to write this review but I keep restarting it because I don't know how to communicate how much I just loved this book so much but here goes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.\u201d \nthis is one of those books that you don't think you'll love so much and then it just surprises you and immediately steals your heart. \n\u2b50 it's so hard to explain what this book is about because it's so, so much more than I ever expected\nOn the basic level, it follows Monique, an up and coming journalist who has been invited to write a tell-all about the life of Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn Hugo is a retired Old Hollywood actress, fashion icon, sex symbol and known for her glamorous and scandalous life that included seven different marriages. Evelyn Hugo hasn't done an interview in decades but she insists that Monique write the tell-all and so the story is told both in flashbacks as Evelyn recounts her life through the seven marriages and current time as Monique tries to unravel why Evelyn Hugo, potentially the worlds most famous actress, wants her of all people to write this tell all. And listen, there is so, so much more happening then that but it's so, SO hard to explain. You just have to read it and trust me. Seriously I'm begging you, I'll go full Rumpelstiltskin and trade my first born for everyone to read this book because it is seriously incredible. \n\u201cPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.\u201d\nI think one thing that is so amazing about this is how real it is even though all these characters are fictitious they feel SO REAL. They're so well developed and nuanced. Evelyn Hugo, Harry Cameron, Celia St James and the other characters who appear are incredibly flawed and did some questionable things (especially Evelyn) and I loved that about it so much. The depth that Taylor Jenkins Reid gave these characters made them feel so, so alive. And it also made the pain I felt at their struggles and their joys that much more real. This book absolutely broke me because I was SO, SO invested in these characters. I care about each one of them so much and even though eight days later I MISS them like they're real. I keep wondering what they're up to and how they're feeling. Because Taylor Jenkins Reid sets this book right in the heart of the old Hollywood era, and makes them so compelling and realistic, it honestly feels like they're real actresses and actors and producers and I have to keep reminding myself they're not. That sounds literally ridiculous but thats how WELL WRITTEN these characters are. \n\u201cDon't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.\u201d \ndespite the hetero sounding title, this book is very gay a large portion of this is about Evelyn Hugo explaining her love and on/off relationship with fellow actress Celia St. James. And oh my god, I love them so much. And I loved the representation so much.I've mentioned I'm queer here before and this book really had me thinking. The book explores a little what it was like to be queer in Hollywood in this era and what it cost both Evelyn and Harry to hide their relationships. The incorporation of events like the Stonewall riots and the AIDs crisis, and showing how the community reacted to that, was upsetting but important. And it really highlighted how hard it was to be gay or bi or lesbian like these characters at the time. I think that was just something really important in this book and again, brought it up a level from a regular literary fiction book to something a bit more. I also just really loved the bisexual rep. Like, a lot. So many things Evelyn said really hit home for me, and the tensions betwene her and Celia were really relatable because I've experienced that that too. This is not OwnVoices but I did read an article in which Taylor Jenkins Reid explained her research, and you can definitely tell she took her time to gather first person experience, read memoirs and generally research to make sure she was doing this right and she did it SO RIGHT. This is probably one of my favourite lgbtq+ books of all time\n\u201cBut I like you this way. I like you impure and scrappy and formidable. I like the Evelyn Hugo who sees the world for what it is and then goes out there and wrestles what she wants out of it. So, you know, put whatever label you want on it, just don't change. That would be the real tragedy.\u201d\nOkay, I'm getting emotional again so lets leave it here. I love these messy, beautiful characters so much and I just ..... my heart is exploding thinking about all the HAPPINESS they deserved. If you think this book is something you won't like, I did too. I thought there was no way I would care about a literary fiction book focussing on Hollywood but OH. MY. gOD. It's so much more than you think it is and it truly both made and broke my heart. this is one of my favourite 2018 reads and also a new all time favourite, and I am so, so happy it exists.", "5 glamorous, glitzy, enamored beyond all reason stars!!!Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read along with a recipe for Caldo Gallego soup!My life has been broken up into two segments: before Evelyn and after.Where do I even start with this? If all of my enthusiasm and relentless energy could be compressed into a grenade I would pull the pin out for The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and burst into a show of sparkles and champagne bubbles. I don't even know how to concisely put into words how much this book did the damn thing for me.So do yourself a favor and learn how to grab life by the balls, dear. Don't be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.Evelyn Hugo. She's a magnetic, luscious, complicated and layered character beyond all reason. How Reid was able to fit such a huge personality into only 386 pages is honestly beyond me. I didn't just want to read about Evelyn, I wanted to know her. I want to bask in her greatness, revel in her strengths and ponder her weaknesses and lessons with her.It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.Evelyn Hugo. She spent her entire life working tirelessly and mercilessly to fight her way to the top of the food chain during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She's nearing the end of her life and she's finally ready to tell all about her triumphs and failures and she chooses a down-on-her-luck, little-known, surprise-to-everyone writer named Monique Grant to tell that story.All I've ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. But you've never been mine. Not really. I've always had to settle for one piece of you. While the world gets the other half. I don't blame you. It doesn't make me stop loving you. But I can't do it. I can't do it, Evelyn. I can't live with my heart half-broken all the time.EVELYN FREAKIN' HUGO. Her story resonated with me and spoke lessons to me I didn't even realize I needed. Evelyn simply wants what most of us do, she wants to be seen. It is an ache within in her that transcends the words on the page and nestles itself into the heart of the reader.While this is told from Monique's POV, Evelyn is the one weaving the tale. When Monique learns that Evelyn is ready to give a tell-all interview to her and her alone we see many parallels between these two women. Monique has her own lessons to learn, her own battles to fight and Evelyn unknowingly turns into a guiding light in Monique's life.Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn't like to to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?It was truly effortless to love Evelyn and this cast of characters. At it\u2019s heart this is a love story, a tale of redemption and a saga of loss and heartbreak. It tackles an insane amount of timely topics with a deft and delicate hand. Reid has truly outdone herself. This book takes homophobia, racism, sexism, trauma, abuse and a whole lot more and highlights and honors the struggles of those experiencing these ugly truths of our society.This book. Who am I now? What do I do with my life in this new stage of After Evelyn? This is easily the newest member of my favorites shelf and my new go-to recommendation for other readers. This book isn't hyped, it's properly praised for the literary masterpiece it is. I'm now facing one of the worst book hangovers of my life because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Evelyn and her story. Reid crafted Evelyn\u2019s character in a way that those around her could never get enough and she did so in such a spectacularly efficient fashion that readers wont be able to either. Evelyn always leaves you hoping you'll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.Pick it up, I suggest this for anyone with the capability of reading or absorbing literature through any medium. I'll just be over here, weeping quietly at the beauty and magnificence that was this story.", "\nI finished this at 3am and then cried myself to sleep. This was truly remarkable. Evelyn Hugo is a character I won't get out of my head for a long time.\n", "4.5 starsDon't read this book on your period. Just don't. Take my advice. Spare yourself the grief and agony.Every time I closed this book and my brain snapped back to the present, it took me a couple of seconds to remember that Evelyn isn\u2019t a real person. A fictional biography is such a genius idea, and it was done so expertly. I have zero interest in movies or Hollywood (cite literally any tweet about me hating watching movies and not caring about actors), but this book and the setting and characters enchanted me. I wanted to turn on La Vie En Rose in the background as I read it just to get in the Mood.This is the first book I\u2019ve read in a while where I sat and read without touching my phone for 2+ hours, praying that time would pass slower so I could fit in more pages before I had to go to sleep. Part of why I was so addicted is because the writing of this book just demands attention. It\u2019s flowing almost to the point of conversational, more like a memoir than a novel. And although I flew through the prose, part of me questions whether the flashback sections resemble the tone and voice of an older Hollywood star. A lot of the lingo and style of relating a story seemed modern, and maybe I\u2019m just overthinking, but it took away a bit from the authenticity of the story for me. Maybe it would have worked better being told in third person as if it were Monique's writing, but something about the voice of Evelyn's memories didn't sit right with me.I like how this book uses the perspective of hindsight. Evelyn using her wisdom to call out when she was being mistreated and all the unjust and toxic things that occurred to her constructed a powerful narrative. I applaud this book talking about feminism, abusive relationships, abortions, and bisexual erasure, among plenty other things. I can see why it's highly praised in that respect. The discussion of moral greyness and the corruption and scheming of Hollywood and fame and unabashed conceit and fame was also fascinating. I love the light in which it was painted. It was very take it or leave it, which was so different because usually, books do the most to try and convince you of a character being starkly good or bad. This book let you assume whatever you wanted to about the characters, which I respected.Lastly, the most satisfying thing about this book is watching the growth of Monique alongside Evelyn telling her story. Being honest, I didn't think I was going to like Evelyn at first, but I realized the same quality that makes her a rude and off-putting character also makes her powerful and memorable. I grew to love her snark and confrontational dialogue, even though I would likely be terrified of her in person.It's hard to wrap up this review because I want to say that I loved it as much as everyone else, but I can't quite put my finger on why it wasn't a full five stars. Still, I highly recommend it.", "I\u2019m just sobbing on my couch. No big deal. I\u2019ve been emotionally gutted, but whatever. This book had two of the most wonderfully fascinating complex female characters I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reading about, BUT ILL BE FINE", "Redownloaded the audiobook - Is it too soon to read this again??? Reviews can be found at: www.booknerdtan.wordpress.comNo doubt...5/5 stars.... Read from start to finish and reviewed in one day, if that doesn't say everything I don't know what will. This review will probably just be a load of rambling nonsense as I'm writing it straight after finishing the book and I'm overwhelmed with what I've just read.\u00a0I loved everything about this wonderful story; the well developed characters, the juicy plot, the interesting way in which it was written and the twist that I never saw coming- all of this from the very start had me totally hooked. To be totally honest, I picked this up because I wanted some light hearted chic lit and whoa did I get way more than I bargained for.I think what hit me the most about this book was how much I felt for every character in it and the relationships that Evelyn built with them. The different types of connections and love you can feel for others really resonated and the characters just felt so real to me. I think maybe after everything Evelyn Hugo did throughout her life, we should feel some kind of animosity towards her, however I cannot help but absolutely adore her and everything she did for herself and others.The entire story from start to finish was so captivating, juicy and dramatic that I managed to finish it in one day as it completely consumed me and I wasn't able to do anything else all day. I loved the way there were articles and reports about Evelyn throughout her career entwined in the story, it really added to the way the story was delivered. I loved the way sexuality was addressed with such raw honesty and transparency and gave some insight into just how far people will go for the people they love.The ending to the book was just beautiful and brought all the tears. This may be my favourite book of 2018 so far. A book I can say is actually worth all the hype that is surrounding it and my heart feels a lot more full right now. What a stunning book.", "Wow. I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. Absolutely LOVED it. This is a story of a powerful love between two women in a time when it was unacceptable. The author has a huge command of language and seamlessly shifts from first person present tense to first person past tense and even to second person. Amazing. I marveled at the writing craft, the storytelling. The language and the passion to communicate the love is mesmerizing. The main character Evelyn Hugo is a swirling whirlwind that pulls everyone that comes near into her vortex. Even though Evelyn Hugo does some truly heinous things, the justification and motivation is clear and we pull full her. The atmosphere, setting and flavor of old Hollywood is captured in just enough detail. The underlying plotline, the mystery that was carried along and always there lurking really paid off in the end. In all the thousands of books I have read in my life time I have found very few that have been able to pay-off with the last line of the book. This author does it with stunning panache and verve. Loved it. For me this book is a true \u201ctear-jerk-er,\u201d as my mother used to call them. (She was married five times, so I might\u2019ve had a little insider experience with Evelyn Hugo. Mom, married three Jim\u2019s, a Bill and a Bob. The third, and last was a Jim and my sisters nicknamed him Jim de jour. Sorry I digress).This one is going up in my top five of the year.Highly recommend this book.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series.", " A conversation between me and Google because: Why not?Google: What can I do for you today?me: Search for the actress Evelyn Hugo.Google: Isn't that a fictional character?me: Wha..What do you mean?

It's like watching a beautiful black and white movie where every character is complex, painfully human and most importantly NOT STRAIGHT.After hating so many hyped books lately, I'm happy to say that: \nThe hype is deserved!\n It's even deserving of more hype. I loved how beautiful this book was and I'm not talking about the writing. It's the sadness and pain that brings this book to life and even more than that: The Characters.Evelyn Hugo is ready to bare it all in this book. I wanted to take all the secrets she revealed, keep them close to my chest and protect them from this ugly reality. She's complex. She's cruel. She's passionate. She's human. And if you don't understand all of her. You don't desreve to love her. And God Did I fall head over heels for her! She's hands down:  The best female character I've ever read about.On her way to fame, she lost so much of herself. Hurt so many people. And she's completly unapologetic. Married seven guys yet loved only one person. Someone she wasn't allowed to have. But who she loved anyway. If love is the only word to express what they felt for each other than that's what we will call it, even if it was so much more.Harry, her best friend is my spirit animal. Celia, with all of her passion is someone I would've loved to get to know.I loved every character except for: Monique. The journalist. If she's a journalist I should be an author by now. How can someone be so stupid, is beyond me.This book will break you in all the right ways. But you will be happy that you've read something so beautiful. I definitely recommend this to everyone.\nThank you for reading this review! and I hope you have an amazing life.\n", "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a 2017 Atria Books publication.A story so well written I had to remind myself it was a work of fiction. The cleverly titled novel appealed to my interest in old Hollywood, the scandals and cover-ups the public never had the slightest clue existed. Evelyn Hugo is a faded movie star in advanced years who has decided to write her life story- a deliciously scandalous tell all with a sharp focus on her seven marriages. To help with this task, she lures Monique Grant to her home under false pretenses, but soon seduces her into agreeing to take the job, by making her an offer she couldn\u2019t resist. The story moves slowly at first while Evelyn settles into her story and Monique learns how to handle Evelyn, often using Evelyn\u2019s own advice against her to gain leverage. But, once they have come to an understanding, Evelyn\u2019s story takes center stage and what a story it was. The first question Monique asked Evelyn is:\u2018Who was the great love of your life?'It seems like a reasonable enough question, considering Evelyn\u2019s numerous marriages, but it turns out to be much more complicated than what it may seem on the surface. I admit, I sat literally spellbound and mesmerized by Evelyn and her turbulent life as an actress and movie star, and the amazing twists and turns her life took in search of personal peace, love, and contentment. Her storytelling was an Academy Award performance. Evelyn made concessions along the way to fame, allowing herself to be recreated by erasing her Cuban heritage and features, as well as leaving her first husband for a chance at fame and fortune. Her love life takes many twists and turns as does her career, but what the public witnessed was nothing at all like what went on behind closed doors. Her life was like the old Hollywood is all \u2018smoke and mirrors\u2019 adage personified.While Monique is the interviewer, her life and background deserves a close look. She is depressed over her failed marriage and her seemingly dead -end position at work. This gig is worth the incredible risk she takes, but she could never have guessed the monumental impact Evelyn Hugo would have on her life. Naturally, I thought of Elizabeth Taylor and her many marriages, but the story also had a hint of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s humble beginnings as well. However, a few of Evelyn's leading men mimicked or could have been modeled after real movie stars from that era as well.  But, the most significant points come from the relationships Evelyn developed, outside of the public eye, and how they managed to keep the situation a secret for so many years. Each husband is given their own chapter with a special title that applies to them personally or to Evelyn\u2019s relationship or opinion of them. I disliked many of them, and really loved others, as did Evelyn. But beware of Evelyn\u2019s spin on things. She is determined to tell this tale her way and her outlook is often a matter of perspective. As things progress, I began to see how Evelyn\u2019s influence on Monique begins to take hold. She gives good advice even if it sounds selfish, greedy, or cold. She didn\u2019t get to be the great \u2018Evelyn Hugo\u2019 without some verve. Although there are strong passages regarding sexuality, and the hidden secret lives people were forced to resort to in those days, for me, the powerful transformation Monique undergoes under Evelyn\u2019s tutelage is what sticks with me the most. Now, this story could have worked as a fictional tell all from Hollywood\u2019s golden age, but there are a couple of 'Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night'moments you won\u2019t see it coming, which left me utterly speechless and completely flabbergasted. My emotions exploded in a million different directions at that point. The conclusion is riddled with rich bittersweet irony, but couldn't have been more fitting. Overall, this is an incredibly well written story, very atmospheric, multi-layered, thought provoking, and utterly hypnotizing. Someday, I would like to re-read this one so I can absorb all those nuances I missed leading up to that stunning conclusion. This one was so good I had a little book hangover for a couple of days.

A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499277281l/5.jpg", "title": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "authors": "J.K.

I love it. Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MAN. THIS BOOK IS SO MY FAVORITE.The phone conversation at the beginning between Ron and Uncle Vernon was PRICELESS. I wish so much that that scene had been in the movie.I was so into reading this book that I failed to take notes, so I don't have many specifics to add except that I love how Crookshanks was basically Sirius's secret agent spy cat friend and I LOVE THAT.Also, this book demonstrated some very REAL aspects of school. For example, Hermione took on too much work, and she gradually started to go crazy (and consequently distanced herself from her friends, became more moody, and then finally just bitch-slapped Malfoy). I also found Oliver Wood to be hilarious in this book for similar reasons: this was his last year at Hogwarts, and he wanted nothing more than to win the Quidditch Cup so he could have some sort of glory at Hogwarts, and he became so consumed by it (as I'm sure lots of people on sports teams do). The way he was so emotionally invested really cracked me up but also felt so real. Side note: CEDRIC IS SO DAMN NICE. when he realized that Harry fell off his broom during the Quidditch game and Hufflepuff won he called for a rematch, which says a lot about him, and it just makes what happens in the next book that much worse.But of course, all of the Marauders stuff made my inner fangirl go nuts because it has to be my favorite Harry Potter storyline.

Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.\nHarry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no \u2026 their last hope was gone.\nI know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how I did it,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\u2019t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn\u2019t suck it out of me \u2026 but it kept me sane.\nI think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters", "\n(A) 85% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A flavorful foreboding, it plies expanded bandwidth, like ripened fruit, and more acute: a sweet and spicy sandwich.\n", "\nI have so much more love for this one re-reading it as an adult.

It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.\n\n\u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\u201d \n\nI was 16 years old, and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations. My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter. (Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). Before I tell you about my experience, I need to make a confession. It was my choice to stay away from J.K. Rowling's books until that moment. I wanted to swim against the current, and I thought that Harry Potter was too \"mainstream\" for my taste. And the foolish little me was proud of this decision. But when my teacher gave me this old, used copy, something inside me cracked. I knew the basics about the story, about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly, evil dude who doesn't have a nose. But page by page, I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn't want to offers more than that; he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently. I stayed up late at night, with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences, and I cheered for Gryffindor's Quidditch team, I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to Pottermore it's a brown mastiff, which is oddly fitting). I casted spells (but never Avada Kedavra, you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and just like that, my life had changed irrevocably. I was a Potterhead. And I was proud of that. (my mum wasn't though, especially when I asked for a wand).\n\n\u201cHappiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason why J.K. Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide. Friendship, love, hope, they're present in her books even in the most desperate times, when Evil seems undefeatable, when no escape is visible. She encourages and empowers, shows that everything is possible, that strength and courage can be found within, when you have someone to hold your hand. Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving, it took him years but he finally found a place to belong, to feel safe and cared. Ron, with his witty lines and his constant presence, Hermione, my personal favorite, with her intelligence and compassion, they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart, and even now, years later, I'm still under their spell. I think I will always be.\n\n\u201cDon't let the muggles get you down.\u201d\n\nI'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter, and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame. I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books (meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half) and laugh at Harry Potter jokes. And I know, and it's imprinted in my soul, that I'll never be a muggle again.", "\nRe-read 1/19/19: Idk what happened this time around but I SOBBED for the last 50 pages of this?????

For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard\u00bbSirius Black's escape from Azkaban prison is on every wizard's lips. Not even the dreaded guards of the prison, the Dementors, managed to keep in a cage the wicked wizard, who probably want to meet again his master, Voldemort. But to do that, firstly he must kill Harry Potter, the only one capable to stand up to Voldemort... Meanwhile, the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry, Ron and hermione will become acquainted with two new professors...Compared to the previous, the third volume of the series is the one that is richer in twists and turns. I'm reading the saga of Harry Potter to my daughter, when in the evening she goes to bed, and in this \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" a little tragedy happened. When we got to \"The kiss of the dementor\" chapter, just hearing the title my daughter (6 years old) was so upset by what it might happen that she required that I read that chapter alone, and just then telling her what was going on by omitting the scary details. Apart from this hiccup, the reading was neat and clean. It is evident that the playful and carefree tones of the first two adventures give way to dark colors. After all harry is growing up, and its way of seeing things is supposed to change as well. Rowling takes us in the maturation process of the most famous little wizard of the world using the same plot device of the previous volumes: the teachings of Headmaster Dumbledore, the clashes with Malfoy, the bickering with Hermione, the conflicts with Professor Snape. I do not know if in the near future I will continue to read to my daughter the Harry Potter saga, or if I will wait she grows enough to read it alone to avoid upsetting her again. Never mind. I will go on because now it is not possible for me to stop reading, with the pleasant awareness that there is no healthier addiction of this one. \"Get high\" yourself too.Vote: 10\n\n\n\n\n\u00abHarry Potter era un ragazzo insolito sotto molti punti di vista. Prima di tutto, odiava le vacanze estive pi\u00f9 di qualunque altro periodo dell'anno. Poi voleva davvero fare i compiti, ma era costretto a studiare di nascosto, nel cuore della notte. E per giunta era un mago\u00bbLa fuga di Sirius Black dalla prigione di Azkaban \u00e8 sulla bocca di tutti i maghi. Nemmeno i temuti guardiani del carcere, i Dissennatori, sono riusciti a tenere in gabbia il malvagio stregone, che si dice voglia riunirsi al suo padrone, Voldemort. Per farlo per\u00f2 dovr\u00e0 prima eliminare Harry Potter, l'unico che fino ad ora \u00e8 stato in grado di tenere testa a Voldemort... Nel frattempo, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per cominciare il nuovo anno scolastico, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione faranno la conoscenza di due nuovi professori...Rispetto ai due precedenti, il terzo volume della serie \u00e8 quello pi\u00f9 ricco di colpi di scena, e di conseguenza quello con il ritmo pi\u00f9 serrato. Sto leggendo la saga di Harry Potter a mia figlia quando la sera va a letto, ed in questo \"Harry Potter e il Prigioniero di Azkaban\" \u00e8 successa una piccola tragedia. Arrivati al capitolo \"il bacio del dissennatore\", al solo sentire il titolo mia figlia (6 anni) \u00e8 rimasta cos\u00ec turbata da quello che sarebbe potuto accadere che ha preteso che lo leggessi io da solo, e che le raccontassi quello che succedeva omettendo i particolari spaventosi. A parte questo intoppo, la lettura \u00e8 continuata liscia. E' evidente che i toni giocosi e spensierati delle prime due avventure lasciano il posto a sfumature a tratti cupe e goticheggianti. D'altronde Harry sta crescendo, e si suppone che cambi anche il suo modo di vedere le cose. La Rowling ci accompagna nel processo di maturazione del maghetto pi\u00f9 famoso del mondo utilizzando gli stessi espedienti narrativi usati negli altri volumi: gli insegnamenti di Silente, gli scontri con Malfoy, i battibecchi con Hermione, i conflitti con Piton. Non so se nell'immediato futuro continuer\u00f2 a leggere a mia figlia la saga di Harry Potter, o se aspetter\u00f2 che cresca abbastanza da essere in grado di leggerseli da sola per evitare adesso di turbarla. Non importa. Io andr\u00f2 avanti perch\u00e8 per me non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 possibile fermarmi, con la piacevole consapevolezza che non esiste dipendenza pi\u00f9 salutare di questa. \"Drogatevi\" anche voi.Voto: 10", "\u201cHappiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\u201dAs it seems my Harry Potter reviews don\u2019t always start with a Dumbledore quote but always end up being \u201cMy thoughts about this book\u201d reviews as well. For a series like HP that\u2019s been read by so many people this might be the best solution though. And because the books get longer and longer and because I don\u2019t share my friend Jayson\u2019s amazing and remarkable ability to describe a book in one significant sentence, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to bear with quite a lot of my thoughts. *lol*1.) \u201dIt\u2019s one of the basic rules of breeding,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see it all the time with dogs. If there\u2019s something wrong with the bitch, there\u2019ll be something wrong with the pup-\u201cAunt Marge is such a horrible person!!! If you ask me she\u2019s really lucky that Harry is such a precious cinnamon roll and only made her a big bubble gum. *lol* The audacity to talk about his dead parents like that! No wonder Harry got so angry!! Aunt Marge can float to hell! 2.) \u201dI\u2019ve already had some,\u201d said Harry. \u201cProfessor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.\u201d\u201cDid he, now?\u201d said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \u201cSo we\u2019ve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.\u201dLupin is the best DADA teacher they ever had and I love him so much! <333 His character is just great and I wish we would have seen even more of him. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t blessed with all too many Lupin scenes. >_<3.) \u201dHow extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\u201d Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \u201cHe, too, was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers\u2026 the resemblance between you is uncanny.\u201dAnd speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst! Snape is such a horrible teacher I can\u2019t even! I said it once and I\u2019ll say it again: He's cruel, he's a bully, he takes delight in instilling fear in his students. And he verbally and emotionally abuses them. His personal vendetta against Harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy! Movie Snape is way nicer than the one in the books and I'm sorry but if you ask me #SnapeCan'tBeRedeemed\"!!4.) \u201dThey\u2019ve got a new captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory-\u201cAngelina, Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Wood, frowning at this light-hearted behaviour.\u201cHe\u2019s that tall, good-looking one, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Angelina.It\u2019s the third book and Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang are already mentioned! Also did anyone notice that they are both introduced as Seekers as well? ;-) So we have all the main players for book 4! Harry, Draco, Cho and Cedric! XD (On a side note: Considering the giggling girls Robert Pattinson truly is a good cast! *lol*) 5.) \u201dYou asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don\u2019t want to be told?\u201dRon never ceases to amaze me! He\u2019s such a shy guy but boy does he become a lion when he defends the people he cares about! <3 6.) \u201dDementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can\u2019t see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you.\u201dThe Dementor\u2019s Kiss reminded me of one of my rp characters that died through one. Ahh the good old roleplay times. *lol* Anyway, moving on! I was always intrigued by the idea of Dementors and even after so many years their existence and mystery still didn\u2019t lose its appeal! They are really fascinating creatures and even though I never want to meet one I still can\u2019t help but take an interest in them. =) Certainly one of the best things about this book! 7.) \u201dMr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people\u2019s business.\u201dThe first mention of the Marauder\u2019s Map! \u201cThe Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d is certainly one of those main books that build the foundation for everything that\u2019s yet to come. And it\u2019s already way darker than its predecessors. Bless Fred and George for handing Harry the map! Heaven knows he\u2019ll have good use for it in the years to come. ;-P8.) \u201dThey\u2019re dead,\u201d he told himself sternly. \u201cThey\u2019re dead, and listening to echoes of them won\u2019t bring them back.\u201dIt always kills me to read about how Harry struggles with the knowledge - or rather the lack of knowledge - about his parents. My heart bleeds for him whenever they are mentioned. I mean jeez, he\u2019d endure a Dementor just to hear their voices. T_T9.) \u201cShe\u2019s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an\u2019 you two not talkin\u2019 to her \u2013\u201c Is it just me or is this actually a reoccurring theme? Since book one there always seem to be sections in which they don\u2019t talk to each other because something gets in their way. And if my memory serves me right things are going to continue in this vein. XD 10.) \u201dShe had slapped Malfoy around the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered.\u201dOnce again I want to point out that I\u2019m a pacifist! The way Hermione dished out that slap was pretty spectacular though! *lol* Guess she took Mr. Weasley as an example. Haha! Sound advice for parents: You better don\u2019t slap mean people in front of your kids! ;-P Also is it just me or did anyone else notice the irony of the situation? A person like Hermione, a person that values words, resorted to actions because she realized words won\u2019t get her far with a Malfoy. *lol* 11.) \u201dTHIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING-\u201c\u201cJordan, if you can\u2019t commentate in an unbiased way-!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling it like it is, Professor!\u201dJordan\u2019s Quidditch commentary is legit one of the best things about the series! Well and the matches themselves of course. XD Plus McGonagall swearing like a trooper because the Slytherin team was playing so foul is one of the best things ever! Haha! Especially because she obviously tried to keep everything objective and neutral at first. *lol*11.) (view spoiler)[\u201dI\u2019m not doing this for you, I\u2019m doing it because I don\u2019t reckon my dad would\u2019ve wanted his best friends to become killers \u2013 just for you.\u201dHarry is a far better person than many others would have been! Even after everything Wormtail did he still didn\u2019t allow Sirius and Lupin to kill him. He would have had every reason to let them finish him off yet he thought of the consequences for his father\u2019s best friends first. Aside from that I still believe that Harry would have never allowed them to kill him because he knows it\u2019s not right. If he proved anything to us by now, then it\u2019s that he\u2019s a very righteous and compassionate person. (hide spoiler)]12.) (view spoiler)[\u201dI don\u2019t want a bond with Pettigrew!\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe betrayed my parents!\u201d\u201cThis is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me\u2026 the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\u2019s life.\u201dOnce again the foreshadowing!!! Rowling is a master at this discipline! XD (hide spoiler)]I can\u2019t wait to read \u201cThe Goblet of Fire\u201d! Not just because it\u2019s one of my favourite HP books but also because I want to find out which other details I missed the first time around!

Just this week I mentioned to people that I have been running on fumes with all the things I had to get done. If only I had a few extra hours in my week to take a nap or rest with a book. Thankfully, we have a leap year, providing our busy lives with a full extra day to get those things done that may have been pushed to the back burner. Whether it\u2019s catching up on sleep, reading, or chores, a leap year creates the impression that there is indeed an extra day to accomplish those things that may have been pushed to the wayside. Despite this, adults rarely have the time to go back and savor favorite books, but, in 2020 a group of us in Retro Chapter Chicks have decided to take the time to reread Harry Potter in all its glory. I find it appropriate that on a day where we can enjoy extra time, that I curled up with my favorite book in the series, one that indeed tests the limit of place and time. A mass murderer has escaped from prison. The news is so important that it even made the Muggle news. Even Muggles who detest magic like the Dursleys are on high alert. For Harry Potter, a wizard about to enter his third year at Hogwarts, it is just another summer vacation. Although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school, at the Dursleys he is treated like less than human. His living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals. Even though Aunt Petunia is Harry\u2019s blood relative, she also treats him like vermin. Things couldn\u2019t get any worse until Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge arrives for a weeklong visit, and she believes that Harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family. What Marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that Harry did not exist. Harry\u2019s true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic: his Hogwarts family. Each summer, life at Dursleys grows unbearable and Marge\u2019s treatment of Harry puts things over the top. In a fit of teenage emotions, Harry causes Marge to blow up, and then he leaves the Dursleys home, for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time. Normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school, but, with a murderer named Sirius Black on the loose, the Minister of Magic himself has bent the rules in Harry\u2019s favor. Minister Cornelius Fudge believes that Black is a dark wizard and servant of Lord Voldemort, and, in his eyes, the safest place for Harry is at Hogwarts under the watchful eyes of Albus Dumbledore. Harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the Dursleys and will indeed get to return to Hogwarts to continue his magical education. With the addition of Black to the storyline, the stories only get darker. Readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from Azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors, creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them. Fudge is convinced that Black is after Harry and has stationed dementors outside of Hogwarts, much to Dumbledore\u2019s chagrin. As long as Dumbledore is headmaster, dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with Voldemort. Black was able to outsmart them, and all of England is on high alert. It is against this backdrop and protection that Harry returns to Hogwarts. Third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms. They are allowed to visit the village of Hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form; the Dursleys did not. Yet, they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine enroll in Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, taught by none other than Hagrid. Hermoine also begins the study of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies. Harry and Ron do not understand how anyone, even one as smart as Hermoine, could take that many classes. Some are at the same time as others, which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once. The dialogue between Ron and Hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two, a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize. Meanwhile, class work has gotten harder. Professor Snape loathes Harry more than ever, and the new Defense of the Dark Arts professor Lupin is an old friend of Harry\u2019s father. Hagrid, while the nicest person around and Harry\u2019s protector, is threatened by the Malfoys yet again, this time after Draco is scratched by a hippogriff named Buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class. Buckbeak is threatened with execution, adding to the animosity between Harry and Draco, and only Hermoine, on top of her grueling class schedule, finds the time to assist Hagrid in his defense. All these storylines would make for an exciting tale, but inserting Lupin and Black and Harry\u2019s anti-dementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series. The story progresses, and animals play a key role in plot development: Ron\u2019s rat, Hermoine\u2019s cat, and a large black dog. The three are infinitely linked to one another. Rowling reveals that Black was the Potters\u2019 secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to Voldemort. He was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named Peter Pettigrew. He is also Harry\u2019s godfather. This information has Harry\u2019s growing teenaged emotions on high. He is more determined than ever to defeat Voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness. Although teenaged pranks occur in this book, my favorite scenes are between Harry and Lupin and Black. Being able to interact with one of his parents\u2019 closest friends, one really feels for Harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the Dursleys. As Rowling will reveal much, much later, Dumbledore has his reasons for placing Harry there, but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return, even if the presence of these Muggles is key to the plot line. Time, of course, plays a key role in the plot as well. Hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone. Sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book. He is innocent, yet the only people who believe him are Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and Professor Dumbledore. Lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf, and it is Pettigrew who is the servant of Lord Voldemort. This, Dumbledore explains to Harry, is magic at its deepest, most impenetrable moments and, in my opinion, the essence of the entire series. As Dumbledore points out time and again, it is one\u2019s choices that determine one\u2019s fate, not their abilities. For a few glorious moments Harry believes that he can live with Sirius and escape the Dursleys once and for all; it is the most touching moment, and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at Hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. Yet, this moment is indeed fleeting. The Ministry of Magic still believes that Sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on Buckbeak the innocent Hippogriff. Readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because Harry and Sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time. It makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading. Pretending that I do not know what comes next; however, knowing that Sirius and Lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book, a crossroads between the end of Harry\u2019s adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon. Time. J.K. Rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days. Most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. The climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest. This year\u2019s leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that I needed after a busy week. Even in this busy life that I lead, I have found the time to visit Harry Potter\u2019s magical world yet again. As the plot moves deeper into Harry\u2019s teenaged years, and, he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil, it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind. It is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all. 5+ stars All time favorite book", "\u201cHappiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\u201dWhen I finished Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the first time, it immediately became my next favourite book. J. K. Rowling outdid herself, and wrote something even bigger and better than before. And she'll keep doing it for another 4 books.There's just nothing to criticise about book 3. Compared to the other books there's not a single scene that makes me uncomfortable, that I'd prefer to skip rather than experience it again. I particularly admire Hermione, our favourite genius witch. Keeping all those immense secrets, kicking butt, being the best student of her age, suffering Ron's sideswipes and punching Malfoy in the face can't ever be beaten. Hermione seriously managed her mischief.Find more of my books on Instagram", "\nLoved it, duh. It's my favorite in the series and I'm not sure I got anything NEW out of this reread except some reminders on what a dick Snape is + how Crookshanks was MVP in getting the passwords to Sirius Black.\n", "This home prison a.k.a voluntarily quarantine making cookies and throwing them into trash days( I never say I\u2019m a good cook and each day I\u2019m getting worse!) giving me nostalgic vibes. It\u2019s like living never ending mercury retrograde! You don\u2019t want to start a new thing, you have to go back to your past or you have to deal with your unfinished businesses.  Of course this is not a book from my TBR or DNF list. I\u2019ve read it very same day it has been released: 16 freaking years ago when I was still hot, dump, in my silly 20\u2019s . The year I finished it, I flipped my bird to my managers at the workplace and quitted for chasing my writing dreams. (It was not entertaining, sunshine and rainbow story, there is so much rebellion, pain, fight, humiliation but freedom never comes without dues to pay!) And after devouring this book in one day( because I locked myself at my childhood room. Yes, I was single! It was easier to isolate yourself!) and I decided that\u2019s my all time favorite Harry Potter book (I know there were more to come but my life was changing and my three musketeers\u2019 lives were also going different directions. They were finally growing up, just like me!)  Sirius Black has a special place in my heart and at the beginning he escaped from Azkaban and we think he was after Harry to kill him. This book faces Harry\u2019s past trauma about his family, his guilt feelings, night terror, his self insecurities and sometimes we think his inner demons were more terrifying than the outside world\u2019s vicious, dangerous avengers coming after him. And at the end, Harry and Sirius\u2019s special relationship always melts my heart and fills my eyes in tears. I always find this is one of the most meaningful and genuine relationships JKR formed between two characters.  And we also see the growing pains of two main characters: Ron always loyal, likable, witty and Hermione is passionate, intelligent but also kind-hearted. Maybe this is the best part of their story because after this book, everything gets bleaker, darker and more violent! My dear three musketeers\u2019 lives will never be the same. I read this book 16 years by locking myself in my room and as a de je vu or reenactment of my younger and dumber self, I reread my favorite HP book. I smiled, entertained, cried, jumped, horrified again! And I felt good and gave my five gazillion stars over and over again! In these days, the best thing you gotta do: sticking with the things that makes you happy and rekindle your past experiments by making a visit to your memory lane with a great book!That\u2019s what I did and it worked so well with me!", "Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. \"I don't know why I even bother,\" he muttered to himself. \"I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?\"He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. \"A-HA!\" he yowled. \"Gotcha!\" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. \"Where you gonna run to now, ratty?\" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. \"Please,\" it said. \"Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!\"\"A mistake, eh?\" the cat said. \"We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....\"He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. \"Think, Peter, think,\" he said. \"Gotta get out of here, but...\" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. \"You may just have given me my way out, cat,\" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. \"They'll think it was you,\" he said. \"They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord.\" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. \"It's not safe here anymore.\" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. \"If I were human,\" he said, \"the fall would kill me. But as a rat....\" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better...", "Buddy Re-read with the Queens of Hogwarts on Instagram*********************I guess you can tell from my rating that this wasn't my all-time favorite HP installment, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I remember thinking that the movie was about a 3/5 star rating for me when I first saw it, but now that I've experienced the novel version, I can see how the ending in the book is so much more detailed and excellent than how they chose to portray the ending in the movie. Obviously I live for any appearance of the Weasley twins, and I was so excited to get to the book that features the marauder's map. \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!\" Another fun read and another step closer to making my way through the series for the first time.

It has to be epic! *Rolling eyes but smiling widely* xD\n", "This is my favourite book in the Harry Potter series! It marks a distinct change in tone and a maturation of the writing. As the characters grew older, the challenges they faced became more dark and intense. The plot became murkier especially in regard to Sirius and his involvement (or lack thereof) in the murders of Potter\u2019s parents. It all just got so much better. I think this is a large part of Rowling\u2019s success. She could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two, but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow. And her readers rejoice. This is also the first time the real threat to Harry is realised. Sure, we\u2019ve seen Voldemort on the back of Professor Quirrel\u2019s head and we saw an early Tom Riddle in the form of Horcorux diary type thing, but the dementors were an entirely different level of danger. The entire story felt less comic and less feel-good, for the first time it seemed like Harry Potter could actually die if he didn\u2019t find his courage and repel them with his power. He owed much to Lupin here, a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses, but a hugely pivotal one in the development of Harry. And, for me, that\u2019s why this one is the best because eit is the one where Harry truly found his confidence.

I mean, can you imagine having sex with this man?Well, I have. Several times.

I love the first two books in this series, but I love them for their magical quality, their appeal to children, and their overall introduction to this world.But The Prisoner of Azkaban, at least for me, marks the shift into adolescence and the less tidy endings.And, of course, the introduction of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to the plot.I loved rereading this third book the past two weeks with my middle child, and I can not get over this new set of the illustrated series by Jim Kay.

IT WAS SO FUCKING WONDERFUL AND I CRIED. I have several things to say about this book, but first of all, I'm going to say that I love the Marauders, except Peter Pettigrew because he's a fucking a coward and he made Lily and James died! I hate him so much and when Sirius voice broke after he told Harry what truly happened that he was not their Secret Keeper, but it was Peter and then he found out that Lily and James died, I felt like my heart was cracking and I wanted to hug him and said to him that it was not his fault. Oh God, I just feel really sorry for Sirius. \nRemus Lupin is such a sweet character\nHe is honestly the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! and he was also a caring and a sweet guy. He often smiled. He's smart, fun, and kind! he defended Neville when Snape bullied him or whatever that was because he kind of underestimated Neville and that was pretty mean, you know. I mean, yeah Neville might be reckless or that he often made mistakes, but seriously that was mean! he did not deserve it and I was so glad when Lupin defended him. This man was very amazing. so ... umm where do I find a guy like him in real life? he's such a sweet guy! OH! and one more thing, when Lupin was ill and he did not come to the class, but Snape came in the class instead ( I guess he was substituting this subject for a while because Lupin was ill) and he gave the students an assignment about werewolf so someone would realize his symptoms. UGH. SO WHAT IF HE'S A WEREWOLF? I mean, it would be okay if we put certain precautions. Basically, Lupin was just an amazing guy and I really like him. I am so sad that he resigned from teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. He's the best teacher for this subject!  \nProfessor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney\nOne of the best scenes in this book for me is when Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney bickered. It was too funny ahahahahaha. Thank God, I was at home when I read this scene. I would surely get funny looks, if I laughed in public place. \n\n\n'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal-gaze for him-''Imagine that,' said Professor McGonagall drily. \n\n\nHAHAHAHA I bursted out laughing when I read that part. That was just so funny.  \nHermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney\nLook, I really adore Hermione. She's smart, brave and such a devoted friend. She's honestly one of my inspirational characters that I adore very much. However, I did not like it when she was being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney. It is okay, if she did not like the study or believe the study or whatever it was. It is totally okay. I also have some subjects that I do not like to study, but I never disrespect any teachers. So It just slightly annoyed me when Hermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney \n\n\nHermione snorted.'Well, honestly ... \"the fates have informed her\" ... who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!' she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. \n\n\nIndeed, I can see her point. I understand her. But still, it is not okay to say something like that. She did not even keep her voice low! That's just not okay at all in my opinion. Overall, I loved this book very much. I had a great adventure with it and my days felt so magical when I spent them by reading it. Thank you very much for reading and liking this review. I really appreciate it. I hope you all have a great day! bye!\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n First Read Review\n 5 STARS\n\" Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. \"\nHarry Potter is a 13 year old boy now. He stays at his uncle's and aunt's house like he usually does for the whole summer. But this year is different, he can not control his anger anymore and he leaves his uncle's and aunt's house. There is also a man named Sirius Black, Mass-Murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort escaped from Azkaban. Most prisoners go mad withins weeks in Azkaban but this man doesn't and people say that he is coming after Harry and in Harry's first divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves and now, the school grounds are being Patrolled by DEMENTORS.My Opinion The cover of this book is so BEAUTIFUL! and the story was as amazing as the cover.I also found a new favorite character in this book and this person is Professor Lupin!! He is so cool and he is the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher I have ever met. because you know, all the Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers from the first book were not nice guys at all including that guy with useless ability. What's his name again?? LOCHART! GILDEROY LOCHART. I just remembered his name. Actually, where is he now? no one mentioned him and I hope I won't see him as a teacher in Hogwarts again. I still can't forgive him for what he was about to do with Ron and Harry in the second book. That guy is pathetic.I loved all the characters in this book and Fred and George weasley were so funny in this book. Percy is the last person I like. I don't hate him but I don't really like him too. He's so stritch about rules and sometimes he annoys me but not much. here is my favorite scene : 'How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?' asked Fred, as they tucked into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.'The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,' said Mr Weasley.  everyone looked up at him.'Why?' said Percy curiously.'it's because of you, Perce,' said George seriously. 'And there'll be little flags on the bonnets, with HB on them -''- for humungous Bighead,' said Fred. Everyone except Percy and Mrs Weasley snorted into their pudding. I laughed so hard in the middle of the night because of this. I wish I were there to see Percy's face when Fred and George said that. Oh! and I remembered I laughed so hard too when Ginny said he found out that Percy was kissing Penelope Clearwater, his girlfriend. I mean Percy is so stritch about rules and he always study, study, study, so the thought of Percy's having a girlfriend was never crossed my mind. But he was cool enough to get a girlfriend. *shrugs*I was so shocked when I found out that Sirius was innocent and the bad guy was Peter Pettigrew. how could he betray his own bestfriend?! I think he did it to save his own skin without thinking twice about his bestfriend's life. James and Lily Potter died because of him and how dare he to say that Sirius was the one who betrayed James Potter! this guy is more pathetic than Gilderoy and I was shocked when Harry told Lupin and Sirius not to kill him and put him in Azkaban instead. That moment I realised that Harry was so kind. this guy was the reason his parents died and he didn't want him to be killed. This book also have the best ending. the ending in this book made me grinning but don't get me wrong, the ending in the first and the second book were all great too but this ending was perfect. 'What's that?' he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. 'if it's another form for me to sign, you've got another -' 'it's not,' said Harry cheerfully. ' it's a letter from my godfather.' 'Godfather?' spluttered Uncle Vernon. 'you haven't got a godfather!.''Yes I hav,' said Harry brightly. 'He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check I'm happy...'And grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off towards the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last. Thank you guys for reading and liking my review.

Finn", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389527-the-woman-in-the-window", "reviews": ["\nWho knows what goes on in a family?\nOkay, I really don't want to misrepresent this book: The Woman in the Window is a pulpy, fast-paced popcorn thriller. It's not mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it is pageturning goodness. And it was exactly what I needed to get lost in right now.The premise is a little bit of The Girl on the Train and a little bit of The Woman in Cabin 10 (what is it with these girl/woman/wife titles?!), with an unreliable narrator, faulty memories, alcoholism, and the author playing around with our perception of what is true and what is imagined. My need to know what would happen kept me turning pages late into the night until I was physically incapable of keeping my eyes open a moment longer.The Woman in the Window treats a rather obvious plot element as a spoiler for most of the book, so I'll play coy too. It's about a woman called Anna who lives alone ever since separating from her husband and daughter. We're not told the circumstances of the separation, but we do know that Anna has a drinking problem and severe agoraphobia that prevents her from leaving the house.Housebound and drunk, Anna spends her days spying on her neighbours, until one day she witnesses something shocking in the window of the Russell's home. Everything begins to unravel when Anna attempts to report what she saw, and soon everything is being questioned: Did Anna hallucinate? Is it a combination of alcohol and pills? Can she even trust herself?The chapters are short and hard-hitting, making the fast-moving plot zip by even faster (\"This is the LAST chapter. Oh wait, the next is only two pages? Okay, this is the last chapter\"). I think the author does a great job of capturing both the fuzzy-headed confusion brought on by Anna's alcoholism and the suffocating claustrophobia of staying inside for almost a year. She makes for a pretty great unreliable narrator, and it is easy to feel her frustration when she can't even be sure herself if what she says is completely true.I also really liked how the author included Anna's passion for classic thriller movies. These offer interesting parallels with her reality and make you question whether something really did happen, or if Anna just saw it in a movie. Plus there's something a bit creepy about all these black and white flicks playing out in the background.The Woman in the Window is the kind of cozy psychological thriller that is easy to gobble up in a sitting or two. I didn't even mind that some things were obvious because the getting there was so damn fun and suspenseful. I'll be on the lookout for more from Finn.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "NO SPOILERSThis is a solid 4 Stars for me. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve read a psychological suspense thriller \u2014-a surprise gift in the mail. My copy says a film is already in the making. I can definitely see this novel as a movie. It should be good! The book is good. There are a few other reviews about the plot already ....so I\u2019m going to simply list some random thoughts about my experience reading it. ....I enjoyed the premises of this story. Anna Fox being a child psychologist with a psychological disorder herself was interesting: agoraphobia. ....I liked Anna ....I liked Anna as the narrator. She kept me reading through the dark hours of the night. .....Nothing was ever too chilling or too graphic. The one violent scene was pretty mild for a book like this.... which I appreciate.....I never thought Anna was looking out her window - with her camera in hand - just to be creepy. From the start - I suspected her looking out the window had another element- but nothing to do with the purpose of stalking, per say. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it was a \u2018feeling\u2019 I had....yet she did look through neighbors windows.....There was one surprise that was \u2018really\u2019 big for me \u2014 so much so -that I said to myself: \u201cHOT DAMN, how do you like those crackers\u201d? .....The title of this book is great - and not \u2018as\u2019 obvious as seems from the start. .....EACH of the characters are developed enough - just enough actually - they ride along with us ( the reader) as we are trying to figure what the heck happened:1. To Anna2. To a neighbor.....The 5 Story house that Anna lives in creates a great atmosphere.....Anna\u2019s pill poppin wine drinking throughout didn\u2019t alter my basic impression of Anna. I always felt that she was level-headed, and playing with a full deck - ( no matter how much drinking she did).....but was I wrong?Hmmmmm I\u2019m not sayin!For a psychological thriller......this was unputdownable for me.... but not in a nailbiting way. I didn\u2019t find it slow - or riveting....rather quietly gloriously-awesome.***note: This book sounds 'long' with almost 450 pages --but.....they are 'very' short chapters.Some pages only have a few words. Its a fast read!", "I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion but I'm getting a bit tired of reading mysteries where the main female character is an alcoholic. I get it, it makes them unreliable (and relatable for some maybe?) but it's a cheap way of doing it. With that said, I'm usually not too difficult with mysteries. They just have to not do anything stupid (racism, sexism...), be entertaining and have twists I don't see coming.In this book, you're following a psychologist who went through something traumatic that left her agoraphobe and... an alcoholic. Sadly I saw the twists coming and some parts towards the end just didn't feel right.However, I definitely felt like staying home and drinking... and I don't drink so I guess something in there worked... maybe?If you're looking for what others have described as a \"popcorn read\" then this might be it for you!", "\nI'm surprised that I actually finished this novel because my patience was gone, girl.\n", "5/5 Stars. I am SO BLOWN AWAY BY THIS NOVEL. The Woman In The Window is an absolutely amazing debut mystery-thriller. I cannot recommend it enough.CW: agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, substance abuse/alcoholism, murder, death, griefMy favorite part of this novel is the writing style. A.J. Finn has the perfect sort of prose that forces you to think, \u201cHow can someone ACTUALLY think like this? How does someone forms the words to illustrate such a perfect passage?\u201d This book is descriptive in a way I did not know ordinary things could be described. The writing is so beautiful. SO BEAUTIFUL. I am not the type of reader to get hung up on amazing vs. terrible writing, but I found myself pausing frequently while reading just to appreciate the sheer talent A.J. Finn possesses. I will literally read anything this man writes. Being honest, The Woman in the Window is a bit slow to start. I listened to the audiobook so I don\u2019t have an accurate understanding of the book page-number wise, but it took quite a few hours for the plot to really settle in. I feel the best way to describe the beginning of the book is \u201cmundane\u201d \u2013 It\u2019s normal, ordinary, typical. We follow Anna through her routine, isolated days for many chapters at the start of the story with few peaks in plot to keep the story exciting. That being said, I can\u2019t truthfully say it was boring. A.J. Finn\u2019s writing is so intoxicating that reading about Anna sitting at her computer was enjoyable. It is slow paced to start, but not at all dragging and still enjoyable.But of course, one of the absolute best aspects of the book is the immaculate plot. I love a thriller novel that has so many plot twists which all can convince me that the following twist is more believable than the last. Despite it\u2019s slow pace, I felt as if I was at the edge of my seat for the entirety of the novel. I\u2019m not the most prolific reader when it comes to thrillers, but The Woman In The Window is one of my favorites that I have ever read. This book was absolutely amazing. I want to recommend it to absolutely everyone. I\u2019m confident that A.J. Finn has become a new favorite author of mine and I\u2019m so excited for the film adaptation of this novel and his future works.", "3 STARSYou don't know how happy I was to get my greedy little paws on both the audio and Kindle versions of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. My expectations were through the roof! Have you seen all those 5 star reviews? As it turns out, the book doesn't live up to the hype. Yes, it is as addictive as popcorn, I couldn't put it down. But, there are so many disappointing drawbacks that I couldn't rate it a 4 star read.For audio-lovers, do not waste your precious Audible credit on this one. It is absolute trash. The actress portraying our boozy, traumatized victim/narrator is chirpy and confident sounding. Talk about a mindf*k! It does not work. In contrast, a similar book, The Girl on the Train is sheer perfection on audio. At about 40%, I turned off the audio, opened my Kindle and aaaaahhhh...the world made sense again. You know how much I love my unreliable narrators and our girl, Anna, is a doozy. Although she is terrified to step outside of her home, all kinds of interesting events still manage to take place in her small neighborhood. She spies on the nearby residents out of boredom. She's a regular Gladys Kravitz (you know, from Bewitched?). We can't trust Anna's narration because she is depressed and suffering from a traumatic event. And she pops a lot of pills and glugs wine as a chaser. Yeah, her take on the neighbors is suspect at best. All this is great. Absorbing. But, you know those people that use too many words and make simple matters overly boring? AJ Finn is one of those kind of writers. My patience runs thin with passages like this:Frigid air seizes my body, so raw that my heart feels faint; storms my clothes, sets them trembling around me. My ears brim with the sound of wind. I'm filling up with cold, running over with cold.Ugggghhhhh. I think she's cold. The book is so long and repetitive. It has an interesting, yet heavily borrowed upon plot and there are a couple of major twists. The plot twists are predictable, you will see them from a mile away, but it is still fun to see if your hunches were right (they will be). Just one more thing. Finn shoves a ton of film references into the storyline. At first, I loved it. Then, it becomes too much. It's as if he's saying, \"I'm not borrowing plot lines, I'm just referencing them.\" Wink-wink. It's all too heavy handed and cutesy, we know what's really going on. There is not a single original concept about this book. Ultimately, underwhelming.", "** Possible mild spoilers **Yet another super-hyped 'psychological thriller' which seems to think readers are innocents new to the genre... it's starting to feel like each new author just selects from a pack of established set pieces and gives them a bit of a shake hoping for something original. Here we have the traumatised, agoraphobic woman on a self-destructive binge of booze and pills keeping watch over her new neighbours and spotting a murder which the police claim never happened. Alongside that we have a menacing intruder in her house, online friends who may not be quite what they seem, a weird sexual encounter (what was that all about?), and the cliched climax where the insane psychopath confesses everything for no good reason other than to bring the book to an end. And how many times have we now seen the protagonist's traumatic secret used in other books? I'm afraid I spotted every twist and with so few characters it's not hard to guess the psychopath. It's a shame as Finn writes fluently, but, honestly, I was bored senseless with the agoraphobic narrator and her endless witterings about old films and how many bottles of wine she's drunk each day with her pills. If you read regularly in the genre, this is a hokey tale that you'll have seen before. I wish I'd resisted the hype. ", "4.5*\"Agoraphobia is an intense fear and anxiety of being in places where it is hard to escape, or where help might not be available. Agoraphobia usually involves fear of crowds, bridges, or of being outside alone.\" -NIHFor the past 10 months Anna has been trapped inside the four walls she calls home. She can\u2019t bring herself to take a single step outside. No grocery shopping, no walks through the park, not even to pick a package from the front stoop. Anna is an agoraphobic. Her days are filled with pills to control her anxiety and other ailments followed by a bottle or two (sometimes more) of wine to wash it all down. Her life outside her home is only viewed through her Nikon camera, where she watches her neighbors\u2019 daily routines. (Much to their chagrin).When she witnesses an attack in the home across the street no one will believe her. Not the home owners, not even the police!Anna begins to question if it\u2019s a side effect of her medication, or is there a reason no one wants to believe her.This book started out very slow for me. With most of us saying \u201chuh? I\u2019m confused!\u201d That confusion quickly cleared as the pace revved up. Soon I was in full speed thriller mode! What an incredible ride. A.J. Finn had me questioning everyone from Anna herself to a grandmother in Montana! Some of the twists were predictable - but that didn\u2019t take away from my enjoyment. The big finale of a twist was absolutely perfect! Didn\u2019t see that one coming at all! It\u2019s a fairly long book but reads super-fast and keeps you glued to the pages!

She's found ways around anything and everything that she needs - whether it be grocery delivery, hiring a handyman or cases of her favorite wine every few months. She will never need to leave her house and can get numb the pain as much as she wants.\n\u201cMy dear girl, you cannot keep bumping your head against reality and saying it is not there.\u201d\nShe spends her time observing the neighbors - keeping track of the gossip, watching the children get older, and more. \nWatching is like nature photography: You don\u2019t interfere with the wildlife.\nAnd then, the Russells move in across the way.A father, mother and teenage son. Anna is immediately struck by how perfect the family is. But then...the unthinkable happens.

To them, she's just a staggering drunk shut-in.But she knows what she saw. And she needs to get help - and fast - otherwise the next person could be her.Overall, objectively this one was fairly good. It started slow but picked up. The ending was simply un-put-downable. I quite enjoyed it.But I'm getting really tired of the unreliable narrator with a drinking problem. It's just something that I feel like I've read so many times (Girl on the Train, Woman in Cabin 10, etc). It made the book feel predictable, and even the big surprises felt like minor twists because I read the other two books (mentioned above).Ah well.

With audio, I\u2019m usually relaxing and don\u2019t want to stop to make a note.Anna Fox was once an active child psychologist with a wonderful life. But after a traumatic event almost a year ago, everything changed. She now suffers from agoraphobia. Her home is her entire world\u2026she no longer goes outside. Anna\u2019s life now consists of old movies, a lot of wine (and prescription pills), and online chat rooms. But she\u2019s also found another way to spend her time\u2026. watching the neighbors through her camera lens. She knows everyone\u2019s schedule; she even knows who is having an affair.Anna notices a new family has moved into the house across the street. They are the Russell\u2019s, a married couple with a teenage son. From everything Anna has seen they look like the perfect family. But of course, looks are often deceiving. One evening, as Anna is watching the Russell house she sees something she\u2019s was never meant to see, something horrible\u2026 and it sends her life into a tailspin.Did Anna really see what she thinks she did or is it possible she was wrong? Could she have hallucinated or had a bad dream? She doesn\u2019t know who she can trust. She\u2019s positive of what she saw but can she make others believe her? And if she\u2019s right\u2026could she be in danger too?To be honest, I had a hard time getting into the story at first. I wasn't connecting to the story and characters as well as many other readers did, which is fine as we won't all love the same books. I think I may have been expecting something different. I was a bit confused at times and although I eventually warmed up to the story and to Anna, it did take longer than I expected. I did enjoy the last part of the book so I am glad that I didn\u2019t stop reading.There were some very good twists, though I did figure out a few things ahead of time. I did like how everything came together in the end with a twist that I did not see coming.Overall I thought this was a decent psychological suspense novel and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what A.J.

Sometimes someone let them go. Sometimes they\u2019re in a group. In this case, there is a woman in a window. She\u2019s not a woman in white or a lady in shadows or a girl who circumnavigated anything. She\u2019s just a woman named Anna Fox in a window. And, like all of her friends from all those other books, she likes to drink a lot. And, just like her friends, maybe she\u2019s crazy! She is so unreliable! The drinking and the agoraphobia and all! Who can trust her? Oh boy oh boy this feels just everything else, doesn\u2019t it? This sounds like every other book you\u2019ve read in your life these days. A girl, a woman, some other pronoun like \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cI\u201d in the title. You\u2019ve been here before. You\u2019ve seen this trick too many times. Who is this A.J. Finn person and what makes them so special coming out here in 2018 with a title and a plot we have all seen dozens of times already? More importantly, how does this A.J. Finn person manage to breathe new life into something that I vehemently hate? I mean it is well documented all over Goodreads how I often find these books to be OK best, and that\u2019s rare. Now, here I am cranking this book on up to 4 stars like a total hypocrite. I get it. It\u2019s fine. This is a perfect summer read. I read it on a plane, but it would mix well with a beach or mountain. Whatever you wanna do. It is extremely fast paced, edge-of-your-dear kind of stuff. Very light and easy to breeze through. The plot twists and turns (although some of the big twists feel like something you already knew) are plentiful and press on to the very end. The ending tire everything up nicely, and while not too jaw dropping, it was satisfying. Finn also got me with the constant classic movie references and Hitchcock stuff. Anyone else feel like watching Rear Window or Vertigo now? I should go back and make a list of all the movies referenced in this thing. So yeah I enjoyed it. I felt like it was a cut above other psychological thrillers in this day and age. I went in not knowing much of the plot and with an open mind, and I am glad I took the time to knock this one out. Give it a whirl this summer while you\u2019ve got some time to just escape for a bit and sink into a good Hitchcockian tale about another woman in another window. Thank goodness she wasn\u2019t on a train this time.", "A.J. Finn respins a contemporary version of Rear Window set in Manhattan, New York. This dark psychological thriller has the pill taking, wine drinking, ex-child psychologist, Dr Anna Fox, residing in a three storey home that is the sum total of her world. Anna, you see, is an agoraphobic, and cannot step outside her home, she has lived like this for 10 months after a mystery trauma blew apart her world. She lost her marriage, her family and her career, although she does spend considerable time in communication with her ex-partner and her daughter, who is in his custody. Anna spends her days engaged in various activities, such as chess and learning French. She is a old black and white crime noir film aficionado, that includes watching Hitchcock movies with their motifs that spill over into Anna's actual life. Anna gets her dose of the outside world by people watching, observing the lives of her neighbours, like the Millers, through her window with her camera. A new family moves in directly opposite Anna, Alastair and Jane Russell with their son, Ethan. One day she observes a shocking event taking place in the Russells home. However, no-one believes her, including the police, and the Russells deny the allegations. Anna is your unreliable narrator, can she really be trusted? As Anna's paranoia levels reach sky high, she finds herself in increasing danger. She finds her past history colliding in her horrifying present. This is a story of twists, short chapters, and a narrative that proves to be fast paced, full of fear, tension and suspense. An engrossing and highly entertaining read that succeeded in holding my attention throughout. Many thanks to HarperCollins for an ARC.", "4.5 stars!! Okay, the hype this book is getting is warranted. I usually stink at guessing the outcome of a mysterious plot, the \u201cwho done it\u201d but I was spot on this time (yes!) and that still didn\u2019t deter me from loving this book. The ending? CRAZY!!! P.S. Loved all the movie references!!", "I'm really torn on this one, because on one hand I was able to see all the twists coming (see Karen Brissette's review for my similar feelings on this), and it was a long book to feel entirely predictable, but on the other it was still a fun, enjoyable novel and I whole heartedly embraced the inclusion of the black and white movies and Alfred Hitchcock favorites that I grew up on. I felt neutral on the narrator here; she wasn't a long term favorite but she didn't grate on my nerves either. Overall, I would count it a success and I'm floored that this was a debut novel.

It is while peering through one of these windows, that she believes she is witnessing a dangerous incident. An updated take on the movie, Rear Window, perhaps. But is she, and why will no one believe her?The suspense and the wanting to know is a prevalent factor here. One just keeps turning the pages, it was rather engrossing, but.....the execution could have been better. There were things that bothered me, didn't make sense within the context of the novels. Some large plot points that just withered away after being so prominent, leaving me unsatisfied. Disrupted the flow of the story, and made everything that happened unbelievable.

What is she to believe, her eyes or those who tell her what her eyes have or haven't seen? What, and who, is real? Does she have anyone or anything to fear?This is a taut thriller that definitely hooked me from the get-go. I had a lot of questions as I read, and wondered how Finn was going to bring everything together. While I felt like the book borrowed a lot from other thrillers and even some of the old movies Anna watched, the suspense definitely gets under your skin, and you absolutely want to fly through the book to see what the truth really is. Throughout most of the book, Anna feels like an old woman, but that's because of her condition. I had to keep reminding myself how old she really was.I felt like the whole story took a little too much time to play out\u2014there were only so many times I could handle Anna's drunken binges, her not being believed by those she trusted, and her intense paranoia, which pushed everyone away. But there are some great twists here, some I didn't quite see coming and one I suspected (which disappointed me), and much like many thrillers and crime novels, the perpetrator spends far too much time explaining themselves and their motivations.I read a lot of thrillers so I tend to be really cynical about them. This is a good one, and I'd imagine this one is going to have many people eagerly turning the pages and staying up late because they can't get enough!

AJ Finn's debut novel is placed in current day, gentrified Harlem, New York City, where Dr. Anna Fox spends her day in her five-story townhouse drinking Merlot, spying on her neighbors, and mixing pills to numb her thoughts. She has theories and pseudo-storylines for her neighbors, each one being unique and different in their own way. When she is not photographing and spying on her neighbors, Anna watches famous black and white movies to pass the time and regularly checks in with her daughter and husband, who she recently has separated from. Anna suffers from agoraphobia, preventing her from leaving the confines of her house and limiting her ability to experience the real world effectively. Her hours, days, and weeks are consumed by fear and curiosity. When her new neighbors move in across the park from her house, Anna is intrigued at their anonymity. As she begins to investigate the story of her new neighbors, something horribly goes wrong. Anna witnesses something that shouldn't have happened\u2014or did she?I won this ARC in a Goodreads giveaway and literally jumped out of my bed and yelled, \"YESSS!!!\" I immediately was drawn to the story because let's face it, spending time spying on your neighbors while drinking too much wine sounds like my Friday nights. I was curious to see how this story would develop and see what the hype was about. After getting hooked in right from the beginning, I figured out why. \nThe Woman in the Window\n will definitely not be for everybody. The initial pacing is moderate, to say the least. I wouldn't classify it as a slow burn however, because as the story progresses, the character development of Anna and the provided characters becomes ever more intriguing. Nothing is rushed or overlooked\u2014everything is portrayed at exactly the right time. Why is Anna agoraphobic? What's her mental state like? How is she coping? What's going on in the outside world that she's missing? Who are all these people around her? These are just some of the questions that pulled me in while starting \nThe Woman in the Window\n and it kept me guessing until the end. \nThe Woman in the Window\n breaks away from the mold of some of the more recent in-your-face psychological thrillers that have been sprouting out more and more since the release of the book that shall not be named, and that's very refreshing to me. This type of psychological thriller really gets you in the mindset of Anna's psyche without throwing everything at you at once. As I've stated earlier, this book will not be for everyone. This thriller breaks the mold and sets a new standard\u2014so buckle up 2018! Thank you Goodreads and William Murrow Books for my advanced copy.", "\"I am locked in.

But I must honestly say that the pacing is all wrong. The beginning chapters are slow. We, the readers, circle around the storyline puffing up cushions trying to get comfy and ready. It's gonna take a while. Prepare for that. But then, it finally takes off. My other concern is the amount of pills and Merlot that Anna consumes on a daily basis. In the real world, she'd be face down, not breathing, and with carpet marks all over her face. I'll leave it there and hope the screen writers will nip and tuck.I encourage you to take this one out for a test drive. Cushions propped up, you might just be in for a surprise. And no Merlot required.....", "This review is a hard one for me. I struggled with the first half of the book, only to be totally drawn in by the end. The book starts offs slowly, setting the stage. Anna Fox is a child psychotherapist who suffers from agoraphobia. As she\u2019s trapped in her house, there\u2019s not a lot of action to begin with. But that kind of works. But a little of that goes along way and I kept waiting for something to happen to turn up the pace. I definitely didn\u2019t relate to Anna, but I also had a hard time finding her believable. The idea that she\u2019d be able to consume multiple bottles of wine at one time, on top of prescription drugs and be able to speak or walk at all seemed unbelievable. I\u2019d be comatose, not just slurring my words. However, I didn\u2019t think of her as a stalker or a voyeur, I didn\u2019t find her creepy that way. As the story goes along, I started wondering about some of the twists I assumed were coming. I correctly guessed the first big reveal well before it comes out. This book is a homage to old movies, especially Hitchcock and other film noir directors. But the movie this most reminded me of is a more recent one. I can\u2019t name it without giving out a spoiler, which I refuse to do in a review. Flip side, I totally blew how I envisioned the ending. Grading this is hard. The second half of the book is much more engrossing than the first. It really took a long time to grab me. The first half of the book is barely a three, the second half is somewhere between four and 4 \u00bd stars. I listened to this and the narrator, Ann Marie Lee, did a great job. Her voice was a rainbow of nuances and emotions. But I\u2019m wondering if this would have worked better as a book than as an audiobook. I find I like my audiobooks to be fast paced. I heard glimpses of good phrasing, something I always appreciate when I\u2019m reading. Unfortunately, good writing is harder for me to appreciate when listening rather than reading. But that\u2019s me, I\u2019m definitely more visual than aural. So, in the end I'm going with a 3.5 stars.

This book has restored my faith in psychological thrillers and was a solid 5 star reading experience. It\u2019s well-written, perfectly plotted, and riveting. I had trouble putting it down and became annoyed when life interrupted my reading \u2013 it didn't feel like >400 pages and I could have happily read it cover to cover in one sitting. Anna is a 38 year-old child psychologist with agoraphobia, who hasn\u2019t left her home for over a year. Her husband left her some time ago, and took their 8 year old daughter with him, but Anna talks to them nightly. She spends the rest of her days and nights watching old black-and-white movies on TV, chatting and dispensing advice in an online forum, and spying on her neighbors, all while downing large amounts of Merlot with a concoction of prescription pills.  I loved the psychological aspect of the novel and being privy to Anna\u2019s thoughts and actions as she struggled with depression and agoraphobia. I had enormous sympathy for her. One day, while spying on the neighbors across the street, Anna witnesses a crime, but, because of her alcohol and pill addiction, she has trouble getting the police to believe her \u2013 that and the fact that there is zero evidence of a crime, but compelling evidence that Anna is unstable and imagining things. In fact, Anna begins to doubt herself.  One of my favorite parts of the story was Anna\u2019s love for old black and white classic movies, such as Rear Window, Gaslight, and Stranger on a Train, etc. Did Anna really see what she claimed happened, or is she blurring the lines between reality and what she was watching on her tv screen every night? The author does a marvelous job keeping the reader guessing. And this reader had an urge to pour a glass of Merlot and watch a Hitchcock movie ;-) There are twists along the way, all revealed at just the right time. I appreciated that the author didn\u2019t insult the reader's intelligence by using one particular revelation (that I had already figured out) as a 'shocking twist'. I thought it was brilliant to plant the necessary clues along the way but not until the end do we see how they all fit together. And what a surprising ending it was! This is an amazing debut, and I\u2019m not surprised that the movie rights have already been sold, as well as foreign publication rights. It deserves all the accolades it's receiving.

While in this case the word is \"Woman\", the trendy use of \"Woman\" in titles lately is just about as bad as \"Girl\", so it might as well be the same thing. Also, I have no control of when my library holds come in, so here I am reading a book with \"Woman\" in the title.It is about what you would expect from the Girl/Woman genre. A topsy-turvy mystery with lots of twists and lots (and I mean LOTS) of alcohol. This mystery is an homage to the Hitchcock classic, Rear Window, as well as other noir thrillers from that time period. And, despite being a homage, it did feel like a fresh take in the Girl/Woman genre.The writing was good and kept me interested throughout. I was engaged in trying to figure out what the heck was going on. The main character was consistently very intense and hysterical - and she kind of had a right to be. But, it kept reminding me of this classic scene from the movie Airplane because I wanted to reach into the book, grab her shoulders, and shake her yelling, \"CALM DOWN!\"I did enjoy this better than some of the other books in this genre. It may not have blown me away, but it definitely didn't feel like it was leaning too hard on overdone tropes.

The story tself dragged on and on, and I actually could put this book down. In fact, I had to return it to the library, and I didn't miss it, which told me a lot about how I felt about it.

Anna is so determined to find out what she saw in the window.... and exactly what did she find?!! So.... bottom line I was really not that impressed with this one. I have seen raving reviews for it but here are some of the issues I had with this one:1) Black and white video obsession (this absolutely drove me insane and honestly this just made it so confusing for me to have random quotes from the movies that the author put in the novel)....... lost me completely2) Anna was getting on my nerves with her paranoia.. which I felt the story dragged on..... just get to the conclusion already.3) There were some surprises at the end but overall it was lacking BIG time for me.

Anna is a house-bound psychologist that spends her days drinking wine, popping benzos, watching films, and spying on her neighbors with the powerful zoom of her camera. One day, Anna is doing her usual snooping when she sees a crime being committed and her life is then turned upside down. This is the setup for this thriller and is all I'm saying about this novel, you must read it to find out what happens. I enjoyed the novel and experienced many thoughts and emotions while reading it. At the beginning I thought 'I'd love to spend my days like Anna relaxing at home' UNTIL the main character described the crippling aspect of agoraphobia and how the mental illness has limited her life and the lives of other sufferers like her. The author did a great job of chronicling the symptoms and thoughts of the main character, Anna's anxiety and powerlessness. It is extremely difficult to cope with a mental illness, however, the main character annoyed me at points because she did not help herself by constantly missing her doses, erroneously taking double doses, and mixing them with alcohol despite her Doctor's stern warning to NOT mix her prescribed medications with alcohol. However... if we didn't have conflict we wouldn't have a novel, right? Overall, I enjoyed the novel and recommend it to readers of thrillers and contemporary fiction.

Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.

This was WAY better than I remember it being, and I remember it being pretty darn good. J.K. Rowling is a writing goddess and I can't believe how much foresight and planning went into this series. She already hints at the horcruxes and many other things in this book that don't show up until much later. Definitely one of my favorites in the series (but I say that about all of them)!\n", "\nUm. Wow. Yeah. That was freaking FANTASTIC!!!! Probably my favorite so far, just wow oh my gosh......WHAT EVEN!!

Deep and layered, it goes down smooth, never seeming overly complex.\n", "\n*To read more reviews by me visit Views & Reviews *I seriously have no idea why I still review these books when I have nothing new to say. I mean... J.K. Rowling is perfect. This series is perfect. And I dream day & night of going to Hogwarts. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to show you how I felt about this book:When I started the book:During the book:At the end: Umm.. Mam Rowling..All in allSorry for the lame review, readers. I just really don't know what to say..\n", "\nThere is an incredibly somber mood that descends on me every time I finish this book in the series, and reading it with the illustrations did nothing to change that. I felt the drawings were impeccable, and I loved how some of the characters were reimagined to look a different way than portrayed in the movies, my favorite being Mad Eye Moody. Now, the long wait for the remainder of the illustrated editions. :(\n", "This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called \"experts\" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don\u2019t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn\u2019t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already \"been there done that\" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn\u2019t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling\u2019s breezy, \u201cear friendly\u201d prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It\u2019s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

ROWLING FORESHADOWS EVERYTHINGGGG-when the Weasley men come to Privet Drive through the Dursleys' fireplace is just.... priceless. Yet ANOTHER scene that I wish had made it into the movie.-We get to meet Bill in this book (way earlier than in the movies, I might add), and Mrs. Weasley is very disapproving of how Bill looks. I love that Bill stood up for himself and was like NOBODY GIVE AN F HOW I LOOK, AND NEITHER DO IIIIII. It was a nice thing to throw in there.-Dobby is also in this book more, and seeing how different he is was really fun.-Harry and Ron fighting made my heart hurt so much.-All of the drama at the Yule Ball just made me SQUEEE because it's so obvious that Ron and Hermione like each other and they just don't want to admit it and GAH. THE FEELS.-I also love how much Hermione stands up for what she believes in, which you can particularly see in this book. She wants justice for the house-elves, she won't let Ron get away with being an idiot (like when he says he just wants a pretty girl to go to the ball with), and she is especially confident in this book as well. Malfoy and many other people are constantly teasing her, but she is completely above it, and for that I admire her.-WHEN HARRY IS LISTENING TO HAGRID AND MADAME MAXIME AND HE SEES THE BEETLE? IMAGINE IF HE HAD JUST STEPPED ON IT? WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN GREAT?-I completely forgot about the part where Harry sees Barty Crouch on the Marauders Map! He was so close to finding out something big, but then things got crazy and he didn't, but WHOA. SO CLOSE. -Cedric's death hit me a lot harder than it ever has before... He was such an amazing person, and I wish that he could have survived so him and Harry could have been buddies.-VOLDEMORT FORESHADOWS HORCRUXES IN THIS BOOK.

Here are some of my favourites:1. S.P.E.W.2. Hermione in every scene ever3. The house elves and the kitchen scenes (I'm honestly so in love with the kitchens. Every time they tickle the pear in the portrait I get all excited)4. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons5. The Yule Ball and the fact that Harry thinks Hermione is a girl he's never seen before6. The fact that Ron has a huge crush on Krum while Hermione stays utterly unimpressed and as soon as Krum takes her to the ball the situation changes, Hermione likes Krum and Ron rips him (well, miniature him) apart7. Harry's fight with Ron. Not because I enjoy them fighting but because Jo perfectly captures the feeling of anger and frustration that I have everytime I'm in a similiar situation.8. The Wonky Feint. I'm still laughing.9. Rita Skeeter's reports. I love to hate her.10. Severus Snape cold bloodedly claiming he can't see a difference when Hermione's teeth are half a metre longer than usual. This incredible man.11. Molly Weasley being such a good mom to Harry. Got tears in my eyes just thinking about it.12. Hermione's triumph over a vicious beetle.Still, the book is not my favourite in the series, the reason being the horrible graveyard scene in the end.

GOBLET OF FIRE is definitely work and I could've done for a lot of cutting. One of the things I admire most about this series is the way J.K. Rowling can speed through a year in under 300 pages. And GOBLET is twice that length and it didn't always feel justified. I shouldn't complain because more time in this world is MORE TIME IN THIS WORLD, and it's all very realized, but the pacing still felt off. (I really, really could've done without the Quidditch World Cup.) When I first read this novel when I was 13 going on 14, I took a break for MONTHS. And the same thing happened during this reread as a 28-year-old. I think it was around the same part too. But once you get to the Third Task, it all picks up. This last fourth of the novel has always been my favorite. Voldemort's return! That scene with the Death Eaters! Harry vs. Voldemort! Moody isn't Moody! Rita Skeeter exposed! It's all wonderful. GOBLET isn't my favorite in the series, but it's still pretty damn magical. ", "\nBest one so far! \"Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to the boy who was good, was kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\" \n", "4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this.  I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and (view spoiler)[Cedric Diggory's death.  (hide spoiler)]The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner.", "I remember the first time I read this\u2026\u2026I\u2019d just started a real crappy job that I came to hate. I\u2019d dropped out of university after my first year because my degree in psychology was a terrible choice, I seemed to be making more enemies than friends through life, but none of that mattered because I was reading a great series of books. I had something to look forward to every day when I really needed it. The point is books are escapism and fantasy books particularly so. As I got my shit together, this book helped me move on and get through life as so many other books have since. As Harry, Ron and Hermione entered their fourth year of Hogwarts, arguably their most challenging and intense year yet, I checked my mail box to see if my invite had finally arrived. It hadn\u2019t. It still hasn't.Maybe one day.

HP4 was actually so satisfying (after a little waiting for it) & it became instantly my favourite when I finished it.I also was amused by the new information about this world & wizardry education. I gasped at the moment which I believe was the big Turning point of this book associated with the title. I was shocked & also glad of how it ended. I was looking forward to it to happen in the story. I wanted to see how the world would be after that, that hair-raising thrilling horror in last few chapters, because the world was going to change. {the biggest Turning Point of the entire HP series!}(yeah I have some weird fangirling features & one of them is remembering my first reaction when I enter a fandom, or in this case first time reading my fav books in the series.

It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament, a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. \u201cIf you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\u201dThe introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. \u201cIt matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.\u201dOur trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls \ud83d\ude02. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet.

I was unfamiliar with Jim Kay's artwork but pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the illustrations were. I have reread this series many, many times and watched the movies repeatedly as well. So I cannot help but picture the characters as the actors of the movie. And certain scenes play out in my head exactly how they were depicted in the movies. Jim Kay's artwork threw all that out of my mind. I saw Hogwarts in a new light, I saw these characters in the way they were originally described in the books. The illustrated editions are not just for kids. Infact some of the pictures were so terrifying I thought it might give me nightmares (I might or might not be referring to giant spiders *shivvers*).Kay's work really enhanced my reading experience and I am so excited to start collecting all of these books! \u00ab Thank you to Bloomsbury and JB publishers for gifting me a copy for review \u00bb______Buddy reading with Snape's brother  ______My reviews for:1:  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone2:  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "Like I have already mentioned in my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it is definitely noticeable that Rowling's writing style has improved massively compared to the first two books in the series. The amount of suspense and foreshadowing was incorporated very well and made the reading experience so much fun. I found myself constantly holding my breath towards the end, there were so many twists and turns! I have actually seen the movie version before, but I forgot much of it, so I was extremely surprised at some of the reveals. The build up towards those situations was just perfect!I loved that we got to see a bit more interaction between muggles and wizards in the beginning, as well as more scenes outside of Hogwarts. It was a nice change and helped bring a bit more realism to the story (it was nice to see that wizards and witches get excited over such a normal thing as a sport event, too!).One of my favorite things in the book was the portrayal of friendship. Harry, Ron and Hermione were depicted as normal teenagers, who sometimes just happen to fight over the stupidest little things. I feel like that really brought their friendship forward, in a way. I, in general, feel like there was a lot of progress and development in the book. I haven't read the following books yet, so I obviously can't say how much of what happened in this one will play a part later, but I still feel like I learned so many new things about the world this story takes place in and about the characters in it. And oh man, how much I just love those characters...", "Reread in December 2017 for #HarryXmasToYouForever sad about Winky not being in the movie and Rita Skeeter\u2019s whole story not making it in either, because she\u2019s so awful but JUSTICE IS SERVEDReread in December 2015 for #HarryXmasToYouSeriously so many things I forgot because it's so different from book to movie!

There is too much tournamenting for my taste. 2. I hate the house elves. :O3. The word \"quietly\" is egregiously overused. It loses its effectiveness because it appears so often.4. There are moments when Harry and Ron behave like stereotypical stupid boys (I know, I know, they're 14...doesn't mean I can't be annoyed with them.)The book gets an extra star because the last 10 chapters were very good, though, and I loved:1. that Hermione gets a makeover, but then matter-of-factly says it's too much trouble to straighten her hair every day.2. the creepy thing in the blanket 3.

A few of the many things the movie got wrong or missed to include: 1. Winky & Dobby & Mr. Bagman.2. Went on ruining the mystery of the story right from the beginning. Ugh!3. Rita Skeeter\u2019s most well deserved punishment.^^ All thanks to Hermione.^^4. Wormtail being all smug.5. Hermione\u2019s ball dress should have been periwinkle blue! P.S. Harry's first attempt at romance happened here so it makes perfect sense that I'm posting this review on Love Day. What's more perfect is I get to greet my smart and sexy French Friend, Anna a HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I hope you're having the best day, my awesome friend! I was going to read something else for you but I can't keep my hands off Harry Potter. I am positively hexed. Lol. ", "Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend\u2019s Ron\u2019s house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore\u2019s age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore\u2019s advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George\u2019s determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine\u2019s growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort\u2019s supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville\u2019s family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn\u2019t resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry\u2019s godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius\u2019 presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry\u2019s journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry\u2019s world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars "], "genre": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/3046572-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire", "avg_ratings": "4.56", "ShelvedNumber": "2309"}

He is a young executive and she is artist on the brink of an exciting career. They are settling into the routine of their life together, when they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years for a crime Celestial knows he didn\u2019t commit. Though fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding. As Roy\u2019s time in prison passes, she is unable to hold on to the love that has been her center. After five years, Roy\u2019s conviction is suddenly overturned, and he returns to Atlanta ready to resume their life together.This stirring love story is a deeply insightful look into the hearts and minds of three people who are at once bound and separated by forces beyond their control. An American Marriage is a masterpiece of storytelling, an intimate look into the souls of people who must reckon with the past while moving forward- with hope and pain- into the future.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491493625l/33590210.jpg", "title": "An American Marriage", "authors": "Tayari Jones", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage", "reviews": ["\nMuch of life is timing and circumstance, I see that now.\nI know it's still early, but I've got a feeling this is going to be one of my favourite reads of 2018. It is a powerful, subtle, sad tale about the criminal justice system in America, and the personal, long-term consequences of its injustices.There's a lot of discussion, articles and fiction looking at race-based injustice in the prison system of the United States. Most of these focus on racial-profiling of young black men, and how juries are more likely to convict a black man than a white man when presented with the same evidence. An American Marriage, though, does something a bit different. While race - specifically, being a black American - is one of the major pillars of the novel, it is not so much the focus as the stage on which this tale of love, marriage and loyalty plays out. Instead of looking at the injustice itself, the novel turns to the far-reaching consequences of it - how lives are turned upside down and relationships fall apart as a result. It is driven by complex and fascinating character drama, moving between the perspectives of the entirely non-white cast to create a character portrait that is both broad and deep.Roy is a hard-working, entrepreneurial black man who has clawed his way out of a working-class background, earned a scholarship to college, and married a middle-class artist, Celestial. Next step: starting a family together. Then, during a trip back home to Louisiana, Roy is accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit.As the first person narrative gives way to an epistolary format during Roy's time in prison, we see how Roy's incarceration drives a wedge between him and Celestial. An American Marriage asks us to consider what it really means to be married, and whether there comes a point when loyalty can no longer be expected. We are ultimately reminded that injustices against innocent black men are injustices against many others - the wives or husbands, the mothers and fathers, and the friends who love them. Jones sheds a haunting light on the all-encompassing nature of racial injustice. It is extremely effective.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "2.5 starsI know this book is getting a lot of buzz and it was Oprah's Book Club pick so I had really high hopes but it didn't really work for me. I started to give it 3 stars but after thinking more on it I just couldn't. For me, a 3-star rating means that overall I enjoyed the book. However, this book just didn't rise to that level. I'll start with what I did like. I liked how the author weaved in the complexities of being a successful black American. Roy was a rising business executive but because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and fit a certain description his life/marriage was upended. The first part of the book is in epistolary form where we see the letter exchanges between Celestial and Roy while he was prison. In those letters you can see the slow changes in their relationship as time went on. This is basically the only part of the book where I felt any semblance of a connection to the story. Now for what I didn't like ... the characters. I didn't connect to Roy or Celestial so I didn't feel invested in their story. Also, I understand that life and marriages can be messy and that some decisions we make aren't always cut and dry. But some of the decisions that Celestial and Roy were making were nonsensical to me and not fully explained. Particularly in Celestial's case toward the end of the book. I didn't understand her. Maybe I'm missing something. Overall, I didn't have a strong emotional connection to the story. I'm sure many people will love this book but it wasn't for me. ", "\nI can\u2019t say that I loved An American Marriage. What I can say, is that it made me think deeply about human nature, love, and, of course, marriage. This is a thought-provoking, well-written, depth-filled character study about a marriage on the brink. \nCelestial and Roy, a young couple from Atlanta, have been married for just over a year when Roy is arrested and sentenced to 12 years in jail. Will their marriage survive their separation or will they be able to withstand Roy\u2019s incarceration? The bulk of the story focuses on a love triangle between Roy, Celestial, and Celestial\u2019s childhood friend, Andre. In addition to romantic love and marriage, themes of motherhood and fatherhood, race, class, and tradition also play prominent roles. Told in alternating point of views, as well as through letters, the devolution of Roy and Celestial\u2019s marriage is revealed through their letters. Some of the events are hard to read, and at times, made me a little uncomfortable. This is not a pretty read, nor is it one that is filled with action. What it does have are three very real, well-drawn out characters who are struggling with both the choices that they have made and not being able to change what they cannot control. I felt their pain, their emotions permeate the pages, and even though I didn\u2019t always agree with them, I understood their choice(s). The ending felt authentic and while some might not like the way how things play out, I was satisfied. This is a credit to Jones who paints an honest picture of the characters and events that occur.", "A couple years ago, Melinda and I visited a state prison in Georgia as part of our foundation\u2019s work on U.S. poverty. I\u2019d never been to a prison before, and it was an eye-opening experience.The most memorable part was the discussion we had with some of the inmates about transitioning back into society. Although most were looking forward to leaving prison behind, some were clearly anxious about it. One man told us he was scared to re-enter society after so many years behind bars. Another mentioned that it felt like he was a car about to be dropped into the middle of a racetrack where the other cars are already going 200 miles per hour.I couldn\u2019t help but think about that conversation when I was reading An American Marriage by Tayari Jones. Although it\u2019s fictional, the story is about the question at the heart of the anxiety Melinda and I saw that day: how do you rebuild your life after prison?Our daughter Jenn recommended that we read this deeply moving story about how one incident of injustice reshapes the lives of a black couple in the South and eventually dooms their relationship. Roy and Celestial are newlyweds living in Atlanta. They seemed to have it all: good careers, a decent house, and a lot of love for one another (although their marriage wasn\u2019t perfect).That all changes when Roy gets falsely accused of rape and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Despite how radically this event changes their lives, Jones doesn\u2019t spend much time on it. She devotes only five pages to Roy\u2019s arrest and trial. Her message is clear: Roy is innocent, Celestial knows it, and neither fact matters. He\u2019s caught up in the system regardless.What Jones is more interested in is how incarceration changes relationships. About half of the book is letters exchanged between Roy and Celestial while he\u2019s locked up. Although they start out sweetly, the letters become more tense as time goes on. Eventually, Celestial stops writing to Roy altogether. By the time he gets released from prison seven years early, she\u2019s moved on. (I promise this isn\u2019t a spoiler. It\u2019s in the book\u2019s jacket description!)There\u2019s this mythical notion that you\u2019ll wait forever for the person you love. Penelope from the Odyssey is the classic example\u2014she fights off potential suitors for 20 years waiting for her husband, Odysseus, to return from war.It\u2019s a romantic idea, but is it realistic? Jones doesn\u2019t seem to think so. We all like to imagine we\u2019d be Penelope in that situation, but I suspect many would end up like Celestial instead. She writes to Roy, \u201cYou may feel like you\u2019re carrying a burden, but I shoulder a load as well.\u201d Later, she says, \u201cA marriage is more than your heart, it\u2019s your life. And we are not sharing ours.\u201dThe fact that their marriage didn\u2019t have a fairytale ending felt realistic. Roy\u2019s unjust incarceration\u2014and the separation it caused\u2014pushed on the seams that already existed in their relationship, and eventually those seams broke. Despite her decision to leave him, Celestial is a sympathetic character. You understand why she made her choice.An American Marriage is fundamentally a story about how incarceration hurts more than just the person locked up. It\u2019s also a reminder of how draconian our criminal justice system can be\u2014especially for black men like Roy. Once you get sucked into that system, you\u2019re marked for life. Everything you were or had can disappear while you\u2019re in prison.In a letter to his lawyer, Roy writes about how things have been difficult for Celestial but even more difficult for him. \u201cI try to see her side of things, but it\u2019s hard to weep for anyone who is out in the world living their dream,\u201d he says.Jones is such a good writer that you can\u2019t help but empathize with Roy and Celestial. Both have been put into a super-difficult position. I obviously haven\u2019t experienced what they go through, but the characters\u2014and their reactions to the situation\u2014ring true to me.I wouldn\u2019t say An American Marriage is a light, easy read, but it\u2019s so well-written that you\u2019ll find yourself sucked into it despite the heavy subject matter. If you\u2019re looking for something thought-provoking to read this winter, you should add this one to your list.", "This book stung so hard I almost looked for the cut of it on my skin. It\u2019s the kind of novel that sinks its teeth into you. One that enkindles in you such a brief and yet so excruciating pain. One that is so vivid the first glimpse of reality would shock you, and you would emerge from its thrall dazed, half dreaming, dizzy, and for a moment, aching, blinking, parched, unreal, everything else\u2026fades away. One that changes you, leaves you a little different by the time you are done. But above all, one that reminds you that humans really are so often this way\u2014inexplicable, restless, unyielding, and unfathomable.It\u2019s stories like these that I most relish\u2014the ones that disquiet you and fill your dreams and fit awkwardly at best into your ordered mind. These are the ones that haunt you and become part of your personal canon. These are the ones you won\u2019t forget.In sharp, vivid language that dwells on ugliness and beauty in equal measure, Jones explores, with soul-baring poignancy, the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple in a haunting, compelling and deeply humane work of fiction. There are few novels so willing to give up their souls, but Jones\u2019 sincerity sprinkles the text like sequins and her words are the skip of a stone across a lake, forming ripples and ripples of emotion.Being the victim of a wrongful conviction is one of those impossible things that happen in places so impossibly far away from where we are that they might as will not exist. But to Roy and Celestial, it came crashing down, as real as a reflection in the mirror.Roy and Celestial's life stretched out indescribably precious and sweet before them, with the years laid out ahead and the choices still there to be made: him as a rising corporate executive, and her building a portfolio as an artist. But Roy\u2019s wrongful imprisonment was the rupture of the small, brave hope growing inside their marriage.Much of the story is told through the letters Roy and Celestial send each other during his incarceration. We witness as the fine grains of their relationship begin to course between their fingers. We watch as they try to cling on to a kernel of hope. But the years have stretched Celestial thin, leaving her waiting, trapped and trembling on the borders of her own life, and Roy\u2019s life was getting white around the edges and sometimes, it seemed that he had no past, no memories, that he had been, for too long, on this stretch of tenebrous, hissing road. Neither could guess at the shape of an as-yet-uncharted future looming out of the fog. This was loss, of the ugliest stripe, and they saw no end to it, only the far horizon, stretching on and on.When Roy wins his release, it was all he had wanted to hear for five years. But freedom had never tasted so much like ashes. While Roy was despeteraly clinging to the hopeless longing for lost happiness, Celestial has begun forging a new life with her childhood best friend, Andre. Something has been lost in the long gulf of Roy and Celestial\u2019s separation, and they don\u2019t know whether they want it back or not.\u201cAn American Marriage\u201d is a viscerally potent exploration of a difficult marriage that has tension and fraction stemming from good people trying their best, growing and changing and learning, and just as often, failing and screwing up or making the wrong choices. Two people, both crumpled and cast-aside, exhausted from their own efforts to become something more than a consequence, and who will always be married where it counted\u2014in the horrors they had shared.Jones lures you into Roy and Celestial\u2019s lives only to do terrible, wonderful things to your head and heart. Reading this book, I was struck sometimes by the senseless idea that everything around me was made of glass. I was afraid to breathe, afraid to move. Dread lanced every moment, and my head was a spinning top of new and uncertain possibilities. I felt my heart limping in my chest as Celestial and Roy walked the floor of their relationship like tightrope performers, placing each foot gingerly in front of the other, testing for weaknesses, waiting for the moment when the whole thing eventually gives way.It would\u2019ve been so easy to call sides\u2014choose a character and place the weight of the blame on their shoulders. But Jones forces the reader to relentlessly ponder what Celestial and Roy really owe each other, as \u201cAn American Marriage\u201d corkscrews into a tighter and tighter coil. With every page, we see various elements of the characters\u2019 personalities which hitherto we had only glimpsed, but which had orchestrated and magnified themselves to a startling level of potency. Roy and Celestial\u2014and even Andre\u2014had made so many mistakes that they could not find their way back through their tangle to the first one. Roy had no words in their common language to explain that he is punctured and torn and needed someone to suture him back together, nor did Celestial, who felt herself wither a bit more inside way down deep where the light never reaches, and that might just be the final nail in the coffin they\u2019ve been building between them.I felt torn in some way, grappled with the implications of the decisions the characters made. I wanted to step outside their heads and hope I would see from some new vantage something simple and understandable. But nothing about this story is supposed to be so stark, or so simple.A tight ache closed around my heart for Roy who\u2019s been robbed of something he could never get back. Roy created a door between him and Celestial and he believed he could come back and knock and count on it being opened, and I couldn\u2019t fault him for letting his mind lie to him because his world was more comfortable that way, because it hung together better that way. But I couldn\u2019t fault Celestial for anything either. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to resent the \u201cus\u201d that glimmered between her and Andre. Time is a funny thing\u2014it doesn\u2019t forgive the things that are beyond our control. And life is a river that cannot be called back once it leaves its banks. What had been taken from Celestial could never amount to what had been taken from Roy, but is it selfishness to refuse to wait in an agony of wondering? Or is it selfishness to expect one to wait in the first place?Ultimately, this is what holds steady throughout the novel: Jones gives us a truth that is messy and nuanced, complex, and sometimes contradictory, and yields no easy answers.At its core, \u201cAn American Marriage\u201d is a love story, but reading this book, it's hard to escape its condemnation of a deeply flawed system of justice. \"What happened to me could happen to anybody,\" Roy tells Andre who shoots back, \"You think I don't know that? I been black all my life.\" Roy might have survived a mordant injustice, but the shadow fell very dark on him. When justice was eventually served, it was a kind of escape, but it mocked freedom. It was not going to bring back Roy\u2019s lost years. It was not going to change the past. But it will forever define it. Jones tells you that maybe it doesn\u2019t have to define the future too. Roy's present might be overlaid with past sorrow, but he was free, and in the end, in that moment, that place, that perch upon the edge of the world, his view went on forever.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. BLOG | TWITTER | INSTAGRAM | TUMBLR", "Update: 2018 National Book Awards: Fiction Another great choice pick this year!!!SMALL UPDATE: I said I would come back and write a more complete review... but a few comments in here have inspired and encouraged me ... to perhaps leave this review alone. So.., I\u2019ll only add a couple of things. Sharing First: it\u2019s funny - what happens to our minds when we move on right away to reading other books after a deep thought- provoking read...It\u2019s like ADDING more children to the family - expanding our heart to love and think about each one - differently- but each so special. Recently it\u2019s been like a grand slam rocking hot reading explosion experience.It started with \u201cThe Weight of Ink\u201d by Rachel Radish..(which I still think about)...And THIS book...( which I still think about)and now two others: \u201cFair and Tender Ladies\u201d by Lee Smith and\u201cThe Gunners\u201d by Rebecca Kauffman BOTH of these two books I\u2019m currently reading are EACH SOO GOOD - it\u2019s a race to the finish line - as to which I\u2019ll finish first... as I\u2019m now so \u2018deeply\u2019 involved- in ecstasy reading both books (Listening to \u201cThe Gunners\u201d during the day.. reading \u201cFair and Tender Ladies at night and middle of the night)My mind is swimming with wonderful feelings and thoughts and experiences of great created characters from our books Little friends in our head.So... there are MANY VARIED REVIEWS on\u201cTHE AMERICAN MARRIAGE\u201d....I\u2019m only going to add one more final thought:Opinion really! I honestly believe there is something of great value in this book for: women- men- married or single - black - white - any nationality- all legal adult ages - young 20\u2019s on up. I mentioned in my little review that this book is a great \u2018 examination of marriage...I ALSO think it\u2019s a great discussion whether or not to MARRY or NOT in this day and age. There is \u2018something\u2019 ( no spoilers) - to pay close attention to at the beginning of this book... BEFORE MARRIAGE...We\u2019ve ALL had those experiences where our gut is warning us \u2014 something doesn\u2019t feel right - our souls don\u2019t feel secure & safe\u2014but then as thinking beings\u2014 we\u2019ve intellectualized the situation and let it go...only later to kick ourselves for not taking the GUT MESSAGE more serious. There was a \u2018red flag\u2019 moment in this story ..that I knew was going to come back to \u2018haunt\u2019 ... and it did. My heart ached at that moment.The ending of this book is also powerful - and in my opinion clearly sends a message.Not only had every character been broken\u2014 but culture conditions of injustice proved to be devastating too. EVERYONE WAS AFFECTED FROM THE HORRIFIC INJUSTICE...but sadly - facing reality\u2014personal problems didn\u2019t get swept under the rug. Small problems didn\u2019t get replaced with bigger ones. Brene Brown talks about learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. \u201cThe American Marriage\u201d plays out those type of dialogues of communication. Characters were practicing being comfortable with very uncomfortable communication. Truthful dialogue surfaced through letters. Later, face to face.Original... little review: Phenomenal intimate gut-wrenching storytelling. Every character has been wounded. Their struggles are REAL. Personally I had empathy for everyone\u2014 but I can understand if readers favor one character over another. There are complex uncomfortable situations throughout. I could imagine how each person felt from their point of view. I felt those emotions, too.This novel is definitely a \u2018discussion\u2019 book...an examination of marriage: what happens when horrific circumstances literally change the direction of life? EVERYONE IS AFFECTED! EVERYONE reacts differently! I\u2019ve much admiration for the wisdom \u2014the depths \u2014 of understanding that Jones has for all the many types of relationships we have in our lives. I need to get some sleep ...I\u2019ll continue the rest of this review tomorrow or over the weekend.", "An American Marriage by Tayari Jones is a 2018 Algonquin Books publication. Well drawn characterizations and a thought provoking and timely topic combines to make a potent blend, which kept me riveted to the pages of this book. Roy had done everything right, is successful, married to a beautiful woman, living the American dream- until he is falsely accused of rape and sent to prison.Celestial finds her comfortable life turned on its axis after Roy is incarcerated. She remains loyal to her husband, but as the years pass, her life continues to move forward, while Roy\u2019s stagnates behind bars, and her feelings for him begin to wane, prompting her to seek comfort from another man.Meanwhile, lawyers are working round the clock to get Roy\u2019s conviction overturned- which miraculously, after serving five years, it is!! But, Roy, soon learns that easing back into his former life and resuming his marriage with Celestial is easier said than done. What stands out for me in this novel, are the little nuances. Roy, who opens the dialogue in the first chapter, drew me in with his honesty, and humor, which was occasionally sheepish and self- deprecating, even though I disapproved of some of his actions. Celestial was, for some reason, a character I found difficult to warm up to at first, but upon reflection, I think her character may have gone through the most productive growth of all. Celestial\u2019s needs and expectations are different from Roy\u2019s ideals, some of which can be attributed to male/female roles and expectations in a marriage, and others to their own individuality. But, throw in a HUGE live altering test of the marriage and it will either strengthen or fall apart. Which way did things go for Roy and Celestial?The other timely topics explored have to do with racism and mass incarceration. Prison life is fraught with danger and loneliness, and of course Roy missed his former life, but it was simple things, things we so easily take for granted that makes the bleakness of his situation come alive. Despite their flaws, and each party has their fair share of them, they were basically ordinary people thrown in an extraordinary circumstance and left to cope with those circumstances as best they could. They were both human, with real needs, desires, hopes, and dreams. Both made excuses, both played the blame game, but both have a bond together they find hard to break free of. The epistolary parts of the novel were well done, which exposes both the closeness and the awkwardness of the marriage, but also the way time robbed them of the growth marriages need to survive. The secondary characters were added depth and conflict and were also very well drawn, and equally affected by the outcome of Roy and Celetial's marriage.While the book is not filled with action or suspense, or even, despite the heaviness of the situation, is it melodramatic, with one exception, that, to be honest, almost had to happen, to break the tension that boiled to the surface. There were a few tense moments that made me pretty uncomfortable, but mostly the author just allowed the characters to flow, to take charge, and dictate the pacing. This approach sounds understated and maybe even underwhelming, but this story was incredibly absorbing, and I have to say the conclusion was surprising- but at the same time- not. Despite some misgivings and mixed emotions about how the characters ended up, overall, I think they may be exactly where they need to be, both as individuals and as a couple. It may be tempting to take sides, but I can\u2019t say I would do better or worse in that same situation, but I did struggle with passing judgments on occasion. Either way, this is a well written examination of relationships and human foibles, and how otherwise normal, well intentioned, good people face adversity and come out on the other end of it changed, for better or worse.  4 stars", "Is it possible that in mid-February I\u2019ve already read my favorite book of 2018? An American Marriage was outstanding. Not only did I immediately become hooked and stay invested in the story, the quality of the writing was pure excellence. A newlywed couple, Roy and Celestial, are early on in their marriage when Roy is sentenced to 12 years in jail for a crime he did not commit. This changes the course of their lives and feelings, and the story unfolds from here. Roy\u2019s conviction is overturned 5 years into his sentence too, changing things once again.\u201dBut home isn\u2019t where you land; home is where you launch. You can\u2019t pick your home any more than you can choose your family. In poker, you get five cards. Three of them you can swap out, but two are yours to keep: family and native land.\u201dThere were different points in the book where I disliked all three of the primary characters, however I was so engrossed I had to keep reading to find out how this story would play out. I feel like there was excess in trying to frame Celestial as an independent woman though - Outside of a professional sense, I didn\u2019t find her to be that independent at all. Her actions, to me, definitely indicated otherwise. I liked that while Roy and Celestial were both adults, their parents still played a central role in the story. I also enjoyed the many authentic Atlanta references throughout the book. \u201dBut how you feel love and how you understand love are two different things. ... Human emotion is beyond comprehension, smooth and uninterrupted, like an orb made of blown glass.\u201dAn American Marriage portrays realistic behaviors and actions people experience, themselves and through others, and this is why I enjoyed it so immensely. While I just didn\u2019t want it to end, I really liked the ending.", "Edited 9/20 to add: My book club discussed this last night and while not everyone loved the book (but no one disliked it), it made for a lively and interesting discussion. I'd highly recommend for book clubs.I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m in the outlier club with this one. What I liked:-\tThe writing is gorgeous. 4-5 stars for the beauty of the prose. Plus the author writes in a way that sounds like the way real people think and talk-\tThe letters Celestial and Roy exchanged-\tHow one unfortunate tragic event, unfair as it was, can totally change the trajectory of your life. It gives food for thought.-\tit was thought-provoking with complex moral themes surrounding loyalty and marriageWhat I didn\u2019t like:-\tThe characters. While I sympathized with their plight I just didn\u2019t like them. Which I can\u2019t explain because I usually like my characters somewhat complicated and flawed. Unlikability is not a deal breaker, but I like what I like and often I can\u2019t even explain why I am so turned off by some characters.-\tThe plot \u2013 after the beginning I just stopped caring. It felt like I was reading the script of a cheesy movie. There\u2019s a time and place for cheesy, it just wasn\u2019t what I was expecting when I went into this book.-\tThe epilogue! My eyes may have rolled more than once. I will definitely read anything else the author writes because I found this book so well-written and her style so engaging, but this one just didn't quite work for me. It all boiled down to plot.", "I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people like this book. If it weren\u2019t for Oprah loving it, I honestly do not think people would buy it. There was no plot and it is the most boring book I\u2019ve ever read. Basically if you read the synopsis, you\u2019ve read all the \u201cexciting\u201d parts and know the entire plot. It\u2019s technically an easy read but boring overall. I powered through to finish it since it has so many positive reviews, with the hopes that it would suddenly turn around or have an amazing ending that would make it worth reading. Major disappointment.", "One sock officially knocked off!!! (equals 4.5 rounded up up up!)I look a little funny on my pogo stick (yes, this is a pogo stick kind of book) since I have just one sock on, but I have my reasons, really I do. The reason is that there was a slump for me in the middle of the story, so that one sock just held onto my foot like nobody\u2019s business. But it was a short-lived slump, and the beginning and the end of the book are so insanely powerful, the other sock almost flew off my other foot. Since I can\u2019t ignore the slump\u2014where there was a teensy dash of god and ghosts (my most un-favorite set of \u201cgees\u201d)\u2014I have to bounce around on the pogo stick with just one foot al fresco. Fine by me.Okay, okay, enough about my stupid socks. No need to talk about feet, for god\u2019s sake. The main point is I\u2019m flying high on my pogo stick because this book is amazing! So much depth and emotion! I just finished and I must write this review immediately so I transfer my excitement to the page while it\u2019s rip-roarin\u2019 hot. Here is how I felt: hyper-happy, then a yawn (and the threat of a Complaint Board), then hyper-happy on steroids.Hyper-happy. OMG what a great beginning! My favorite part was a series of intense letters between the married couple, Roy and Celestial. Wow are the letters loaded. There is conflict, misunderstandings, gentle accusations. Each point of view is real and honest and argumentative. This is what I call psychological action. Each of them cornered, they say what they really think. There is blame yet no blame. No sugar coating.What? I want more letters! Where did they go? They left and took the juice with them. Yep, about halfway through, I started to yawn. This was the beginning of the slump that kept my one sock on, tight, and made me consider dragging out the Complaint Board. Why couldn\u2019t the whole book be in letters? Even though I started out by getting attached to the characters, now I started feeling detached. And damn, I skidded on a patch of God, where it appeared in a whole short chapter, plus at the beginning of the next. Other scenes I didn\u2019t like were a funeral and a visit to a graveyard. I know it\u2019s just me, but I usually don\u2019t like ceremonies\u2014in books or in real life (unless something big and surprising happens). The ghost appears at the graveyard scene, where a dead mom gives advice: be a good man, blah blah blah. I thought that it was sort of clich\u00e9d.  Hyper-happy on steroids! Soon after the offending slump, I grabbed my pogo stick again. I wouldn\u2019t think of pulling out the Complaint Board now. Hot damn! This is what I call high drama, and I loved it. It\u2019s not melodramatic and it\u2019s not over-the-top. It\u2019s an incredibly realistic portrayal of marriage, a marriage that had to sustain a five-year separation. There is so much conflict, so much tension between the couple, I was riveted. This author gets into the heads of Roy and Celestial, and what we get is this tremendously insightful psychological story about the strength of love, guilt, expectations, disconnects. The author does an amazing job in making you empathize with Roy and his situation. He is flawed, however, and you don\u2019t always accept his choices or actions\u2014but you still love him. The dialogue is some of the most realistic I\u2019ve read, and the story is as much about what isn\u2019t uttered as about what is. It\u2019s sharp, edgy, and honest. It has to do with illusions and delusions and hope and loyalty. It raises questions about relationships and morality. We know, for instance, that the reason for the separation, and what happened during that time, is no one\u2019s fault. Feelings develop, feelings change\u2014at least for some. Time changes things whether we like it or not. What is love and can people move on? Should you act on feelings when you know you shouldn\u2019t? Do you stick it out when you really don\u2019t want to? Can hope be powerful enough to get you what you want? It\u2019s so much about the nuances of love and about how being apart can change things majorly. I don\u2019t want to say anything about the plot, even about the big event at the beginning of the book that changes the course of Celestial\u2019s and Roy\u2019s life. I just love going into things cold, so that everything is a surprise. To me, that\u2019s part of the fun of reading. Oh, I will say that I\u2019ve read a few too many thrillers recently, because at the beginning I thought what was going on was sinister. Ha! No! Far from it! The book shows the severe consequences of social injustice (the cast is African-American) but it is in no way a message book.I always love it when a character does something you don\u2019t expect. And that\u2019s what is so cool about this book. When Roy returns after five years, I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen, and I loved every single surprise in behavior. There was this edge, this fear, although I kept telling myself that nothing bad would actually happen. Or would it? I must say I was so attached to both characters by that time. I felt like I knew them really well, yet they kept acting in ways I wasn\u2019t expecting. Much wringing of my hands, but I was rooting for them both, bigtime. The dilemma they faced seemed to have no possible good resolution. My eyes did not leave the pages for hours. The way the book ends is brilliant.I must say, too, that the writing is fantastic. There are little bits of wisdom throughout. Here is a sample of her wonderful words:\u201cShe was no bigger than a minute, so I bent my back to sweep her feet up off the porch and she laughed musical like a xylophone.\u201d\u201cSomehow she rearranges the ions in the air and you can\u2019t breathe as well.\u201d\u201cIn poker, you get five cards. Three of them you can swap out, but two are yours to keep: family and native land.\u201d\u201cHis laughter broke whatever sticky spell bound us to the house, and we were able to leave.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like the difference between a raw egg and a scrambled egg. It\u2019s the same thing, but it\u2019s not the same at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a butterscotch still sealed in the wrapper.\u201d\u201cEven while she wore his ring, she wasn\u2019t his wife. She was merely a married woman.\u201d\u201cThe secrets blocked my throat like a tumor.\u201dI just remembered that long ago I read another novel by Jones, called Silver Sparrow. Ann Patchett recommended it, and since I was enamored with Patchett\u2019s State of Wonder, I jumped to read any book she dangled in front of my face. I remember that I liked Silver Sparrow and was super impressed by the writing, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what it\u2019s about. An American Marriage, on the other hand, will stick with me, I\u2019m sure.I\u2019m still hopping inside, hyper-happy, pretty manic. I was skeptical about reading this book, since it\u2019s an Oprah selection and thus will be a big seller. (Big sellers are often a letdown.) I\u2019m SO glad I didn\u2019t miss this one. The characters are complex, their relationship is messy, and the story is profound. Now let me continue down the road on my pogo stick, the other sock threatening to fly off\u2026", "Roy has done the best he could with the life he was given. Now married to Celestial, a young woman with dreams of her own, are traveling to meet his parents for the first time. The visit will prove less than successful, and a terrible miscarriage of Justice will occur that will detail their young lives and marriage.These are characters to that one wants to root for, wants things to turn out well for them. Of course, life seldom works that way, things change, circumstances beyond ones control interfere. A story where events shape a future, where a chance meeting changes a life, where the only bad guy is the Justice system, a system it is almost impossible to defeat. The high cost of incarceration, prisons full of young black men, many times not given a voice, not believed or railroaded by a system who believes the must be guilty. For Roy, his life will never be the same. He must fight to remember who he was, where he was and what he wanted in his life.This author does an amazing job detailing the crisis in a marriage that was interrupted by the system. Her writing is clear, concise, but pointed and sharp. The characters fully developed people with wants and needs of their own. The love of a family, a father who cares for a son that was not always his, and a young woman who must make a decision that will definitely her life going forward. Quite a book, quite a story.ARC from Edelweiss.", "4 stars! This was a beautifully written, thought-provoking, slow burn novel that crept its way into my heart, settling deep within my bones. I will be thinking of these characters long after finishing this book.This story follows Roy and Celestial, a young newlywed couple who have a passionate and impetuous relationship \u2013 loving deeply and arguing stubbornly. They are from different \u201cworlds\u201d, but have found an explosive love and connection with one another. Less than two years after getting married, Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years in prison for a crime Celestial knows he did not commit. The story is narrated by both Roy and Celestial, along with Celestial\u2019s childhood friend Andre. There are several letters included throughout the story between various characters, mainly Roy and Celestial while he is in prison. These letters were a brilliant addition to the story \u2013 my connection with the characters grew stronger as each letter was revealed. The author, Tayari Jones, writes with such beauty and clarity. I was fully invested in this emotional and chaotic story, rooting for these characters to overcome their devastating situation. My heart has made a special spot for \u201cBig Roy\u201d, Roy\u2019s father \u2013 he was an outstanding and unforgettable character \u2013 I simply adored him!I highly recommend this deep and touching book. It took a few chapters to pull me in, so be prepared for a slow burn that will gradually make its way into your soul.", "I decided to pick up An American Marriage because Tayari Jones has a fun instagram. Also in her By The Book in the New York Times she recounts that she once accepted a gig in Dubai just because the flight gave her nineteen uninterrupted hours of reading time. I love that. She seems like such a fun and likeable person. Therefore it really does hurt to write that An American Marriage savagely disappointed me.The novel concerns a married couple, Roy and Celestial, who live a fairly normal life until Roy is sent to jail for allegedly raping another woman. Whilst in jail, Roy and Celestial try to keep the marriage going as normal but when Celestial experiences surprise success with her doll company everything between our couple begins to buckle and wane. I\u2019ll begin with what I admired about this novel. I adore Jones\u2019 turn of phrase. She has a very biting and almost sarcastic writing style which complements the plot well. Take this little sentence, which I loved, for example: \u2018\u201cWho are these men?\u201d the white cop asked me. His accent was thick and gooey, all Marietta, turn left at the Big Chicken.\u2019Isn\u2019t that just wonderful? There\u2019s little lines like that strewn throughout the novel like confetti.The novel is also very well structured. It employs three narrators, each rewarded a perspective, as the plot flows through their voices. Oftentimes I\u2019m quite \u2018meh\u2019 about constantly changing perspectives but Jones makes it work flawlessly. She has a real master touch.However, no matter how much I polish it up, there\u2019s no helping the plot of An American Marriage. Oprah recently chose this novel as her book club choice and, no offence to Oprah (I mean, she did get your aunt to read Anna Karenina) but this novel is such an Oprah Book Club pick.This novel reeks of Lifetime Original Movie. There are some moments that are just achingly sentimental whilst Jones often seeps into melodrama. The climax of the novel, a scene which I won\u2019t spoil but tree huggers beware, was meant to be this great symbolic event in which every bottled emotion is finally unleashed. And I found myself\u2026 howling. Just howling at the utter ridiculousness of it. Talk about forcing a metaphor. Jeez.Thankfully this novel hasn\u2019t put me off Tayari Jones. I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about all of her other novels and I\u2019m excited to get to them. But as for An American Marriage, I\u2019m glad that Oprah saw something in it that I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not Oprah. Even if I do share her devotion to bread.", " Winner of the 2019 Women's Prize for Fiction   Audiobook performed by Sean Crisden & Eisa Davis 9h  I really enjoyed the performance of these narrators as they breathe life into Tayari Jones' story. They definitely kept me riveted to my seat as the triple narrative between Celestial, Roy, and Andre unfolded. Given the title, the central story really is about this couple's marriage-their courtship and all that comes after. It was all the family relationships that convinced me this book was a solid 4 star rating. Oh and how I loved both Big Roy and Mr.Davenport! Their roles proved to be the cogs to keep the main storyline full of momentum as they challenged the three major protagonists over and over again. Since its publication on Feb 6/18 and with Oprah's seal of approval \"An American Marriage\" is certainly heating up social media. Goodreads has over ten thousand strong reviews and it appears that this book is appealing to a wide range of diverse readers. Not all the reviews are glowing, but I believe that I have enjoyed reading all the various perspectives to the same degree that I have enjoyed reading/listening to this audio version. Thanks to my Goodreads friend, La Tonya for the recommendation.", "One of the things I liked the most about this novel is that a portion of the book is comprised of letters, mostly between Roy while in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit and his wife Celestial. Letter writing seems like it\u2019s from a bygone time and I never feel as if e-mail and certainly not texts adequately reflect the intimate picture of ourselves that a hand written letter does. This is not just about the intimate look at this one relationship, but it\u2019s about their families and their pasts. On another level though, it\u2019s a commentary on the judicial system that isn\u2019t always fair and of the racism reflected in the prison system. Through these letters and their alternating narratives as well as Andre, who is Celestial\u2019s life long friend, the complexity of these individuals is depicted. It becomes clear in many ways how their pasts and their family situations shaped them as the adults they are today, but it isn\u2019t clear about what their decisions will be moving forward when it is determined that Roy is innocent and is released from prison after serving five years. I was impressed with how evenly these characters are portrayed. I equally liked and disliked each of them at different times. The two characters that I had no reservations about were Ray\u2019s parents Big Ray and Olive who loved Ray unconditionally. A lot of times like so many other readers I suspect, when we\u2019re in the middle of a book we have an idea, a hope perhaps, of how we want the story to conclude . I wasn\u2019t sure how I wanted this to end and I was surprised, but satisfied when I read the epilogue. Even though Roy and Celestial had been married for just over a year before he is incarcerated, it was sad that the racial injustices of the system, of society overall took from them the next five years of their marriage. A thought provoking and moving story for sure.Thanks to Diane for sending me this book. ", "\n(3.5?) This book was heartbreaking but also quite frustrating and exhausting.I'm reading this Contemporary as part of my \"Goodreads Reading Challenge\" and it's not something I would usually have picked up but I understand why it's so popular. Newlyweds struggle with their lives as Roy is falsy accused of raping a woman. The book deals with love, race, justice (or really injustice) and will leave you devastated.\n", "\nThat ending...Writing- 4 starsCharacters- 3 starsLanguage- 3 starsPlot/Concept- 2 starsUgh! Those people exhaust me. Only the parents and Davina were likable. Can't forget about the Uncle who helped Roy. I didn't like Celestial's mother either.\n", "\"I feel like I need and need and need and it's wearing a hole in the fabric.\"Celestial and Roy's marriage is just breaking ground as a young seedling when the earth ravages the soil and the fissures play havoc with such gentle growth. Roy has been accused of a rape that he did not commit. His kindness to a down-and-out woman has spun around on him. No matter how many times that Celestial recants the story that Roy was with her all night, the court hears otherwise. Roy will serve his time....twelve years to be exact.Tayari Jones weaves her story through a series of powerful letters written back and forth between the married couple after Roy is incarcerated. You readily feel the depth of the devastation wrought upon these two as evidenced by this jarring correspondence that reveals an ebb and flow of intensifying and waning emotions swept up in this remorseful stew. Jones packs her dialogue with the razor edge of bitter consequences of life that will alter these two individuals forever. \"You've got to work with the God you were given.\"Jones' prose will rest heavily upon you. It is raw, pulls-no-punches, and is, without question, painfully brutal in its telling. She seems to ask us just how much velocity from the violent storms of life can we tolerate before completely shattering? Is it possible to cleave to one another when time and place separate us so radically? At first, Celestial believes that love can change its shape. Roy ponders this exceedingly. And, furthermore, do we both see the same images anymore in the darkness and stillness of night that has visited upon us? Perhaps and perhaps not.You will sit with this one for a while after reading the last page. No cookie-cutter ending here.....just reality served up with plenty of forks in the road. Some expected and some maybe not. Life rumbles in and the aftermath is not always planned beautifully and gracefully in the stars. We just do, folks, under completely different constellations this time. Highly recommend this one.", "\nNothing is ever over.This was beautiful. This was a slow roil. A story told with realistic dialogue. A story littered with metaphors. A story sprinkled with wisdom.I listened to the audio and it was sublime...so gorgeous were the cadence and rhythm that I was often mesmerized, wrapped up in the story and swept away by what felt like a foreign language and a different culture. Highly recommend. 4.75 stars\n", "4 Compelling Stars.Marriage, on its own is a complicated venture. Throw in anything else and Kapow! Everyone always says that first year of marriage is the hardest. For Celestial and Roy, nothing will prepare them for what is to come. Madly in love, they think they can conquer the world. Such wishful thinking. After being married for a year, Roy gets arrested for a crime he didn\u2019t commit and is sentenced to twelve years in Prison. Twelve years. What a great start to their marriage. Initially, Celestial tries to be the dutiful, supportive loving wife, visiting and writing him, but as the months and years pass, it get harder and harder. Told via letters exchanged between Roy and Celestial, this is a novel through which emotion flows like a river: sometimes, lazy and easy, and sometimes, like the river wild. Have you ever exchanged letters with someone? Real letters? Not just cards or emails? They are more heartfelt, full of either friendship or romance and are a way to stay connected..and that is true here in \u201cAn American Marriage.\u201d Roy\u2019s letters to Celestial are real, full of love, feeling and need, changing over time, becoming bitter and angry. Celestial\u2019s are loving, more reserved, more grounded. Always. In my opinion however, neither character is likable, one even less than the other. Though I didn\u2019t love either character, or any of the peripheral characters for the most part, this book resonated with me in a way that most would not. It brings forth feelings of anger, injustice, love and sorrow. It makes your heart hurt.. tears filling your eyes. \u201cAn American Marriage\u201d is a novel about racism, love and friendship, the trials and tribulations of marriage and the ramifications of the choices we make and those that are made for you. It is compelling and completely thought-provoking and I highly recommend it.Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 5.13.18. ", "I had never heard of this book. This kind of thing would never really be on my radar anyway. I don\u2019t read a lot of books about marriage, relationships, love, etc.But, listen, when Oprah tells you to read something, you read it. That\u2019s just how the world works. I remember that fateful day, sitting on my couch, watching The Today Show or something like that. They kept teasing the big reveal of Oprah\u2019s new book club book. Coming up right after the break. Coming up right after this. We will be right back with the new Oprah thing. Oprah coming up. Stay turned for a book. Books coming right up. Oprah. Book club. Read. Oprah. Stay tuned. Don\u2019t move. Hang in there. Right after this. After these messages. Here we go!Finally, after what felt like hours of weight loss tips, ways to get organized, gardening, Donald Trump, weather, and summer fashion, this book was revealed. I was so disappointed. First of all, I don\u2019t even know why I cared in the first place. When I heard what the book was about I was not enthused and rolled like a sloth off of the couch on to the floor. I just laid there in a daze for a while, and then I found a way to carry on with the rest of my day. Later that week, I walked into the library and there was An American Marriage right there in an American library for an American to read. So I checked it out. And I didn\u2019t read it. Recently, I found the audiobook on my trusty Overdrive app so I downloaded it. This time I actually followed through and listened to it. I listened to the first half in one day, took a break, and listened to the second had today. And, hey, I really enjoyed listening to it. I had honestly forgotten about the plot so as the book jumped around in the early chapters I was legitimately surprised. It took so abrupt turns that kept me engaged, and the conflict between the handful of characters in the story felt real and emotional and raw. Everything kind of slowly builds up and explodes in the end, but I honestly found myself caught up in the story he whole time. Shout out to Oprah for bringing this to my attention.

Now that I\u2019ve read it, I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s why many users rated it so high as well. I actively avoided it for months because I wasn\u2019t quite sure if I was still a drinker of the Oprah Kool-Aid and wanted to maintain my fond memories of a bygone era. But then a co-worker told me about a podcast she listened to where Tayari Jones was interviewed and convinced me to add my name to the waiting list because she sounded so nice. There\u2019s a good chance that she\u2019s the nicest person in the universe . . . . but the characters she wrote about sure weren\u2019t.For me, it all boils down to . . . . \n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t respect the institution.\u201d\nWhile I don\u2019t believe that is the case, the message that THESE YOUNG PEOPLE in particular didn\u2019t respect the institution of marriage was broadcast loud and clear throughout the duration of this novel. As a woman who has been married for 22 years, let me tell you this story pissed me plum the fuck off. These people weren\u2019t in an \u201cAmerican Marriage\u201d \u2013 or if they were I\u2019m declaring I want different categories because they didn\u2019t even LIKE each other FFS. He was an overgrown manchild who screwed women on the side while vilifying his \u201clittle missus\u201d for not being interested in getting knocked up on their honeymoon. She was so worried about losing herself to a man that she wouldn\u2019t give ANY part of herself for the greater good of their union. Their \u201cmarriage\u201d of a year and a half was full of lies and omissions and both of them sickened me. I\u2019m a person who LOVES reading about the underdog or the \u201cbad\u201d guy. I don\u2019t shy away from vile characters \u2013 often times I even find myself cheering for them. But these people? Ugh. If this is what \u201creal\u201d people are like then let me stay in my bubble because I could just vomit. From giving up on her supposedly innocent husband nearly instantaneously (don\u2019t argue semantics \u2013 just because she pretended to stay with him for two years doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t move on with her life/career immediately), to falling into bed with her childhood friend (and again, this relationship had zero actual love that translated to the page \u2013 only convenience and a copout) to him having a one-night-stand with a woman the day he\u2019s out of prison and then informing his wife that he could rape her if he wanted to when she dares to tell him he needs to use protection if they are going to have sex (while she\u2019s supposedly engaged to her (and his \u2013 can\u2019t forget they were college buddies) best pal). Again - vomit. I don\u2019t know this reviewer, but the first few lines of THIS REVIEW asks the questions I kept asking myself. The answer for me? My rating comes from how much I enjoyed a book \u2013 not for its literary merit. I LOATHED this book, its characters, the glossing over the trial/incarceration/appeal/etc., its jumping of the shark that somehow a man whose father ran out on his mother when he was but a baby somehow MAGICALLY ends up in not only the same penal institution (and don\u2019t forget there\u2019s roughly 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE currently incarcerated in the United States), but also winds up his cellie in some attempt at tragi-porn that never delivers ANNNNNNND the beyond the grave letter from his dearly departed mama. GTFOOH. It doesn\u2019t matter that the writing was clearly good, the snippets of imprisonment left me wanting more of that story, the final showdown in the front yard FINALLY offered me something to believe in or Big Roy . . . . . \n\u201cWhen I look at Mr. Roy out there, at his wife\u2019s grave, I feel like I\u2019ve been playing at marriage. That I don\u2019t know what it is to be committed.\u201d\nOh Big Roy. You were nearly enough to make me change my mind, but I\u2019m sticking to my guns and this solo star.Nearly ALL of my friends loved this novel thoroughly. There\u2019s a good chance you will too. After all, the power of Oprah compels you. And if you think I\u2019m kidding about that, here\u2019s a pic I took last night when my kid challenged me to a \u201cminute to win it\u201d type of event where I pulled all the Oprah books I could off the shelves while he timed me . . . . . \n\n", "Celestial and Roy have only been married a bit over a year when he\u2019s found guilty of a crime.

In the blink of an eye, they go from living \u201cthat Huxtable life\u201d to Roy being in prison. The author gets certain things exactly right, like being caught between a parent and a spouse. And how little we really know about our spouse when we go into marriage. Prison forces Celestial and Roy to write each other and in writing, they initially give up their secrets. They\u2019re forced to communicate. But then they don\u2019t. Or rather, they don\u2019t understand where the other is coming from. These two have problems with a capital P. The meat of the story really rings true. We can\u2019t predict how things will turn out for us. Bad things happen and we are forced to deal with them, deserved or not. Jones has a definite voice. I can\u2019t say for sure whether the way the main characters speak is realistic, but it sure seems that way to me.

Roy is a smart, upwardly mobile career man. Celestial is an up and coming artist. Newly married and optimistic, their future is bright. Andre is Celestial\u2019s closest friend.When a catastrophic incident occurs a little way into the book, Roy and Celestial\u2019s new life together receives the ultimate test and is pushed to breaking point.The fact that the main players are black is intrinsic to the story.This tale of complicated relationships, although universal, is seen through the prism of race. There\u2019s a seam that runs through the book, a world weary acceptance that racism still taints much of society. Not always clearly visible but always present. Race was certainly the defining factor in the dramatic incident on which the novel turns.The story has the propulsion and urgency of a thriller and yet .......... the constant flashbacks and inner monologues of the principle characters, cause the narrative to stall. It\u2019s fair enough that the author didn\u2019t want to tell the tale in a strictly chronological or linear way, but I found myself getting a little impatient at times. A five star read down to a four.That being said, An America Marriage is a well written, character driven novel - thoughtful, humane and believable. A superior piece of fiction.", "\nThe strongest writing I've read in a while. Witty in all the right places. Rich characters. The plot isn't ultra-memorable but I have the feeling it's going to haunt me the more I think about it.

Oprah has never let me down with her book choices!A terrible racial injustice has occurred that rips apart the marriage of a black couple, Roy and Celestial after only a year of marriage. The storytelling is stellar and the characters are just so real. Very moving! Recommended!\n", "Rating 4.5At the heart of this one is the story of Celestial and Roy. They are a young married couple with so much ahead of them. I would not say they had the perfect marriage or knew what marriage is really about in the beginning. They had money, good jobs, a promising life together, and then it was all shattered.This is a in-depth story told from the point of view of both Celestrial and Roy and their friend, Andre. It also includes letters between them interweaving them into the story. Celestrial comes from money, her parents have money. Roy does not come from money, his parents seem to struggle. But Roy pushes himself in college and finally has a good high paying job. On a trip to see Roy's family, Celestrial and Roy decide to stay at hotel overnight. During this time, Roy is accused of rape - no spoiler here. He didn't do it, but is sent to prison for 12 years. His crime itself is not central in the story. It's never discussed other than he is sent to prison. And here you see how this impacts the marriage of Celestrial and Roy. It is such a wonderful, character driven novel. You see the struggles they face while Roy is incarcerated. You see from both points of view. You get the back story of their lives and how they met. Then, after years of his lawyer fighting his case, the lawyer being paid for by Celestrial's parents, he is freed. After 5 years away, he's ready to return home, to his wife, to his previous life. But that's just it...it WAS his *previous* life. Everything is different now. Celestrial has found comfort in the arms of their friend Andre. And after all this time, no one is the same person.I really enjoyed this one. I listened to the audio version and the narrators did a wonderful job. I felt that Roy and Celestrial were telling me their story. I was so immersed into this one and kept listening to more and more cause I had to hear how it would end, but I didn't want it to end. I was initially drawn by cover love, then I was sucked into by the wonderful story. I did not know who this author was but you can bet I'll be reading more by her. Why not a 5...well, I'm stingy. But the very end, the epilogue just went off the rails a bit for me. And one other item kinda threw me off. Finally, I would not read this one again. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it and would suggest to anyone to read. It's just, I know what happens. I'm so glad I read this and I'm sure I will be thinking of it for some time."], "genre": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Audiobook", "Literary Fiction", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Cultural", "African American", "Book Club", "Novels", "Romance"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/54403192-an-american-marriage", "avg_ratings": "3.96", "ShelvedNumber": "2272"}

I'm trying so hard to get on the Christina Lauren fanwagon, but there are just lots of little things that aren't floating my boat. The Unhoneymooners is not bad at all. It's quite funny and enjoyable for the most part, actually. It's just... well, I'll start with the first thing I noticed. This is only the second Christina Lauren book I have tried, with the other being Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating, and yet right away I realized that the characters were virtually identical. Both Olive and Hazel are klutzy, embarrassing heroines who don't know when to stop talking, each with notably amazing boobs. Ethan and Josh are both aloof, cynical guys who supposedly view their respective heroines with disdain until they, um, don't anymore. And they are both - I'm quoting here - boob men (curious - does this boob thing come up in all their books?).Boob joking aside, Olive and Ethan could just as easily be Josh and Hazel. They read like the same couple. Also, I see a lot of reviewers talking about this promised \"enemies-to-lovers\" romance, but I'm just not that convinced. I am a sucker for the love/hate relationship thing, I'll be honest. I don't know why. Add it to my list of issues. But whether it's Jardan or Spuffy or the good old Fitzbeth, I'm all for a bit of \"I hate you, let's fuck\" angst. Olive and Ethan, though, are not enemies. Sure, she calls him her \"nemesis\" and declares how awful it's going to be going to Maui with him, blah blah, but it seems pretty clear to me from the beginning that they really love bickering with each other. They don't hate each other! They're not enemies! Their first conversation makes them seem like an old married couple bitching at each other. In fact, I find it weird how Olive basically fabricates some faux-hatred at the start, but is later very easily forgiving when, in my opinion, Ethan was completely in the wrong.So far this has definitely sounded more negative, but it is a fun, easy read. I like how both Olive and Hazel are unwilling to apologize for who they are and the way their bodies look. I like the back-and-forth between Olive and Ethan:\n\u201cEthan, I\u2019m a terrible liar.\u201d\u201cReally? You hid it so well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never been my strength, okay? Those of us who aren\u2019t summoned by the Dark Mark consider honesty to be a virtue.\u201d\nI also really liked the single perspective of this story. Seeing as almost every romance novel these days has multiple perspectives, I must be in the minority on this one, but I actually find it much easier to enjoy a romance and fall in love with the object of the MC's affections if I'm reading a single perspective. Getting inside the other person's head dampens some of the tension for me.Oh, and I also liked the super hot massage scene. For obvious reasons.Hell, I don't even know at this point. It's not like I'm not having a bit of mindless fun with these books, but with so little time to read, do I really want to keep spending it with 3-star reads? Huh. Maybe I'll try one more.

It's engaging, funny, and sexy. But the co-written aspect of this novel makes itself known as the storyline morphs into a more dramatic second half with several climaxes related to career, trust, family, and relationships. In my opinion, this reading experience felt like two different books were placed under the same cover, and I quite liked the fun one more. However, overall, The Unhoneymooners is indeed enjoyable and will surely satisfy Christina and Lauren's many fans.

This generosity did not impact my honesty when rating/reviewing.Source: NetGalleyAuthor: Christina LaurenPublisher: Gallery Books: Gallery, Threshold, Pocket BooksGenres: Romance Pub Date: May 14, 2019", "ARC provided by Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point of luck: it happens when and where it happens.\u201d\n\nThis is my favorite Christina Lauren book since Roomies! I\u2019ll be honest, I wasn\u2019t too in love with Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating or My Favorite Half-Night Stand, but this felt like the famous duo was back and resecured that special place in my swoon-worthy romance heart. This was so funny, this was so heartwarming, and since I\u2019m leaving in a few weeks for Hawaii, the setting was pretty perfect for me, too! This is a hate to love, enemies to lovers, fake dating romance that features two characters who are forced to be around each other because their siblings are marrying each other. \u27bd Olive Torres - Biracial (white and Mexican), twin of the bride, has been unlucky her entire life. \u27bd Ethan Thomas - Brother of the groom, and Olive\u2019s archnemesis. \n\n\u201cI want to say something sassy, but the only coherent thought that comes to mind is how insulting it is that eyelashes like his were wasted on Satan\u2019s Errand Boy, so I just give a perfunctory nod and turn down the hall.\u201d\n\nAnd these two had a very rocky, and very confusing, first meeting. But they are trying their best to put their differences aside for this wedding, even if they are antagonizing each other every single chance they get. But the wedding takes an unexpected turn when everyone gets sick from the seafood buffet that was served, except for Olive and Ethan, since neither of them ate from it. Their siblings insist that they take their Hawaii honeymoon, instead of letting the trip go to waste! And they both decide to, because once they get to Maui, they won\u2019t have to see each other except for sleeping. That is, until Olive's boss and Ethan\u2019s ex fianc\u00e9 happen to be at the same resort, and they are forced to play the part of happy newlyweds, because Olive doesn\u2019t want to get caught using their sibling\u2019s honeymoon by the resort and be forced to pay for it out of their own pocket, and Ethan doesn\u2019t want his ex to see him single. And honestly? It was just the perfect fake dating setup, let\u2019s be real. \n\n\u201cThe problem with lying about relationships is that humans are fickle, fickle creatures.\u201d\n\nAnd I truly believe the banter in this book is the best that these authors have ever crafted. It\u2019s smart, witty, and truly hilarious. I also just loved Olive and Ethan as characters so much, and I easily shipped them together; maybe harder than any Christina Lauren characters. The setting was perfect, the plot was genius, and this was just an overall really easy book to escape into and love. But I am very curious to see how plus-sized reviewers are going to feel about the representation in this book. This is not my lane, so please know that while reading this paragraph, but this book puts a huge emphasis on how Olive thinks Ethan fat-shamed and body-shamed her. She constantly talks about her body, her curves, her stress baking and eating, and how things look on her body, and even tears clothing that\u2019s too small for her, while always kind of comparing herself to her thin twin sister. Like, I was 100% sure Olive was plus-sized through the entire start of this book, but then, once they arrive in Hawaii, it seems like the only big and curvy thing about her is her breasts, which are obviously perfect! And then, at the end of this book it starts feeling like she and her thin sister are identical in bodies, too, and she also gets compared to Selena Gomez. Like, I just didn\u2019t understand. It was like they wanted to have a plus-sized main character, but they didn\u2019t want to actually go there or hire any beta readers. Like, again, this isn\u2019t my lane, and I\u2019m obviously not saying that thin people can\u2019t have body dysmorphia or just have unhealthy relationships with food and their bodies, but the way this read personally felt bad to me. I just honestly think this book could be really triggering because of the emphasis it has on Oliva\u2019s relationship with food and her inner monologue about her thoughts about her body, while also painting a very hazy picture of her actual body.Also, there is a very small conversation between Olive\u2019s family members questioning if a family member is queer, and\u2026 it was really badly done. \"Because lesbians use those strap-on things\" and apparently have short haircuts. And I completely understand it was supposed to be funny because older generations \u201cdon\u2019t get it\u201d or whatever, but it wasn\u2019t cute; it was offensive and poorly done. And the mom saying she wishes she was born a lesbian, like\u2026 gag me with any spoon you can find. Like, it was so minuscule, and I have no idea why it was even part of the book or why editors thought it was a good thing to keep included, but it just made me side eye and put a bad taste in my mouth. Okay, I know those last two paragraphs seem bad, and they are, I\u2019m not making light of them whatsoever! But I will say that if you took those two elements out, this is a really good book. Like, the best I\u2019ve read from Christina Lauren in years. It was laugh out loud funny, it was romantic and swoon worthy, and I really shipped this enemies to lovers dynamic. I never wanted to leave Olive, Ethan, or Hawaii, and I think this is just going to be the ultimate beach read of 2019.

The Unhoneymooners is not my favorite of the dynamic duo\u2019s rom-coms. Truth be told, this is the only Christina Lauren to date that has earned less than four stars from this reader. And believe me, as someone who\u2019s been a longtime fan of their work, it would be so much easier to gloss over the things that bothered me, as opposed to confessing this didn\u2019t work for me in its entirety, but it is what it is. So, hear me out. Or not. Your choice.Was the journey fun and light? For sure.Were the coauthors successful in pulling out the laughs? You bet.Even more importantly, were there swoon-worthy moments capable of rousing my inner giddy and giggly gal? Of course.Was it up to snuff with some of the duo's other novels? Nope.This time around, Christina Lauren brings readers to the Twin Cities for a wedding paid for entirely with sweepstakes and giveaways wins. In hindsight, maybe partaking in a free seafood buffet isn\u2019t the best idea. Food poisoning, anyone? How about everyone? Well, except for the two people who opted for the chicken plate instead. When optimistic Ami and her new groom find they can\u2019t peel themselves off the bathroom floor, let alone think about heading to Maui for their all expenses paid honeymoon, they enlist their siblings to take their places\u2014aka the pessimistic twin sister Olive and her \u201cnemesis\u201d Ethan. While there are some hilarious one-liners and dialogue\u2014total laugh out loud moments\u2014exchanged between the \u201cenemies\u201d, it takes reading half of the novel (around 200 pages) before anything couply transpires between Olive and Ethan. In the meantime, readers are fed a steady diet of faux hatred and convenient situations. Running into one person you know from home, okay I\u2019ll bite. Maybe I\u2019ll even refrain from rolling my eyes. But two, when you\u2019re an eleven-hour flight away on a tropical island? Come on ladies, dig a little deeper next time. There were so many other ways the situations and feelings inspired by those \u201cchance encounters\u201d could have been introduced into the storyline. Just saying.With the epilogue being the exception, the entirety of the story is told from Olive\u2019s perspective, which is a bit of departure for the duo (Roomies being the only other, I think?) and kind of a downer. Even more so considering the co-authors attempted to sell this whole \u201cnemesis\u201d idea. Seeing their rivaling thoughts firsthand would have fed into the fun. Instead, readers are privy only to Olive\u2019s thoughts, while facial expressions and dialogue have to suffice for Ethan. The perfect breeding ground for misinterpretations and assumptions. And the borderline simplistic idea\u2014by some standards\u2014that the crux of the entire novel relies on. In some respects, this enemies-to-lovers storyline presents as disjointed and weak. The pacing itself is consistently inconsistent. Slow to progress at points, yet too much all at once in others. It screamed for more storyline development and actions driven by emotion, as opposed to enlisting those things simply to get the characters where they needed to be for things to \"work\".When Olive and Ethan return home, after ten days in paradise, there are a host of issues for the pessimist to contend with: finding a career that feeds her passion, realigning her outlook on life, appreciation for her family and a desire for love. The authors utilize Olive and Ami\u2019s large extended family here, but there are no standout moments that hit home or provide any emotional value, instead conjuring those feelings of convenience once again. Not to mention, I imagine it would be a tad overwhelming for anyone to attempt to tackle their entire outlook on life in such a short timeframe (100-ish pages?). Look who the pessimist is now. *wink*All of that complaining aside, turning the pages was effortless. Sure, there were a few times when it felt like I was simply going through the motions, but for the most part, The Unhoneymooners was delightfully fun. Not quite special enough to knock Josh and Hazel\u2014the quirky couple who garnered hordes of fans with their infamous guide to not dating\u2014from the throne, but entertaining enough. For me, it was Olive and Ethan\u2019s perfectly imperfect ending that proved the journey worthy. Bonus points to the writing duo for offering readers a much-needed glimpse of life from Ethan\u2019s adoring eyes.*A HUGE thank you to Gallery for sending my gorgeous copy. This colorful cover and the possibility of what was to come brightened my day. The review copy in no way altered my opinions.", "never in my life have i read a book that had the same sense of humour as me - until now. this is honestly one of the funniest books i have ever read. i was giggling like a dweeb pretty much throughout the entire thing. gosh, its such a depressing thought to know i will never be as funny as olive and ethan. the charming humour aside, this might be the best execution of the enemies-to-lovers trope since \u2018the hating game.\u2019 is everything in the story convenient? sure. is it super emotionally compelling? not really. but it absolutely nails the fact that relationships dont work unless you know your partner on a friendship level. and i love the natural connection that developed between olive and ethan.my only complaint would be that the ending is a little rushed. there is a massive shift in story dynamic when olive and ethan return from their trip (almost feels like an entirely seperate story) and it just feels like it ends too soon. i think there are some things that could have been explored more and i honestly wouldnt have minded a longer book. oh well. still a fantastic story overall!\u21a0 4.5 stars", "\n4.5 stars.

I finished it in one sitting, and the pages just flew by! It really does play out like a movie, and you can practically see it on the widescreen while you are reading. Completely a feel good book with all the fluffy romance and sexy tidbits you'd want in one. _______________\nThe Story\nThe Unhoneymooners follows Olive Torres during a honeymoon that she goes on falsely identifying as her twin sister Ami, who just got married. After a bad case of food poisoning at Ami's wedding, the only two unaffected people are Olive and Ami's husbands brother, Ethan. Ethan and Olive have supposedly hated each other from the moment they met each other, so they both agree to disagree and go on the honeymoon together. What starts as a fake marriage and an excuse for a free holiday soon turns into many misadventures, misencounters and misunderstandings. Soon, Olive and Ethan start to realize that they have immense chemistry between them and maybe they were wrong from the start... Firstly, I want to call it and say that the enemies to lovers trope is going to swoop 2019 away from me like a storm. There is honestly very little that can go wrong with the trope and this book was evidently showed how electric it can be. It truly was such an easy and fast-paced read that had little bouts of sexual tension that made it unputdownable. This was really hard to rate for me. Without giving too much away, the first 65% of the book felt like a 4 -5 star read, full with funny and lovable characters that all had their own charm. However, after that mark something felt so unbalanced and I disliked the way some issues were dealt with alongside some dynamics. Yes, it was unrealistic and the story arcs that were created have been done before, but that still did not take away from how effortless it felt to sink into Olive and Ethan's story. I'm glad the story had no obvious insta-love aspects but during the last quarter there were some cringey lines that felt uncomfortably close. \nThe Romance\nAll this book really left me with was a strong desire to go pick up more Christina Lauren books. Not very many romance contemporaries can do that for me, so that was really refreshing. The romance between Olive and Ethan was electric, it sparked and flew off the page. I could feel their hate but I could also feel how slowly they dissolved into each others company. I really enjoyed that Olive is a strong woman that learns her self-worth and sticks up for her curves throughout the story. So all in all the romance was charming. Once the book neared the second half, I could feel my rating drop slightly. I was initially going to give this 4 stars but knew that wouldnt be true to what I thought of the story as a whole. During the end, I started being very cautious about the way that Olive and Ethan solved their problems. With no spoilers, they didn't really solve their problems. Then when a couple chapters passed, there was a massive reveal that I felt needed a bigger reaction from Ethan. With that being said, I loved the family dynamic and the friendship involved with Olive and her relatives. It didn't feel like it was a filler, it felt like it belonged and made the story all the more delightful. But still, I need more girls to stand up for girls this 2019. I really enjoyed this story and definitely will read more of the authors' works.", "\"When I signed up for this honeymoon, I had no idea it would involve so much nudity.\"Raise your glass to another winner from Christina Lauren! *clink* This writing duo features my go-to gals when it comes to romantic comedies. Seriously, I can't remember the last time an author consistently made me chortle so hard or forced me to sustain multiple gut busters in a row. Last time I checked, we could all use a few more good vibes all over the world, and if you're looking for another feel good time, this is your stop. Get off the TBR bus right now; hurry or you'll miss it!I immediately connected with Olive and her plight to fight the system that forces prejudice against the curvy girl. Seriously, a female lead who not only inhales cheese curds at the fair and makes no apologies for it, but also holds anyone accountable who tries to fat shame her? This girl is my hero. Olive and Ethan are the \"unlikeliest couple\" ever, which means of course they have to get together, because this is my all time favorite trope. Let's give a standing ovation for the enemies-to-lovers plot! Ethan is a seemingly OCD/stuffy know-it-all, who honestly came off as a standard dick in the beginning. But Chelsea, isn't there some underlying reason why he's coming across as such a shallow turd muncher you ask? Obviously, but we'll get there in due time. This pair contains the only two people at Olive's sister's wedding who didn't come down with an unfortunate, fancy case of food poisoning. Sister Amy insists that Olive take the non-refundable, all inclusive honeymoon to Hawaii, while brother Dane insists that Ethan takes it. Even though Olive and Ethan despise each other, they are both stubborn as an ox and refuse to let the other have all the fun, so they agree to commit fraud and enjoy a free vacation while spending as little time as possible around each other. We all know how this story goes, and I think one of the reasons I pick up these books is for the familiarity and predictability they provide. Even if everything in my life is going haywire, I can count on these two people going through the motions to hit me right in the feels where I need it most. I'm sure you can guess how 99% of this book will turn out, but what I can't emphasize enough is just how laugh-out-loud hilarious it was journeying alongside of Ethan and Olive. The shower changing scene, anyone? While the plot seemed a little less zany and more believable than Josh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating, I felt the snappy dialogue and witty humor was most on point with that previous story than some of their others. *side note, you can say it's unbelievable that twins would end up dating or marrying brothers, but I had a ballet teacher who married her identical twin's brother in law. Hope your marriage is still going strong Miss Jamie, and if not, I apologize for bringing it up here.*The reason I went with a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating is a bit complex, and I'll try to unpack it below, complete with spoiler tags. While I understand that this is fiction, I felt conflicted about how the book ended. Once Olive and Ethan return from the \"honeymoon\" and insert themselves into real life mode, they have some issues that they have to deal with involving family members on both sides. On the one hand, I love how we see Olive grow as a person, taking ownership for her shortcomings and choices in life, and becoming ok with who she is and finding who she wants to be in her professional career. This portion felt deeper than in previous \"fluffy\" novels, which perhaps raised my expectations on how the ending would handle her and Ethan's \"disagreement\". (view spoiler)[After everything Olive goes through in trying to start a discussion involving Dane's unacceptable behavior, I was really disappointed that, after Ethan was such an ass LITERALLY until the last possible second, how quickly Olive took him back and how little everyone seemed to think the way he acted was ok. For me, his behavior was the last in a major list of red flags, and I think an ending on par with CoHo's \"It Ends With Us\" where each character finds themselves without getting back together would have been more effective. (hide spoiler)] Obviously, this is just personal preference, and a small blot in an otherwise delicious, steamy, feel good romp. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a good laugh and a story you can fly through in record time. *I received a review copy via the publisher.", "4.5 stars - I stayed up later than was probably wise reading this and I have no regrets (yet.. ask me in the morning). Enemies to lovers. Fake dating. Misunderstanding that isn\u2019t completely irrational. Bickering couple. Protagonist that\u2019s a bit bitter but trying her best. Thanks I love it. ", "So, I just reread this book and it was just as great the second time and I noticed more things that I love about it. Yes, I read this book twice within one year and yes it still makes me smile and giggle and feel all the warm fuzzies. I adore Olive and Ethan so much and I'm a huge fan of the trope when a pessimistic person gets paired with an optimist, and I think I love this book especially because Olive is more of a pessimist, realist personality whereas Ethan is the optimist. I feel like it's so rare in romance novels to see the female being the more negative one because usually the females are always trying to make the males more optimistic but in this book it's really opposite, which is why I relate to Olive so much because I tend to be such a pessimist myself so I just really relate to her character, and her close relationship with her twin sister is also something I strongly relate to. I just adore this book so hard and I think it's something I want to reread every now and then because it makes me so damn happy. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Holy shit I loved this so much. Christina Lauren is one of my favorite authors and I was absolutely STOKED when Gallery Books sent me an ARC of their latest romance The Unhoneymooners. I think I honestly have a new favorite from them. This one or Autoboyography is my favorite book from this author now, ahhh.This is an adorable rom-com that follows this girl named Olive who is chronically unlucky, and her twin sister Ami who is absurdly lucky. Ami is marrying this guy named Dane and Olive can't stand Dane's brother Ethan. At Ami and Dane's wedding, the entire wedding party gets food poisoning except for Olive and Ethan who didn't eat the fish, so Ami tells Olive to take her nonrefundable honeymoon trip to Hawaii and Dane tells his brother Ethan to take the trip: so Ethan and Olive take the trip to Hawaii together. This romance has a lot of my favorite romance tropes: hate to love, slow burn romance, fake dating/fake marriage, it really has it all. I am absolute trash for the fake dating trope I just love it so much and this book does it sooooo well.It's been along time since a romance novel has made me so giddy. I just adore the hell out of Olive and Ethan both, and this book reminded me of one of my all time favorite romances: The Hating Game because their banter is so on point. Like for real, this is one of the funniest fucking books I've ever read, I giggled out loud many times, and I devoured this story is two sittings. I could not put it down. Their chemistry is so contagious, I was grinning form ear to ear the entire time I was reading this. This story would make for the perfect rom-com beachy movie. I could picture it all in my head so vividly.I love Olive's mexican family which reminded me so much of my own. I love her relationship with her twin sister Ami, they were totally adorbs. I also loved how her parents have been separated for so long but never divorced, and her gay cousin Diego. The closeness of their family and the way they supported each other through everything just reminded me so much of my own family and it was just really sweet. Also, Olive's unlucky streak was entertaining as hell and she has some really great stories about unlucky things that have happened to her I was cackling. I tend to be more of a pessimistic person too like Olive so I found her general attitude towards life really relatable. Ethan is my favorite kind of male love interest: he's strong but soft and he seems so rough around the edges but once you get to know him he's a total softy, and he's a cute drunk and he wants to see the best in people and he respects women and he's crazy passionate about his nerdy job and I just adored the shit out of him. I just loved this so so so so much. I've found a new all time favorite romance/OTP/book. I just want to run around recommending this book to everyone and I want to reread it immediately upon finishing it which is always a good sign. Don't skip this one in May!Book 1 of the Contemporary-a-thon is complete!", "Here are two true statements about me:1) While I have never actually liked a Christina Lauren book, I really want to, and I keep trying to.2) I love The Hating Game.Here is a statement about this book I believe to be true:1) It is just a worse The Hating Game.To be fair, most Christina Lauren books are just a worse The Hating Game. (In my opinion, that is. Because for reasons unknown I love The Hating Game.)I mean. Here, we have Olive, the adorkable, cringey heroine who Doesn\u2019t Know She Is Beautiful But Does Know She Is Physically Sexy (because that\u2019s definitely different from a woman being valued only for sexual purposes). She\u2019s paired with Ethan, the cold and mean (but so hot and omg his ABS) guy who is actually sooooo nice once you get to know him and all those times he was a total asshole? Just a misunderstanding. Well I mean it staaaarted a misunderstanding, but then the girl was like, so mean to him (and also so sexy, he was distracted by her boobs / butt / legs can you blame him), so then he just HAD to be a mean vengeful child about it for literally years on end!Essentially The Hating Game.And I have to tell you, I\u2019m getting realllllll sick of this trope. It\u2019s just childish bickering teeming with misunderstandings then sexy time then a major misunderstanding then make-up sexy time and finally, mercifully, The End.I like The Hating Game, though, because it\u2019s charming and I found the romance believable. Not only was I not charmed by this book, not only did I not find the romance believable, but...well.Let\u2019s do a list.1) The Huge Misunderstanding That Threatens To Ruin Everything Even True Love is very, very stupid. Putting this point in spoiler tags: (view spoiler)[Our protagonist, Olive, has a twin, Ami, who is married to Ethan\u2019s brother, whose name I couldn\u2019t remember if you paid me. I had to look up everyone else\u2019s names in the synopsis. Anyway, Ethan\u2019s brother - let\u2019s call him Stupid Jock With No Traits Who Doesn\u2019t Matter, Jock for short - comes onto Olive in a super creepy way, and when she tells Ami and Ethan about it, they both accuse her of lying. In spite of the fact that, supposedly, they both love her in respective once-in-a-lifetime level bonds. There is literally no reason for them to think she\u2019s lying and to believe Jock, who is sh*tty and gross, but they do. Because drama. (hide spoiler)]2) There\u2019s such a halfhearted subplot for Olive about her needing a DREAM CAREER. One of the first things we learn about her (after the first round of the countless descriptions of her sexy curvy body) is that she genuinely enjoys her career path and is good at it. But for some reason...that is not a dream career? Am I an emotionless robot for not understanding that? The rest of the book is teeming with Motivational Passages from Ethan and Olive\u2019s internal monologue about her Not Settling and Finding Herself and I just...don\u2019t get it.3) The way the world works in this book feels completely unfamiliar to me. Like, Olive\u2019s twin Ami pays for her entire wedding - venue, food, dress, hotel, honeymoon, everything - with...coupons? What? That\u2019s not a thing. Olive gets fired for a reason solely related to her personal life, which makes no sense. Everyone believes there\u2019s such a thing as a definitively good or bad luck? What. Where are we. What\u2019s going on.But worst of all...I didn\u2019t care about this at all. Where was the CHEMISTRY. Where was the CHARM. Where was the part where I FALL in LOVE and also they FALL in LOVE.Why am I reading a rom-com and feeling neither ROM nor COM.Bottom line: Will I keep reading Christina Lauren books? Who\u2019s to say. (Probably.) (But then, that\u2019s the masochism talking.)----------CALLED ITreview to come / 2.5ish stars----------i am probably not going to like this book but by god i won't let that stop me", "\nLoved this sexy, sweet and snarky book! It's the perfect escape read! \ud83d\ude0d\n Admittedly I'm a Christina Lauren fan! I'd been looking forward to this book with its Hispanic representation and it didn't disappoint. Curvy women, laugh out loud hilarious family members and the amazing, never let you down extended family that is as close (if not closer) as the one living under your roof. It reminded me so much of my family growing up - everyone knowing each other's business, constantly making fun of each other and above all else, having each other's back no matter what! It took me a bit to get into the book initially which surprised me. I wasn't as into the first part detailing the wedding. Olive's twin sister Ami is getting married and everything is supposed to be perfect. Ami seems to have it all - perfect luck, perfect life, perfect love. Olive on the other hand seems to have the worst luck - she lost her job, her roommate and her apartment. Things start to look up for Olive (and me as the reader!) when she and the best man, Ethan are the only two guests left standing after food poisoning ravages everyone at the wedding. Ami persuades her sister to go on her free honeymoon to Hawaii, so that the prize doesn't go to waste. The groom makes the same offer to his best man and brother, Ethan. Only problem is - Ethan and Olive hate each other. \nIs an all exclusive, all expenses paid trip to Hawaii worth spending 10 days with someone you utterly despise?\n With these two - count me in!I adored the constant back and forth banter between Olive and Ethan. They were hilarious and the underlying sexual tension was palpable. I laughed out loud, smiled so much my cheeks hurt and was left feeling all bubbly inside as I went through the pages of this book. In short, Christina Lauren have done it again - all hail my rom-com queens! \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc51 \u2764\ufe0fThank you to the duo known as Christina Lauren, Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review an arc of this book.", "\n3.5 stars Fun Escape! \nWhen all but two weddings guests contract food poisoning at a wedding in Minnesota, they help out the bride and groom by going on their honeymoon for them. It just so happens that the two guests are the bride's twin sister, Ollie, and the groom\u2019s brother, Ethan. Of course, Ollie and Ethan hate each other. Of course, both are extremely attractive people. Of course, under all of the hatred they really do like each other. When forced to share a hotel room for 10 days, the inevitable happens: they fall in love. But there are complications that threaten to tear them apart. While the romance between Ethan and Ollie plays a large role, this book is really more about Ollie learning to embrace life and stop focusing on the bad. She is smart, bristly and extremely protective of both herself and her sister. She feels like she attracts bad luck and as a resultdoesn't trust when good things happen to her. She undergoes quite the transformation, which was nice to read! The Unhoneymooners checks off all of the boxes I have come to expect from Christina Lauren books: A plucky protagonist, fun quirky plot, hot sexual tension, and of course, plenty of romance. This wasn\u2019t my favorite CL novel but it did the job! It felt a little safe and formulaic-- I like when CL pushes the boundaries and goes in an unexpected direction, but I still found The Unhoneymooners a satisfying read! I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books in exchange for an honest review.", "Ah. The classic enemies-to-lovers trope. AKA --\u203a my Achilles heel. Christina Lauren's standalone rom/coms have just been improving. I always know I'm going to love it, that I'm going to adore these characters. That they're going to make me laugh and probably make me cry. This was no exception. Olive has always had shitty luck. But when all the guest at her twin sister's wedding end up horribly sick with food poisoning, for once Olive is the lucky one. With the bride and groom sick and none refundable honeymoon tickets, Olive and the grooms brother Ethan, the only other person not affected by the food poisoning, are tasked with enjoying the free vacation. The only problem is that she and Ethan do not get along. At. All. They plan to stay far away from eachother and enjoy their time in Hawaii separately, but that's put to the test when all the activities booked for them are for a couple on honeymoon. Throw in the unexpected pop-up of a new boss and an ex when you're supposed to be pretending to be recently married, and what you have is a shit storm. I really love the fake relationship trope. It's always a winner (okay not always but most of the time).This book reminded me a lot of The Hating Game by Sally Thorne (I recommend that book wholeheartedly). And Ethan reminded me a lot of the MC of THG, Joshua Templeman (can I get whoop whoop \ud83d\ude4c). The chemistry between Olive and Ethan was off the charts and their banter was top notch \ud83d\udc4c. I came to really care about them and the character growth was also really beautiful to read .I could really see this book as a movie. It was charming and addictive and I didn't want to blink while reading. ARC received in exchange for an honest review.______16 January, 2019YASS GIMME THAT ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS TROPE", "4.5 stars, rounded up.So there I was, feeling a bit of withdrawal since it had been more than two months since I'd read a Christina Lauren book (I read four of their books in 2018, and one in 2017). Then, like a bolt out of the blue, I saw that NetGalley was offering advance copies of their newest book, \nThe Unhoneymooners\n, and I literally pulled my car over into the first parking lot I saw and submitted my request. (True story. And I kept to my no NetGalley requests while driving rule.)Of course, I was granted access to the title, and one day later? I devoured the book and will (kind of) patiently wait for their next one. (A long, long time ago I went to a book signing of John Grisham's for \nThe Pelican Brief\n. I told him how much I liked the book and he said, \"Man, Larry, I just finished this one. Slow down!\") But once again, Christina Lauren doesn't disappoint, but gives me all the feels and leaves me giddy.Olive and Ami are identical twins. As far as Olive is concerned, Ami has always been the lucky one, while Olive has recently been laid off from her job and had to move back in with her family when her roommate moved out. Plus, Olive's biggest achievement is getting stuck in an arcade claw machine when she was younger.Ami is also lucky in love\u2014she's about to marry Dane, who may be a little too frat bro-y for Olive's taste, but Olive is happy that her sister is happy. Ami has been able to put on her entire wedding and reception through contests and drawings (which explains the ridiculous, Skittle-green bridesmaid's dresses), but she's given Olive a number of tasks on the big day, most of which include interacting with Ethan, Dane's older brother\u2014and Olive's nemesis since their first meeting took an ugly turn a few years ago.\"Too tall, too fit, too classically pretty. Never friendly, never trustworthy, never any fun. He puts on an innocent smile\u2014innocent on the surface: a flash of teeth, a dimple, but in his eyes, it's all black-souled.\"When Ethan and Olive are virtually the only two people not to contract food poisoning at the reception, Ami and Dane have a free honeymoon in Maui that is use-it-or-lose-it. Olive is certainly not going to let Ethan enjoy Maui by himself, so she agrees to go. They both figure there will be plenty of opportunities to enjoy the beautiful scenery\u2014and lose the other. But when they realize they'll need to pretend to be giddy honeymooners for 10 days, it seems like a small price to pay for paradise, right?When unexpected encounters with people from both of their lives force them to tear into their acting roles with greater passion, Olive starts to realize that she doesn't mind spending time with Ethan and pretending to be married to him. Maybe he's not as bad as she thought he was\u2014and maybe she can't get enough of being with him. But what is real and what is an act? What will happen when they leave paradise and go home to Minnesota? Will they fall back into their antagonistic relationship?The thing about Christina Lauren's books (other than terrific characters you root for, great emotions, humor, and hot sex) is that even though you probably can predict most of what will happen, you get so hooked on the story, and you're so charmed by it, that it doesn't really matter. Their books get me every time\u2014like I said earlier, I get a little giddy, a little emotional, and I just want more.If you're a fan of rom-coms, or just want a lighter book to divert you from brooding thrillers, Christina Lauren's books are just the ticket. Their book \nLove and Other Words\n made my list of the best books I read last year, while \nRoomies, My Favorite Half-Night Stand\n, and \nJosh and Hazel's Guide to Not Dating\n were not far behind. (Plus, \nAutoboyography\n, one of their few YA books, is utterly AMAZING.)NetGalley and Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

Thank you for having me tonight. Can you all hear me alright? Great.Me: *pulls out a copy of The Unhoneymooners* Tonight, we will be reading the entirety of the Unhoneymooners. No, don't leave. I see you in the back row. Don't try to leave. The doors have already been locked. You will sit in this room until you hear every single glorious word.Me: *Eye twitches*Me: Every. Single. Word.Okay, maybe I wouldn't actually do that (yes, i would) but I would do anything (legal) to show and share my love for this book. I don't know how I will be able to write this review. It's simply not possible to put such strong emotion into words. \nSo, what's this book about?\nAmi and Dane are getting married. Unfortunately, at the wedding party, almost everyone gets sick with food poisoning. Almost everyone. Ethan and Olive are the only ones affected by this sickness. Obviously, Ami and Dane can't go on their honeymoon but the honeymoon, which was won as part of a raffle isn't refundable and the dates are firmly fixed. Ami doesn't want the prize to go to waste and so she asks Ami to go in her place. Dane asks Ethan to go in his place. Unfortunately, Ethan and Olive hate each other. But both of them don't want to upset there siblings and so they agree to go. For the whole honeymoon, they both have to pretend to be married. Hijinks ensue and it's funny, sexy and a f*cking great time.Characters\u2660 Olive - Olive is a cynic. She hates everyone. Okay, not everyone. She is one of those people that puts up a shield, constantly pushing people away. It's not because she is rude but because she is afraid. She is afraid to open herself up to others because she doesn't want to get hurt. I totally understand because I am like that too. Over the past year, I have pushed all my friends away because I am afraid that they will hurt my like my therapist. (F*ck you, Ms. E***)\u2660 Ethan - HOLLLYYY SH****TTT. Forget Henry from Red, White and Royal Blue. Ethan is my new senpai. I mean he's hot, funny and when you get to know him, open and emotional. Fdjgjsfjujsasgs. That's everything I want in a man! Bye, Henry.\u2660 Ami - At first, Ami is just that b*tch. That b*tch that is pretty and popular and good at every single g*dd*mn thing. I mean towards the end things get better with her but as a person I give her three stars. She is right smack-dab in the middle of the good person meter. Sorry, Ami.\u2660 Dane - F**K THAT M*TH*RF**K*NG P**C* *F M*TH*RF**K*NG SH*T. I HATE HIMSO G*DD*MN MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Anyway, now that I'm done ranting about the above mentioned sh*t, we can move on to my favorite part of this book: The Romance! This is a romance. Obviously. I have said it before and I will say it again. I am not a huge fan of romance. Mainly because it's usually cheesy and poorly done. Maybe it's because of hormones or medication or some other bodily sh*t but lately I have just been a teary emotional mess and so romance is right up my alley. Fortunately, my 350+ book collection has a ton of romance. That said, I am so glad that out of the many romances on my shelves that I picked this one. It was so well done and funny. Enemies-to-lovers romance is my favorite kind. It shows that change is possible. It shows that even the worst relationships can evolve into something greater. Something more beautiful. Like when an ugly caterpillar goes into its cocoon and comes out as a colorful butterfly. Afterall, we do change each other. Even in a non-romantic relationship, us humans change each other, shape each other and build each other up. Romance is so much more than kisses. It's about love and connection.Now, there is a reason this is called a rom-com. I can't remember the last time that a book legitimately made me giggle out loud, let alone actually laugh. This book was so blunt and honest. The wording and timing was perfect. There was so much stuff said and done that you don't usually see in a book yet somehow fit perfectly and made the book so much more enjoyable. That combined with the fact that Ethan and Ami were wrapped in a web of their own lies and their hatred for each other. Oh, it was absolute perfection!Overall, a hilarious rom-com that I highly recommend. It will keep you laughing or crying or maybe even both.Bottom Line:5 StarsAge Rating [ R ]TW: Mild Sexual HarassmentCover: 4/5 ~ Characters: 5/5 ~ Plot: 5/5 ~ Audio: 4/5| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram", "Oh, this was just downright charming!

When everyone falls sick after the wedding from eating shellfish, everyone except Olive and Ethan, Ami's new husband's brother. Olive and Ethan don't like each other but in the interest of getting free shit they decide to pretend to be married to go on Ami and Dane's honeymoon. The premise was fun and even if it was slightly ridiculous, I enjoyed it. The first 50% is essentially just Olive and Ethan getting to know eachother better, sorting out some misunderstandings between them and pretending to be married. Some truly ridiculous shit happens (Ethan's ex AND Olive's new boss both happen to be there) and while it was unrealistic, I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I guess where this book falls apart is I didn't get the CHEMISTRY. these two people are way too horny for their own good, and all they really do is make horny jokes and their entire relationship is based off of Ethan thinking Olive has good titties and Olive thinking Ethan has good abs. And it's not that I can't necessarily get behind that, but I did find it boring here. I felt I was reading it like 'yep, that sure is another paragraph about how he's hot' but there was no spark or real connection that made me feel anything about it. I also found a lot of their banter cringey and their characterisation was so predictable (she's an awkward klutz who says silly things before thinking, he's a stoic brooding type with a heart of gold ect)That said, the majority of the first half was fun and silly and I liked the progression of their relationship and the things they had to do to avoid getting caught out as not being married. And the massage scene did kind of slap. The second half, however .... this is where my rating dropped from a \"it's not great but it's a three star because I'm liking it\" to a \"god, I liked it at first but can it end already\" two stars. It's hard to talk about the second half without spoiling everything but lets just say it was non-stop heterosexual nonsense, misunderstandings, and people Doing Bad Things that shouldn't have been forgiven as easily as they were. There was also some frankly questionable choices made regarding representation, like the plus-sized rep really only there when it was convenient for the plot, and the queer rep ..... well the stereotypical gay side character and the discussion about lesbians ....... yikes. It was unnecessary and made me wince. The final grand gesture scene was also so cringe-worth I had that visceral second-hand embarrassment reaction and I DON'T enjoy feeling that way. \n\u201cThe problem with lying about relationships is that humans are fickle, fickle creatures.\u201d\nspecial mention to the part where the MC makes a harry potter joke and the LI replies with a harry potter joke and the MC is like \"omg ... I knew he liked reading but he likes THE SAME BOOKS AS ME ........... the perfection of this man\" like first of all calm down everyone knows harry potter Ethan isn't indie he isn't special .. you're living in america everyone understands harry potter references. second of all since when is 'harry potter' a type of book like skfksk. this shit made me roll my eyes so hard. So there we go: I didn't really love reading this super hyped romance book and its like a 2.5 star for me purely because I Did genuinely have fun with the beginning to the middle even if it was ridiculous. Do I dislike romance in general, is this a bad book, are horny straight people annoying, or am I just so tired of hetero people writing books about hetero nonsense? chime off in the comments", " My thoughts in a nutshell The Unhoneymooners is all around Booktube. Everyone is reading it and love it. I was curious,  is it worth the hype? My short answer is no. The story is about\u2026Skip over this point if you don't like the sneak peek. Ami and Dane are getting married. At the wedding, every guest gets indigestion, including the bride and the groom. They can't go on a honeymoon, but the travel isn't refundable. Finally, Ami's twin sister Olive and Dane's brother Ethen take the nonrefundable honeymoon trip to Hawaii. They hate each other and the problems just accumulate. What impressed me This book is a perfect summer choice. Incredibly light, very easy to read. Just look at the cover, it's so summery.I liked the whole plot. Everyone knows what will happen in the end, but it is still enjoyable.The characters were likable, but there's nothing extra. Every contemporary, chick-lit book are the same. You know these characters, in here they have a different name and lived in a different place. It's totally okay, and I adore this type of novels.The writing style was refreshing. It is my first read by the duo but definitely not the last.The little 'twist' was great, I loved the solution what Ami made. The ending was kinda cute, exactly as I imagined.What I don't like The hate to love trope was fast for me. I think there was too much coincidence. It was a bit forced. I wanted more funny scenes. I thought I would laugh more, but no, I didn't even smile. Make a conclusion Overall. It is a pretty decent read. I don't agree with the hype, but I still recommend it because it is fun. I gave it 3 stars.

Christina Lauren can do no wrong! This was another homerun from this amazing writing duel. Olive\u2019s twin sister Amy is getting married. The wedding goes off without a hitch and it should because Amy has given Olive a to do list over 75 items long. BUT The perfect day is hijacked by the seafood buffet that makes every single guest sick, with the exception of Olive and Ethan the groom\u2019s brother. Bride Amy is sick as can be, but does not want her honeymoon to go to waste, so she convinces her sister to take her place. The problem Olive\u2019s plus one will be Ethan and the two of them have never got along. Well that might be putting it mildly the two pretty much can\u2019t stand the sight of one another. BUT how can Olive resist 10 days in Maui? Loved this book from cover to cover. The sun. The sand. The sexual tension. Olive was a fabulous character smart, snarky, and sassy. Enemies to lovers is one of my absolute favorite tropes and I loved how it played out in this story. The banter between Olive and Ethan was perfection. The story is told from Olive\u2019s perspective. I generally like getting the mail POV as well in romances, but I thought this was really impactful in this book. We got to know Ethan as Olive did. Ethan was a great guy and I think I might have fallen in love with him right along with Olive. There are a few times during this book he said the absolute right thing at the perfect time. I said awww out loud a few times. I also found myself laughing out loud quite a bit. I love humor in my romances. BUT this book add a bit of a more serious side in parts. I thought this balance everything out well and I loved the resolution to the issues in this book. There was one part of this book that had me standing up cheering! You\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about if you have read this book! If you are a Christina Lauren fan you will love this book! If you have not read them yet, what are you waiting for? This was a romcom done perfectly. The perfect blend of sass, Snark, swoon, and sizzle. A cast of engaging well developd characters and I really loved how important family was in this book. Well I\u2019ve said a lot, I could go on anon, but I won\u2019t, I will spare you all! Just read it! it\u2019s fantastic!\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa7 Cynthia Farrell did an amazing job with her audiobook narration. She gave a perfect voice to both Olive and Ethan. I want to give her big props on her male voices. Deacon Lee came in and narrated the epilogue, he\u2019s one of my favorites so of course I think he did a fab job!*** Big thanks to Gallery and Simon & Schuster Audio for my copy of this book ***", "5 Sweet, Endearing, Laugh-out-Loud Stars!Christina Lauren: You Make Me Smile! Are you in the mood for a book that will make your heart soar and will have you laughing almost from the get go? One that will have you breaking into a smile with all of the humorous sarcastic back and forth comments, but won\u2019t make you \u201ccover your eyes?\u201d (lol). If so, \u201cThe Unhoneymooners\u201d by Christina Lauren is for you! I thought it was Pure Perfection! Olive and Ami are identical twins. Ami is about to get married to Dane and has planned everything to the T. The best part of course is that Ami has gotten everything for free - she wins internet contests and is simply lucky in life. Olive however is extremely unlucky. Bad things happen to her constantly - she\u2019s like a magnet. Worst of all, Olive is going to have to spend her sister\u2019s wedding with Dane\u2019s older brother Ethan, who treats Olive like a bug who got stuck on the bottom of his shoe. Then it happens. Just when Olive thought she was the one with the bad luck: everyone except she and Ethan get shellfish poisoning at the wedding and she and Ethan are forced to go on the honeymoon planned for Ami and Dane. The catch? They have to pretend that they are the Honeymooners. Maybe Olive isn\u2019t so unlucky after all.Olive is a gal who has never given herself a chance. What she needed was a little push. Looks like she got one. And he\u2019s quite cute too!While I wouldn\u2019t call myself a believer, these books sure make me want to. After reading Christina Lauren and other rom coms, I break into smiles in public, laugh more often and dance alone in my kitchen. What better response is there? I can attest to the fact that my book buddy Kaceey and I laughed a lot during this one and that is the best medicine possible. So glad we read this one together Kaceey and that we have added women\u2019s fiction and rom coms to our repertoire. Thank you to NetGalley, Gallery Books and Christina Lauren for an arc of this novel in exchange for an honest review. Published on Goodreads on 2.18.19.*Will be published on Amazon and Twitter on publication date.Excerpt to be published on Instagram.", "\n\u27b3Christina Lauren have brought another romance filled with enemies to lovers type of ambiance, that will sometimes have you questioning whether Olive and Ethan are meant to be... \n\u27b3When it comes down to anything that it written by Christina, there is no denying that I will do anything to get my hands on anything written by them. Maybe it's because the novel was hyped up, and also maybe because I am not the biggest fan of enemies to lovers kind of romance, but I was not the biggest fan of this novel. Which does indeed disappoint me because I wish I could have given it a five stars review. This review in general is still positive because the story in general is one that did catch my eye and did make me laugh every so often. Olive is yet again another character that has that quirky side to her that had me connected to her as an individual. \u27b3With Ethan however... I am not sure just yet how I feel about him. Listening to his brother to get the \"best\" of him? And deny the attraction he has towards Olive? Hmmm... I guess that makes the story a little bit better, but in reality I would have punched him in the face for denying his one true love, especially with someone such as Olive. I guess this makes the overall point of view and also change of plot in the story, but I don't like there being internal denial on a character. Ethan is described as a mysterious individual but I don't see him that way. Whatever way I think of him, I will keep it to myself because I still have not been able to grasp my true opinion.\u27b3This novel overall has it's potential of love and admiration. I give full pledge honors to Olive for that, because without her latina spark I would not have been able to thoroughly enjoy this novel. Thank you so much to Gallery Books for sending this beauty over, looking forward to reading more reviews on this novel.\u27b3ARC galley kindly provided by the publisher, in exchange for an honest review...\u27b3Follow Me On:Blog \u2655 Instagram \u2655 Facebook \u2655 Twitter", "\nthis was super fun and typical christina lauren rom-com stylethe chemistry was A+ and i loved all the awkward situations the characters got themselves into.i will say there was questionable fat rep. you can't just give a character huge tits and call it a day. and there was some annoying drama added in at the end BUT overall I did really enjoy this and it reads super quick! \n", "\n\n\u201cThe problem with lying about relationships is that humans are fickle, fickle creatures.\u201d\n\nSometimes a fun & heartwarming romance novel, even one with a few problems, is exactly what I need. Honestly, this is around a 3 1/2 but I\u2019m not even going to pretend it didn't make me so exceptionally happy I might have melted my cold dead heart. This was my first dude read in a while with Chaima, and I'm so glad it was a good one. After lead character Olive\u2019s sister Ami and her fiance Dane are poisoned by shelfish, along with the rest of their wedding party, Olive is dragged into taking their tickets to a Hawaii honeymoon. There\u2019s only one problem: this involves faking a relationship with her enemy Ethan, Dane\u2019s brother. This biggest problem with the narrative of this novel is that Olive\u2019s character arc feels weak. Olive losing her job because of the lying honestly sucked to read. It really does feel like 1. an overreaction and 2. something that results directly from a stupid decision. And it goes very against the fake dating trope, to me, for someone to get fired because of their fake dating. Because her lack of love for her job is not established very seriously until late in the book, the \u201cpayoff\u201d of her career decision doesn\u2019t feel earned. Due to the structure, we also don\u2019t get a lot of insight into who Olive is outside of Ami and Ethan, so a line where Ami says she\u2019s made a lot of changes falls a bit flat. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t see where the authors are going with this arc \u2014 Olive is unsatisfied in life but doesn\u2019t fully register it yet. It\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t translate. I also feel the narrative doesn\u2019t know how to handle her being plus size, or maybe doesn\u2019t know whether she is plus size; a bunch of this book is built on a misunderstanding Olive had about Ethan\u2019s perceptions of her body, and I wanted the narrative to delve into that just a bit more The biggest complaint I have here, however, is some of the handling of the Dane storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: First of all, Dane\u2019s characterization bugged me just a tiny bit; the book sort of treats him like a subplot until the end and then makes it the main plot. The fact that Ethan doesn\u2019t immediately fucking panic upon the realization that Ami actually didn\u2019t know Dane was cheating for two years feels\u2026 honestly, out of character? Ethan is not an asshole, and he is not an idiot, and I can understand being in denial, but his on-page reaction is mostly dismissive, which is just not in character. Were Ethan\u2019s reaction to the Dane situation shifted more towards anger and denial, his character would feel both more consistent and more forgivable. But that\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t enough pros to make this feel like a worthwhile romance. It takes a lot to write really good banter and this book did it, consistently, without ever feeling cringey. I think this is honestly Christina Lauren\u2019s main talent as a writing duo and I\u2019m here for it; Ethan and Olive have such a good and fun dynamic right off the bat with just a few one-liners. The banter isn\u2019t necessarily hilarious, just really entertaining and really sweet, and I ended up pretty damn invested in these two characters getting together. Fake dating is so so entertaining and I think I\u2019ve mostly only read it in fanfiction before? (Yes, I read fanfiction, you couldn\u2019t tell that from the everything about me?) Like, honestly, it\u2019s a romance, I\u2019m living for that cheesy tense goodness. You know what I\u2019m about, son. Olive and Ami are also both biracial (Mexican and white) and the relationship between them felt really well-written and well-drawn to me. I deeply appreciated the emphasis on solidarity between women, and that though there is conflict between the sisters, they remain close, and their relationship is given deep narrative weight. Oh, um. This book has exactly one explicit sex scene, in which Ethan eats Olive out. I actually don\u2019t read a lot of m/f romance novels because I had never read a romance novel in my life till last year and also, I\u2019m gay, but cis women actually getting to orgasm and have sexual pleasure is still not very normalized and this book breaks that. Feminism! \nI can appreciate my body in a bikini and still want to set fire to the patriarchy.\nAnyway, I guess my point is that despite a few problems, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good romance novel. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "4.5 StarsThanks Gallery Books for the advanced reading copy!Another book to add to my Superior Enemies to Lovers shelf! The night I picked this up, I ended up reading 250 pages all in one sitting and staying up until 7 AM. The plot of this is SOOOO addicting and seeing Ethan and Olive's shenanigans unfold and their combative personalities play out was so entertaining and hilarious. Christina Lauren have this unmatched writing style where everything they say is fun and funny without being cheesy or unrealistic. Her characters reflect this writing style and are always so two dimensional with hilarious dialogue and such messy lives that still make you envy them and put yourself in their shoes because they end up in such unglamourous yet adorable relationships. I giggled and laughed and cried multiple times while reading this, which partially may be because I was on my period, but also it was just the perfect read for someone who loves really candid characters and witty dialogue. The ~island adventure~ part of this book, which I would have rated 5 stars, immediately got a bit glossed over for the last half of the book to be about family drama, which was still fine but clearly I prefer the angst and sexiness lol. Despite my gripe about the family drama, I really liked that Olive was Mexican, and accordingly, her big family was very present and supportive. On the note of representation, Olive was also described as being \"curvy,\" which was mentioned a couple times.The issues I had with this were all so minor and could almost be posed as just a list of personal preferences that I wish were in the book, but they still culminated enough to make me feel like this book wasn't quite a 5 star read. For it to have reached that 5-star quality, I would have liked . . . 1. Olive and Ethan's closeness to not have been spurred by a \"make my ex-girlfriend jealous when she sees us\" trope2. The conflict in the last half of the book to be spread out more evenly throughout the entire book; it seemed like the first half was fun and games and the last half was really heavy on the emotion.3. More sexiness. The only sex scene was skipped over and I'm disappointed Christina Lauren didn't deliver on the steamy side of this book.4. Ethan to not defend a shitty person? idk, I know it's supposed to be one of his character flaws, but it made him slightly less attractive.Basically, the reason I marked .5 off is because I'm selfish and I wanted this book to be the way I was expecting to be lol. Nevertheless, it still ranks up there with Josh & Hazel and Sweet Filthy Boy, which I loved! And once again, the more I read by Christina Lauren, the more I'm convinced that they can do no wrong."], "genre": ["Romance", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Chick Lit", "Adult", "Romance", "Contemporary Romance"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/65813986-the-unhoneymooners", "avg_ratings": "3.99", "ShelvedNumber": "2255"}

Wow!! This was a FANTASTIC novel. There is no way anyone could have pried this book from my hands while I was reading it. Kristin Hannah is one of my favorite authors and I am always excited when a new book is going to be released. When I found out that her new book, \u201cThe Great Alone\u201d was set in Alaska in 1974 (the year I was born); I was itching to get reading. As the book opens, we meet the Allbright family. Ernt, Cora, and their daughter, Leni. Thirteen year old, Leni is listening to her parents arguing. The terrible weather has brought out the darkness in him again. It hadn\u2019t always been like this. Before the war they were happy. When he finally came home, Leni saw nothing of the laughing and handsome man she once knew. He had nightmares and trouble sleeping. He was moody and quick to anger\u2026so very quick to anger.It\u2019s not just the Allbright family that\u2019s struggling. Morale is at an all-time low and gas prices are at an all time high. The world is in crisis. People are scared with everything that\u2019s been happening. Bombings, hijacked planes, and now college girls in Washington State have been disappearing. Danger is everywhere.  But then her dad comes home with his \u201cBig Idea\u201d smile. A friend who died in the war left him some property in Alaska. Her father is ecstatic. It\u2019s a place where they can live a decent life\u2026away from all of the madness. A simple life on land that they can live off\u2026grow their own vegetables, hunt, and be free.\n\u201cI need this, Cora. I need a place where I can breathe again. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m going to crawl out of my skin. Up there, the flashbacks and shit will stop, I know it. We need this. We can go back to the way things were before \u2018Nam screwed me up.\u201d\nHe promises he\u2019ll do better, that he\u2019ll cut down on drinking. Leni has seen this all before but she won\u2019t put up a fuss about moving again. She\u2019ll do as she\u2019s asked.\n\u201cBecause that was what love was\u201d\nThe trip to Alaska was almost like a family vacation. It was amazing and Leni was truly happy. Her dad even laughed and smiled. He was like he was \u201cBefore\u201d. However, when they arrive in Kaneq, things are different from what they imagined. There\u2019s a tiny cabin with a rotted deck, a yard full of old animal bones, and junk as far as the eye could see. No TV, no electricity, no running water. But Leni can handle all of that. She\u2019ll make the best of it, especially if it helps her Dad.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019ll be happy this time\u201d \nTwo types of people come to Alaska, people who are running to something or running away from something.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s not long before she sees things haven\u2019t changed. In fact, things seem to be getting worse.Could the darkness and the danger in her home be more treacherous than the worst Alaskan winter?Kristin Hannah has done it again! I loved this book. An entertaining and emotional read with an engrossing plot and well-developed characters. I could almost feel the bitter cold from the long isolating winters. But I could also see the beauty of Alaska with its gorgeous mountains and blue skies.Hope, love, and memory can keep you stuck. The 1970\u2019s, a time when a woman still needed a man\u2019s signature to get a credit card. The lack of understanding and assistance available. They called it \n\u201cGross Stress Reaction\u201d\n or \u201c\nBattle Fatigue\u201d\n back then\u2026 the horrible flashbacks and nightmares, the anxiety and anger, the inability to cope with regular life. Now it\u2019s called \nPTSD post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSI \u2013 post-traumatic stress injury\n. Soldiers, who gave everything to the war, then came back to a world that many of them couldn\u2019t function in, a world that didn\u2019t know how to help them heal.\u201cThe Great Alone\u201d does not disappoint. This was another fascinating, thought-provoking, and captivating read. Heartbreaking at times... but there were also moments of great love and unbelievable kindness. A gripping story where I was desperate to know what was going to happen next. A bittersweet but satisfying ending topped off this amazing read.  Thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing an advanced readers copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review.", "*3.5 stars*When it comes to emotionally compelling fiction, without a doubt, Kristin Hannah is in a league of her own. Over the years, she\u2019s taken me to the brink of hopelessness, dangled me over the edge of complete devastation and trampled my heart in the process. Where I think her magic lies is in knowing just the right moment to toss out a lifeline\u2014restoring faith, inciting love and in some cases, leaving me in complete and utter awe.Naturally, having experienced a number of her noteworthy reads, there\u2019s a certain level of expectation that now comes along with picking up one of her books\u2014unrealistic or not. Instead of tiptoeing around the elephant in the room, I\u2019m just going to get this over with and put it out there\u2014this is not my favorite of Kristin Hannah\u2019s work. Like many of her books, this is a hefty read, coming in at just under 450 pages. Where I had issues with the story\u2014the inconsistent pacing and the blatant lack of development, particularly in the back half. From a slow and purposeful narrative, to an overly dramatic and rushed ending, it\u2019s almost as if the author crammed two completely different books together.When the story opens, the Allbright family is on the brink of yet another move, this time to Alaska or The Great Alone. For Ernt, a Vietnam POW who's prone to bouts of anger, Alaska represents a fresh start and an excuse to leave behind the mess he\u2019s made of things. For 13-year-old Leni and her mother, it\u2019s a reluctant move, but one they hope will save Ernt from his demons. Luckily, the Allbrights meet a group of people who are more than willing to help them prepare for the harsh winter ahead and lend some much needed heart to a lackluster existence. What everyone soon learns, no matter how far you go, you can\u2019t outrun your demons. It\u2019s a toxic and vicious cycle they find themselves trapped in\u2014one that feels impossible at times.Kristin Hannah really takes her time laying the foundation for the Allbright family and the tedious work the Alaskan wilderness demands and you know what, that was okay with me. It was around the halfway mark, when she switched gears, that everything came crashing down. There is a love story packed within these pages, although despite the anticipation, I found it all to be sort of lackluster. The words and the feelings were present on the page, demanding my consent, but I can\u2019t say I ever truly felt their connection with every piece of my being. It's the last five chapters that take the cake for the most drama in the shortest timespan. I\u2019m not saying I take issue with what went down exactly, what I am taking issue with is the fact that Kristin Hannah bounced from one dramatic event to the next, without so much as a breath or time to process. The emphasis seemed to be on getting her characters where they needed to be in the end, rather than allowing the reader to fully appreciate Leni's journey. With all of that said, I still found this to be a worthy read. I love the thought of living a simpler life\u2014although probably not realistic for this city girl\u2014and spending a bit of time in Alaska proved to be eye-opening and even sort of refreshing.As readers, we all connect with books/characters/writing for a variety of reasons and it just so happens, this one didn\u2019t land among my favorites. Whether you\u2019re a diehard Kristin Hannah fan, like I consider myself to be, or new to her work, I urge you to give this a chance. You never know, this might be your new favorite. I also feel compelled to mention, of her books, I adored these in particular: Home Front, Night Road, Winter Garden and The Nightingale.*A HUGE thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for a copy in exchange for an honest review.", "\nAll this time, Dad had taught Leni how dangerous the outside world was. The truth was that the biggest danger of all was in her own home.\nThis book completely stole my heart. Maybe it's just more fresh in my mind, but I'm pretty sure I enjoyed The Great Alone even more than Kristin Hannah's The Nightingale. In fact, it was verging on a five-star read for me until the final few chapters-- which I felt were too rushed and more sentimental than I personally like. But I still highly recommend it.I loved the atmosphere that Hannah created. She deftly draws the wild beauty of the Alaskan landscape, painting it as the visually stunning and dangerous place it is. Set in the 1970s and 80s, this is about a family of three arriving at the last frontier in search of a different kind of life. And, boy, do they get it. The Allbrights must work themselves to the bone just to survive the perilous winter in Alaska, but we soon learn that for thirteen-year-old Leni and her mother Cora, there are dangers far greater and far closer to home than black bears and the freezing climate.\nThey were trapped, by environment and finances, but mostly by the sick, twisted love that bound her parents together.\nThe author wraps up a survival story inside a survival story. As the family grapple with raising livestock and gathering supplies for the long winter, they also must deal with the fragile, abusive dynamics that exist within their home. Ernt is a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD before anyone knew what PTSD was and this, in turn, leads to violent episodes and paranoid behaviour that threatens the safety of his family.The complexity of the characters makes this book something extra special. You hate Ernt, and yet are forced to acknowledge that he is dealing with a mental illness back when no one was willing to call it such. You feel frustrated at Cora for sticking by him, and yet she is clearly a victim of abuse. Add to this mix a set of charming secondary characters, a budding romance, snowstorms, near-death experiences and animal encounters, and you have a book that is utterly enthralling.I especially liked how the author captured the feeling of these Alaskans living in a isolated bubble of their own, being afraid of the \"Outside\" and the possibility of change. You can draw parallels between this and anyone who has ever desired to put up a wall to keep the \"Other\" out. Ernt - as well as others in their tiny town - wants to protect the community from any kind of change; from anyone who might come in and affect their way of life. It is, of course, paranoid and delusional.I could probably go on and on forever, but I'll just say I loved almost all of it. I loved how, like in The Nightingale, Hannah shows the importance and the strength of the relationships between female characters. I loved the Alaskan setting and the multiple tales of survival against the odds. And I loved how everything had something of a fairy tale quality to it, dark places and broken dreams included.\nMama had quit high school and \u201clived on love.\u201d That was how she always put it, the fairy tale. Now Leni was old enough to know that like all fairy tales, theirs was filled with thickets and dark places and broken dreams, and runaway girls.\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "Kristin Hannah wrote 70% of a novel and then 30% of a soap opera.I know this isn't likely to be a popular opinion. Hannah is an incredibly popular writer whose books sell into the millions. This might be a case of \"it's not you, it's me.\" The same problems I found in her sentinel work The Nightingale came back to haunt The Great Alone: weak female characters, use of death and tragedy as plot devises, and an overwrought, melodramatic narrative. People who liked Hannah's earlier work, will probably love this book. But if you've not been a fan in the past, don't expect much to change with this Alaskan tale.The book starts when Leni Allbright is thirteen, awkward, and unable to fit in anywhere. It doesn't help that her parents are constantly moving her around the country. Her father, Ernt, is chasing that next big opportunity that will make him happy for good. Her mother, Cora, is hoping the next town will transform Ernt into the man he was before Vietnam. The Allbright family wind up in Alaska, in a cabin without pluming and electricity and far from any real civilization. When they arrive at the start of summer, Ernt is able to relax in the natural setting, and Cora and Leni think he might really return to how he was before the war. But as the days grow colder and the sun disappears from the sky, Ernt's demons come back with a vengeance.Cora reminded me a lot of Vianne from The Nightingale, only with an abusive husband this time. Like her predecessor, she acts like a sad doormat the majority of the book until the moment she snaps out of character (view spoiler)[and murders someone (hide spoiler)]. Ernt is the usual abusive husband archetype-- drinking and beating and obsessing. One character I loved was Large Marge, who doesn't take any prisoners and doesn't suffer any fools. But I almost felt like making Marge an African-American in Alaska and obese gave her the \"excuse\" not to be yet another shrinking violet.I actually quite liked the first 70% of the book. I was rooting for Leni, I enjoyed her friendship with Matthew, the understanding boy next homestead over, and I was waiting for Ernt's dangerous end-of-the-world prepping to come to a head. This book really brings Alaska and off-grid living to life. But then it all fell apart. I feel like Hannah wanted to make her readers sad, so they would feel things, and isn't it a good book if it makes you cry? So lets kill off some characters. Heck, let's kill off all the characters! Teenage pregnancy? Sure, that's juicy stuff and very romantic. Wait, I killed off too many characters? There's a fix for that. Perfect bittersweet ending! The last hundred pages made me hate how much I enjoyed the first three hundred pages. I don't think I'll be picking up another Kristin Hannah book any time soon.I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.", "One thing is for sure, Kristin Hannah, hands down, is a talented author who can weave a tale. I have read many of her previous novels and always found them to be beautiful and thought provoking. This one, however, rubbed me the wrong way.Forewarning: This storyline deals with a lot of heavy issues, the most serious and horrific, physical abuse. I am trying my best to keep spoilers out of this review.Just so you know where my thoughts are coming from, I am the wife of a twenty-seven year military veteran, and I initially connected with this story and my heart ached for the family whose lives were changed forever due to the traumas of war, but then I became perplexed and then disturbed with where the storyline was heading, especially regarding the actions of the father, named Ernt. In a manner of speaking, I wasn\u2019t buying what was being sold. The \u201cexplanation\u201d of his actions, one in particular, which he committed over and over again, wasn\u2019t resonating with me at all.The BEFORE \u201cNam screwed him up\u201d excuse Ernt\u2019s wife invariably gave, wasn\u2019t cutting it. Numerous times the wife would say to their daughter \u201dI wish you remembered him from before.\u201d Yes, we are told Ernt was a Vietnam POW; he doesn\u2019t do well in the darkness; he suffers severely from nightmares and flashbacks. Yes, he drinks way too much. But to basically make the case his \u2018PTSD\u2019 turned him into the monster he became, did not sit well with me. It never made any sense to me why Ernt\u2019s actual thoughts were never revealed, only that his wife and daughter could see something was brewing in his eyes. He acted out in horrible ways and then apologized profusely, time and time again.As a side note - nowhere, in this author\u2019s acknowledgments at the end of the book, did she thank a psychologist/psychiatrist who deals with patients with PTSD for his or her expertise. I take that to mean she didn\u2019t seek out their input, but I could be wrong.Sorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review :(There are thousands of 4-5 star ratings for this book, and I definitely understand why. The writing is flawless, the descriptions breathtaking, and as one would expect from Kristin Hannah and as I already stated, she can weave a story like few others. I am certainly in the minority only giving 2 stars.MAYBE if I wasn\u2019t the wife of a military vet, who unfortunately saw more than his fair share of war, and maybe if I didn\u2019t relate to many of the issues Ernt was dealing with ...... maybe I would have given this a much higher rating. ", "Warning, I usually write quirky lyrical bits about a book. This is going to be more of a rant. There might be accidental spoilers so steer clear if that will bother you.Again: SPOILERS though not clear spoilers.Ok. I truly hated this formulaic flat stereotypes-everyone book. I LOVED The Nightingale. Made everyone I know read it. I thought The Nightingale hung the moon and stars. I was excited beyond words for the release of The Great Alone.The Good:The first few pages were great... Further into the book, the descriptions of the Alaskan landscape will move you and make you feel like you are standing there with the chill and snow kissing your face. The actual writing and turns of phrase are still beautiful in most places. The Bad:The book put a bad taste in my mouth almost immediately. Repeatedly, Hannah writes about Vietnam vets, alcoholism, PTSD, wife beating, etc as stereotypes. There\u2019s no honest depth to the characters except Leni. Reading this book makes you think that ALL traumatized war vets become monsters. Ernst is a total worthless human being. Whatever he was before the Vietnam War, he comes back as a monster. There\u2019s a brief nod to something a \u201cshrink\u201d once mentioned to him. Otherwise, there\u2019s zero psychological or social support. Why was Ernst not seeing a therapist? Instead, he chose to be a raging alcoholic and to beat his wife and later his child. This is a choice. Plenty of war vets make other choices even though they\u2019ve been through hell. NOT ALL THOUGH. The battered wife. I\u2019ve known and worked with battered women. Most of them would have left an abusive husband over the rabbit heart. Most battered women will take abuse but will find the strength to leave the husband if he hurts their kids. NOT ALL THOUGH.That\u2019s the thing. The book takes the worst case scenario for EVERY character. Every single character, even Leni, is the least of the best possibilities. You know Job? Well, that\u2019s Cora and Leni. It\u2019s simply not believable. It\u2019s like a formula for a bestseller. I feel like for the \u201cbad thing happens that must be overcome\u201d part of the fiction novel formula, there was a list about a mile long:Vietnam War vetPTSD Mean Extreme povertyPregnant at sixteen Daughter will also be pregnant in high school.Battered wifeBattered DaughterCrazy preppers Homesteading difficultiesRunawayFall off a cliffSevere brain damage AlcoholismMurderCancer Oh. Also, multiple times Hannah mentions Alaska and how people worship \u201cweirdo Gods\u201d there.I get that Alaska means you can be yourself. Hannah manages to make it sound like a lot of them are crazy. Idk. I doubt they are any crazier than the crazies in the lower forty-eight. She also writes about the flip side- the community spirit. Still, if I was from Alaska, I\u2019d feel I was portrayed like a cartoon drawing. Hannah piles on catastrophe after catastrophe.How could she write The Nightingale and then this? I just am gobsmacked. It\u2019s like two different writers... though the writing is always beautiful.I read this overwrought mess of a book to the end. I\u2019m sorry I did. I\u2019d be happier dealing with my quiet guilt at an unfinished book than with my internal feelings of pervasive yuckiness over having read this book. Just. No.", "\u201cWere you ever out in the Great Alone,  when the moon was awful clear, And the icy mountains hemmed you in  with a silence you most could hear; With only the howl of a timber wolf, and  you camped there in the cold, A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world,  clean mad for the muck called gold; While high overhead, green, yellow and  red, the North Lights swept in bars? \u2014 Then you've a hunch what the music  meant. . . hunger and night and the stars. \u201c  ( From The Shooting of Dan McGrew by Robert W. Service) It's to the wilderness of Alaska, this \"Great Alone\", a most fitting description, that Leni Allbright and her parents go, seeking yet another place that her mother hoped would be the place that made her dad happy. Kristin Hannah with vivid descriptions takes the reader here and while I've never been to Alaska, I certainly felt as though I was. Ernt Allbright, a POW who returned home from Vietnam a very different man could never keep a job and moved his family from place to place, clearly suffers from PTSD. It isn't until they move to Alaska that 13 year old Leni , realizes just how bad things are and the imminent danger in their lives. I couldn't help but love Leni. She's wise for her age recognizing what might set off her father's rage. As she grows and her character develops, into a strong , amazing woman in spite of all the tragedy and heartache, I loved her even more. My favorite passage is from Leni's college application several years later: \"Books are the mile markers of my life. Some people have family photos or home movies to record their past. I've got books. Characters. For as long as I can remember, books have been my safe place. I read about places I can barely imagine and lose myself to journeys to foreign lands to save girls who didn't know they were really princesses. Only recently have I learned why I needed those faraway worlds.\" Leni has a loving bond with her mother and together they try to survive this place with the freezing, treacherous, winters and the most terrifying of dangers that they face within the cabin where they live - the mental instability, the volatility combined with alcohol, and violence of her father as he wreaks havoc in their lives and the people of the town. It is the friendships that Leni and Cora make with a fabulous cast of characters that help them survive it all. Large Marge was my favorite but I also loved Matthew who was the only friend Leni could remember having in her life. This is more than a coming of age story. It\u2019s about the reality of post war PTSD, the awful reality of spousal abuse, about the sense of community, of belonging, about survival not just in the wilderness of Alaska but in life in with challenges that seem insurmountable. I don't often cry when reading a book, but this was one of the times. It's gripping, gritty, heartbreaking and hopeful and illustrates the versatile storytelling of Kristin Hannah. It was impossible for me to forgive Ernt, even knowing that he was a POW, but he brought to mind the POW's bracelet I wore for a long time. I remember his name but out of privacy and respect for him, I won\u2019t mention it here . I\u2019ll only say that he was captured in 1971 and thankfully released in 1973. This book prompted me to search for him online. It appears that he stayed in the Army and then after retirement went on to the private sector. I hope he has had a peaceful, happy life.  I received an advanced copy of this book from St. Martin's Press through NetGalley.", "What a story! I mentioned this in one of my status updates and I think it is the best way to describe this book: every new scene in this book is out of the frying pan and into the fire!My wife recommended this book to me and we usually have a pretty good idea of what the other will like (probably a 95% success rate). We have both read and enjoyed The Nightingale, which is probably what Hannah is best known for even though she has quite an extensive resume of novels. This book is quite unlike The Nightingale, and, dare I say, even better.At first I thought it started slow and I was having trouble connecting to it. But, about 1/3 of the way through the intensity and the story really ramped up. From then on out it is a rollercoaster suspense-thriller-tear jerker that warms the heart and will terrify you with the possibilities of the human condition.I can easily recommend this to almost anyone. It is just great storytelling of a unique and captivating tale.", "its books like this that remind me why reading is such a passionate and worthwhile constant in my life. i have come to rely on books to help me learn, grown, empathise, and sometimes escape. and this story did all of that. but what i am grateful for, most of all, is how i was able to read about a place i have never been and fall in love with it, how i could find an undeniable softness for the harsh landscape of the alaskan wilderness, how i could come to understand the pure beauty of a place i have never seen. \n\u201cfor we few, the sturdy, the strong, the dreamers, alaska is home, always and forever, the song you hear when the world is still and quiet. you either belong here, wild and untamed yourself, or you dont.\u201d\ni loved being able to accompany leni as she came of age and learned to call alaska and its people home. yes, this story can be a bit dramatic at times. yes, there is a lot going on. i even saw a review describing this as the hallmark channel movie of books, and i totally get that. but none of that could lessen the deep feeling i got reading about leni find love in where she lived and with a boy who saw her. what a special story. \u21a0 4.5 stars", "Kristin Hannah fans will be more than satisfied!!! I found the story a little predictable- and not all characters as layered as I would have liked, yet the sincerity in which Kristin wrote this novel is admirable and beautiful....with much to respect for taking on these serious themes. Kristin\u2019s heart and passion is mixed between all her words on every page. The writing flows with emotional intimacy.This story is told through the eyes of Leni, daughter of a former Vietnam POW. Leni, an only child, had gone to four new schools in five years during her early pre- and teen years. She didn\u2019t make friends easy - or at all - at these new schools- and she worried about her parents constantly.Ernt and Cora, Leni\u2019s parents, were often fighting. Vietnam changed her Ernt. He returned home moody, quick to anger, and distant. Cora was engaged in a continual quest to find herself \u2014 taking spiritual workshops and human potential courses. Sure- when you\u2019re hurting - seeking help and support makes sense. It\u2019s tough for a young girl who feels they are - at times- the only \u2018mature\u2019 adult in the family. Leni was only 13- and never had time to act out as a normal teenager. The conditions of their family were just always much too fragile....to inhumane. Things were especially hard on Leni\u2019s mom, Cora. Leni felt very attached and protective of her mom - bringing them close - questionable if their closeness was always the best thing - or if boundaries between parent and child got crossed\u2014 however they experienced a type of trauma together neither should have had to experience. And in cases of emergency/ traumas- close is close is close: period! Leni says: \u201cOne thing every child of a POW knew was how easily people could be broken\u201d. ......and broken - and broken and broken again! We are witness to tragedies.....while getting to know Leni - her family - the community - (neighbor Large Marge is a standout character), Matthew, and life in Alaska. Abusive family secrets weigh heavily - innocence is robbed - leaving an urgency for survival. The Vietnam War divided our country.... The 70s were turbulent times: Many of us old farts remember them all too well \u2014\u201cFull of protests and marches and bombing and kidnappings. Young women were being abducted from college campuses\u201d. \u2014-The 70\u2019s - were confusing years for many. Dad, Ernt, was suffering from PTSD- had lost his job -was offered an opportunity in Alaska - a cabin to live in. Alaska seemed like a \u2018hopeful solution\u2019 for the Allbright family, but our author clearly reminds us that \u201c Life is \u2018not\u2019 circumstantial\u201d.Funny, how life works - isn\u2019t it?\u2014we bring ourselves with us no matter where we go - our problems tag along. They don\u2019t go away simply by changing locations. Leni is wise beyond her years: she had to be! Alaska, .....exquisite, breathtaking, and beautiful, is where Leni found love - lost love -created love - and grew stronger in who she is. And.....Alaska is where she came to feel most at home. I especially need to thank Saint Martin\u2019s Publishing .... I receive a \u2018surprise\u2019 finished Hardback copy of \u201cThe Great Alone\u201d in my mailbox. The book cover is gorgeous- Many thanks to Kristin Hannah too.", "Book coincidences. I always read multiple books at the same time, always have. So, I was reading History of Wolves, and because I had paper Arcs of both books and wanted to pass them on, I also started this one. Both deal with the trauma of war, but this one was set in Alaska, and I love books set in cold climates. It is the seventies and Ernt, who came back much changed from Vietnam, can't seem to settle. Moving his small family from place to place, until he is left a small cabin in Alaska, from a buddy who served with him. So off they go, very unprepared for the hardness and danger that Alaska presents. Cora, who loves and will do anything for her husband and their young teenage daughter, Leni.Some fabulous characters, fantastic setting, and some extremely challenging issues. I never felt sorry for Ernt, despite what he went through, he was not a very nice man. That is an understatement, spousal abuse to me is inexcusable, the effects on a young Leni, just terrible. There are many people they meet in Alaska that were loving and helpful, Leni starts a relationship and then tragedy strikes again. This story really pulled me in, couldn't look away, and yes the ending may be a bit treacly but let's just say some of these characters deserved some happiness. Enjoyed watching and learning as they learned to survive in Alaska, made friends and found stolen moments of joy. Yes, this made me teary up more than once, and I have to say everyone could use a guardian angel like Large Marge.ARC from publisher.", " \u2018\u2019Outside, night had fallen. A full moon cast blue-white light on everything. Stars filled the sky with pinpricks and elliptical smears of light. Up here, at night, the sky was impossibly huge and never quite turned black, but stayed a deep velvet blue. The world beneath it dwindled down to nothing: a dollop of firelight, a squiggly white reflection of moonlight on the tarnished waves.\u2019\u2019The Allbright's seem a typical American family trying to find its way in a nation tarnished by the effects of the Vietnam War, in a society that undergoes significant changes. Ernt, Cora and their teenage daughter, Leni. Ernt, a veteran of the war, suffers from PTSD turning what should be a family haven into a battlefield of turmoil, threats and ferocious insecurity. Dissatisfied with his country, surrendering to his absurd notions of how a country should be governed, he drags his family into the Last Frontier. Alaska. A place of unimaginable beauty and danger. Everything changes for Leni, Cora and the residents of what seemed like the ideal, closely-knit community because of one man\u2019s madness and vicious character.I am sorry to say that this novel left me cold and disappointed\u2026There is no doubt that the premise of the story is interesting and realistic. The descriptions of the Alaskan nature are breathtakingly beautiful and there are quite a few elements that made me feel invested in the story of the Allbright family initially. This historical era is one that always attracts my interest and Hannah did a good job transferring it into the heart of the narration. All the familiar 70s trademarks have been put into good use. The search for a spiritual destination, the notion of Unitarianism, the rallies for peace. The yet unnamed \u2018\u2019don\u2019t show, don\u2019t tell\u2019\u2019 PTSD, the IRA attacks, the Watergate, the nightmarish terrorist attack during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.In this background, enriched by many 70s cultural references, Hannah poses a major question: where does patriotism, the honest, peaceful love for one\u2019s country end and nationalism, racism and mass hysteria begin? How can women respond and defend themselves in an era when men still think they rule everyone\u2019s fate? The inseparable bond between a mother and a daughter, two survivors of a man\u2019s madness, is hauntingly beautiful, seen through the eyes of Leni, a bookish girl and one of the most well-composed characters in Contemporary Literature. However, I\u2019m afraid this is where my positive thoughts on this novel end\u2026The dialogue suffers from a number of cliches, in my opinion. Stilted and exaggerating like a cheesy Hollywood film. Repetition didn\u2019t do any favours to the continuation of the story. This is my main complaint with this novel. How many chapters do you need to say the same things again and again? A writer doesn\u2019t properly build tension in such a way. The only thing it made me feel was irritation and a deep desire to read the end and abandon the book altogether. I could have skipped pages after pages and I wouldn\u2019t have missed anything at all. The way many chapters ended seemed like the old lingering take on a protagonist\u2019s ridiculously lost expression in a soap opera. Not my ideal picture of an interesting book. On a side note, the references to The Thorn Birds and the friendship between Frodo and Sam were melodramatic, cheesy and irritating. In my opinion.In terms of characterization, I wasn\u2019t impressed at all. With the exception of Leni (whose romantic story was laughably bad), the rest of the characters left me utterly indifferent. I quickly lost patience with Cora. I mean, girl, you don\u2019t want to lose face or you really enjoy Ernt\u2019s you-know-what. That\u2019s fine as long as you are alone. But being blinded by your illusions and shoving your ridiculous excuses to your daughter\u2019s mind do little to ensure her safety. I didn\u2019t buy any of Cora\u2019s musings. Call me heartless, that\u2019s my opinion. Despite the fact that she takes some action, her character is no figure to look up to. At least, not according to my standards. Ernt is a loony. Plain and simple. No justification, no pretext. The excuse of PTSD is quickly wasted. He is mad and that\u2019s the end of it. Horrible character, written as a caricature to force drama. Don\u2019t even get me started on Matthew and Large Marge because we\u2019ll be here until Doomsday\u2026This novel is begging to become a Hollywood production. Unfortunately, I seldom watch these and \u2018\u2019Hollywood\u2019\u2019 books are absolutely not to my liking. I\u2019m certain that somewhere deep inside those pages, beyond all this repetition and drama, lies a perfectly good book and many trusted friends loved it. This is the reason why I grant 3 stars and not 2 (not that it matters but for argument\u2019s sake\u2026). For the beauty of the Alaskan territory and the character of Leni and for the fact that I was not the suitable reader for this book.

KRISTIN HANNAH grabbed my attention from the get-go with her freaky cold (Brrrrrrrr) descriptively atmospheric novel set in a remote 1970's Alaska where \"you can make one mistake, but the second one will kill you\"......literally. THE FIRST HALF of the story introduces the reader to the Allbright family and the shock of their unimaginably dangerous and unpredictable new life in the wild.LIVING ROUGH (Yikes!) in their inherited little cabin, they must haul water, grow their own vegetables, and hunt for food....all while armed and on the lookout for black bears and wolf packs....AND with only three months each year to prepare for the long, dark and treacherous winter months to come. BUT....harsh weather conditions, isolation and \"icy darkness\" is NOT their only fear....there is another. \"People go batshit in the dark.\" THE GREAT ALONE has something for everyone....engaging writing....suspense....adventure and great characters with names like MAD Earl, LARGE Marge and ha!....CRAZY Pete & Matilda. THERE IS also more than one story of love here, volatile family relationships, and invaluable friendships amidst the environmental dangers. THE GREAT ALONE is written with heart and heartbreak with an emphasis on survival....in more ways than one!

This was not family decision. Ernt made her family move there. His wife Cora who is suffering from his anger management issues left from traumatic experiences from war and his smart, brilliant, young daughter Leni is also confused to start at a place they couldn\u2019t locate on the map. They reluctantly obey his decision and did their best to make him happy by creating a new house life left in the middle of nowhere.

It\u2019s also gonna be TV series with Katherine Heigl (I\u2019d better read and skip the show because I don\u2019t want to hate story for wrong casting)Summary: This author is one of the most talented, creative, inspirational people on the earth. I loved her books so much. I never get bored to read them several times. And for the last words Great Alone! I LOVED IT 3 MILLIONS!", "Only 2 stars because she's a \"good\" writer and I did keep reading until the end to see what happened. Really deserves one star. What schlock! Was this meant to be a Young Adult book? Or the screenplay treatment for a bad Hallmark movie? As mentioned, Hannah's writing is quite nice and she paints quite a vivid and lovely picture of Alaska. But she does it OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. We get it. Alaska is wild and beautiful and harsh. On to the characters - each and everyone is a completely one dimensional caricature. The beautiful, love-struck mother with the loving, wealthy parents, who allows her crazy, penniless husband to force her and her teen daughter to move into a cabin with no electricity or toilet in Alaska. Glorious Mama (what was with the book being in third person but calling the parents \"Mama\" and \"Dad?) then allows crazy husband to beat the living hell out of her repeatedly (something the daughter never notices until Alaska). Daughter meanwhile just loves living in a shack in the tundra and magically meets the love of her life in the one room school. Never for a moment does she resent her beautiful, perfect mother for foisting this life upon her and refusing to leave her insane, violent husband. Dad is a mysteriously released POW who starts out lovely and ends up a complete nutjob. Neighbors are godsends or Doomsdayers, with no countervailing good or bad characteristics. The plot goes out of control - endless awful and ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE things happen. As Hannah reminds endlessly, Alaska is dangerous! But hey, fall in that ice, run your car off the road, fall down that ravine, take that punch to the face, have unprotected sex, make it as bad as you possibly can so your implausible redemption is all that schlockier. So many idiotic plot holes arise in the last 1/2 of the book and the love story is just so saccharine and unlikely. I rolled my eyes so often, I can't even believe I finished the book. Also, it is at least 150 pages too long. I know I enjoyed The Nightingale, so I was heartily disappointed by this one. SKIP!", "This is a great book with wonderful descriptive writing about the landscape and climate in Alaska. The majority of the book takes place there and it\u2019s amazing to me that anyone would love to live there, mainly because the lack of much daylight all winter long, and that winter lasts nine months.It is 1974 at the start of the book and Leni Allbright is the new girl in middle school in Seattle, at the age of thirteen she has already been in many \u201cnew\u201d schools, having moved around the country with her parents. Her father, Ernt, can never seem to find a place that suits him, where he can find a job and be happy. He came back from Vietnam a changed man, according to her mother Cora. Leni can\u2019t really remember her father before the war. All she knows is the constant arguing between her parents which usually ended with crying and apologies.Ernt gets a letter from the father of a buddy whom he served with in the war. He has left his cabin and forty acres of land in Alaska to Ernt. This sounds like just the answer he has been looking for. Cora, who will do anything for Ernt because she loves him deeply, agrees to move the family there.\u201dI need this Cora. I need a place where I can breathe again. Up there, the flashbacks and nightmares will stop. I know it\u201d.What follows is quite an adventure. When they arrive in the summer Alaska seems like a beautiful paradise. They learn how to garden and raise goats and chickens. Then the winter comes, with it\u2019s six hours of sunshine a day and terrible cold. We learn what it means to survive a winter in Alaska, there are many friendly people in the small town where they live who reach out to help them stock supplies for the winter. Ernt is unhappy about the lack of money and provisions and he takes it out on Cora. Ernt is really a terrible man and now the situation has escalated into spousal physical abuse. Leni meanwhile has struck up a friendship with a local boy, Matthew, with whom she bonds immediately.There are wonderfully described characters in this book. I loved Large Marge who would do anything to help her friends. Mad Earl is a man who is mad at the government, mad at the military and the war which took his son and a very bad influence on Ernt. Matthew is a big hearted, loving young man whose father Tom Walker is the owner of the salon in town and has lots of influence along with money. Tom and Large Marge begin to sense that things are not alright in the Allbright household but there is little they can do because Ernt won\u2019t allow anyone to help them.Without going into the plot I can tell you that it is constantly changing, made me carry my Kindle wherever I went to keep up with the story and there were no slow spots for me in the flow of this book. There are unexpected tragedies and heartbreak, there is love and resilience and the characters of Cora and Leni are constantly changing and growing. In the author\u2019s acknowledgements I learned that the story is loosely based on her family\u2019s experiences, you can google it to learn more about her family history.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a well written, beautifully descriptive book that will take you on an adventure that you won\u2019t soon forget.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley, thank you.", "4 Stars.Alaska, 1974: This is the story of the trials and tribulations of the Allbright family. Life has not been easy for Ernt, Cora or their daughter Leni. Ernt is a POW, home from Vietnam. He is now prone to fits of anger and extreme violence. Ernt considers alcohol to be his savior \u2013 yet for his wife and daughter, it is the devil.After coming home from the war, Ernt feels as though he doesn\u2019t fit in anywhere and that everyone is against him. In an incredible turn of events, a home is bequeathed to Ernt in Kaneq, Alaska and he feels that it is has last chance. Wanting to make him happy and keep him calm, Cora and Leni agree. The move is one for which they are wholly unprepared. Winters are fierce, harsh and absolutely terrifying. There are only 6 hours of sunlight a day, and the conditions are dire. The atmosphere and the wilderness however, give something to Leni Allbright that she has never had before, peace and solitude. If only it was enough. Cora is a woman who fell very hard for a man who treats her the way that no woman should ever be treated. Her family is trapped in a vicious cycle, one whose demons it seems impossible to out run, even after having reached the ends of the earth. \u201cThe Great Alone\u201d is a novel so full of beautiful, vivid descriptions that I could close eyes and see the land, the mountains, the water: the immense beauty that is Alaska - even though I have never been there before. The characters are captivating and rich. They made me so very anxious at times, I couldn\u2019t help but clench my fists and hold on for dear life, yet they also made me love. \u201cThe Great Alone\u201d is my first Kristin Hannah novel \u2013 it will not be my last. This was Traveling Sister Read. The discussion for this book was very lively and full of emotion. I was glad to have my sisters close while I read it!Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin\u2019s Press and Kristin Hannah for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review. Published on NetGalley, Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 2.17.18.", "I think Kristen Hannah is like a fine wine. With each new novel, she gets better and better. Thirteen year old Leni and her parents move to the Alaskan wilderness as a possible solution to her dad's illness. He suffers from PTSD having returned from Vietnam broken, with an extreme vision and little survival skills.Once the harshness of winter sets in, the human spirit is tested in a family whose relationship is already in a delicate balance; the lack of daylight brings with it the challenges of isolation and survival. The darkness envelopes them and tempers are shorter. Abuse becomes the weapon of choice for her father to battle the inner demons that visit him almost daily. The sacrifices both her and her mother make as a means of survival come at a high cost. Even love is a threat in this environment. The wildness of Alaska will either break them or strengthen who they are and who they will come to be.This is Hannah's crown jewel. 5\u2b50\ufe0f", "Like a curved, upturned palm, Alaska beckons with her beauty, her majesty, and her prolific grandeur. The awe-inspiring allure gestures first until the ruggedness of her backbone sets in.The Allbright family lives on the edge of a nomad's existence. Seattle, once filled with promise, no longer does. It's 1974 and these displaced individuals are the walking wounded. Ernt bears the mental and physical scars of being a prisoner of war held in Vietnam. The nightmares are no longer wrapped in the darkness. They seep into the day and explode without warning. Cora, his wife, flits back and forth with her feeble attempts to sidestep his abusive behavior. And caught in the throws of this disfunction is thirteen year old Leni. Her silence lays a mantle over the brokenness.Ernt receives a letter from the father of his best friend who was killed in Vietnam. Earl Harlan tells Ernt that Bo left a sizable plot of land and a cabin to him in Kaneq, Alaska. It's his for the taking. Ernt whoops with joy and begins to sell everything they have for a beat-up VW bus in order to make the journey. Cora sees the face of the love she long remembered from before the war. Perhaps this is the new beginning that they are so desperate for. And Leni just yearns for a place of permanence for once in her young life.With hardly a plan or adequate preparation, the Allbrights find themselves in the jaw-dropping majesty of the Alaskan wilderness. With the help of Mad Earl's family and the resourceful Marge Birdsall, also known as Large Marge, the Allbrights cut into the land and start to dig in. Like the famous line from Game of Thrones: \"Winter is coming.\" Tremendous effort must be put forth in order to exist through the brutality of an Alaskan winter.\"Alaska herself can be Sleeping Beauty one minute and a bitch with a sawed-off shotgun the next.\"Filled with grizzly bear, caribou, wolves, and enormous moose, danger is around every turn. But our story brushes against more than Nature......human nature to be exact. Ernt begins to resent his new neighbors as the darkness within him takes hold once again. And once again, Cora invents excuses for Ernt's behavior until she begins to believe it all herself. She and Leni hardly breathe in the confines of that tiny cabin. Kristin Hannah creates a storyline that lays bare the tragedies of war, broken families, unfulfilled dreams, and the explosive side of a dormant wound. Her characterizations are remarkable as life unravels from 1974 to 1986. We will experience the dramatic changes that take place within Leni as she shields herself from the rages that exist within as well as those from the treacherous land itself. Kristin Hannah writes from a source of profound respect for the individuals who ramble down the uneven terrain of life. Her words will invoke a gamut of feelings within you as you leave your own footprints behind. A remarkable read, indeed, and so worthy of your attention.I received a copy of The Great Alone through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to St. Martin's Press and to Kristin Hannah for the opportunity.", "The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah is a 2018 St. Main\u2019s Press publication. Alaska- beautiful, harsh, dangerous, addictive-After Ernst comes home from Vietnam, he flounders, suffering from what we would now term, PTSD. His wife, Cora, sees a much different man in front of her than the one she married. But, she is determined to help him, and so when he inherits a home in Alaska, she and their thirteen -year old daughter, Leni, follow him into unchartered territory. As they begin their journey they are filled with renewed hope and optimism, but simmering underneath that forced enthusiasm, is a great deal of nervousness and trepidation. However, they could not have possibly prepared themselves for living \u2018off grid\u2019, in this raw, startlingly beautiful landscape, which is sharply juxtaposed against the harsh, brutal winters, the intensity of mother nature, and the terrifying odds of surviving in such extreme isolation. Yet for Cora and Leni, the danger that lurks around every corner, is within the confines of their own four walls. As a voracious reader, I am always surprised by how many amazing books and authors I have yet to sample. I have three or four Kristin Hannah novels languishing on my bookshelves that I am always meaning to read. I have heard such great things about this author, and of course, she was catapulted into the \u2018household name\u2019 club with her knock out hit- \u2018The Nightingale\u201d a couple of years back. Anyway, long story short, I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher, which, of course, meant I had to read it and then review it, which is how this book, despite countless others to choose from, became my first Kristin Hannah novel. I started this book a very long time ago, with the best of intentions of reading it prior to the release date, but became very frustrated with it almost immediately. As the awesome reviews began to trickle in, I started to get a little nervous. I wasn\u2019t feeling it. So, I put it aside for a while. I ended up reading this novel in fits and starts until I got tired of seeing it on my bedside table, and decided to plow through until the end, whether I wanted to or not. The subject matter is very difficult to read about, and Hannah doesn\u2019t hold back in her depictions of abuse. It is very graphic, and I admit, as much as I enjoy a good dark and twisted tale, there are some topics I just can\u2019t take, domestic violence being one of them. The taut atmosphere, being completely isolated, living in a cabin out in the middle of such extremes, with no one to call for help, never knowing when the next explosive confrontation would come, made this a hard book for me to consume in large quantities. It was just too nerve wracking and intense. I started to dread turning the next page. Growing up in an era where women fought to bring these subjects out in the open, to educate the public on the patterns of abuse, I still argued with myself over Cora\u2019s decisions to stay with Ernst. If not for herself, for her daughter!! I know, I know, Cora exhibited the classic, textbook cycle of abuse. However, I still can\u2019t quite get past subjecting her child to that environment. Don\u2019t judge me. I still think I\u2019m right, although, on paper, I \u2018get\u2019 the psychology of it all. But, Leni deserved better than that. Therefore, I found myself running that loop in my head, chiding myself for judging, but unapologetic for my feelings, and ended up getting myself all upset and stressed out, as a result.  But, moving on- This is not the only problem I had with the book. Please everyone in the US. Look up 911. Learn the history of it. It was around, but not common, even in big cities. We take it for granted now, so this might not have registered, but in the early seventies, calling 911 was not a thing. I also noticed a few other gaffes, like Cora smoking on her last cigarette, only to miraculously have a fresh supply the very next morning. I\u2019m no expert on PTSD, and I am not making light of it, nor am I suggesting Ernst didn\u2019t suffer from it. He did have many of the hallmark symptoms, but frankly, I\u2019m not sure you can blame ALL his behavior on that. His was classic abusive behavior, and I suspect it might have developed no matter what. Cora was so young when she married, and I think she mythologized the \u2018before and after\u2019 scenario to make excuses to stay in the marriage, claiming her husband was \u2018sick\u2019. Oh, he was sick, all right, but not only from the effects of the war. This was all swirling around in my head as I embarked on the second half of the book. It was dark, intense, edgy, suspenseful, but not in a way I normally like. In fact, it was downright depressing. But, then a miracle happened-  The wrinkles ironed out a little, and I was able to focus on Leni and Matthew, which was the story\u2019s saving grace. I ended up liking the way everything turned out, even though it was sad on so many levels. While I had been turning and tossing and fretting over this review, worrying about this 'critical' kick I\u2019ve been experiencing lately, as I turned the last page, I had an epiphany! It hit me like a ton of bricks. I was experiencing many of the same emotions I normally feel after reading a romance novel. Then I remembered that, Hannah has also been known for her women\u2019s fiction, which usually tends to include a little romance. This quote- \u201cShe knew fact from fiction but couldn\u2019t give up her love stories. They made her feel as if women could be in control of their own destinies. Even in a cruel, dark world that tested women to the very limits of their endurance, the heroines of these novels could prevail and find true love.\u201dOMG!! This is an epic LOVE STORY!! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. OMG!! All this time I was focused on Alaska, the landscape, the environment, the seventies, the domestic violence, the PTSD, all the points everyone spoke of in all the reviews I\u2019d read. Love is mentioned a lot too, the mother/daughter bond, the friendships, but no one wanted to say anything about THE LOVE STORY!! No one wanted to hint around that there is romance in this story, but....Leni was tested to the brink of her endurance, yet she prevailed and found true love and despite everything she gets her happily ever after!! It\u2019s romance 101!!!!!!!!!!!!!PERFECT!! And that, my fine friends why I read love stories. Seriously though, please, stop saying you don\u2019t like romance, or love stories, because, yes, yes you do! It just had to be labeled as something else, so you didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been reading all along- An EPIC love story!! Leni and Matthew! Belonging, finding your tribe,family, separations, hardships, endurance, survival against all odds, true love, and happy ever afters!! Yep! It\u2019s all there. All the elements of a great love story! No, it is certainly not a warm and fuzzy, heartwarming story, that\u2019s for sure, But, it is highly emotional, sentimental, redeeming, and so very satisfying. \u2018Her\u2019 If Matthew didn't melt your heart, check your pulse, because you might be dead. And, of course, no one deserved that HEA more than Leni!! Sure, of course, it's not JUST a love story, as I've made clear at the beginning of this review, but at the end of the day, after all is said and done, that's the part of story that endures, the part that burrowed into my heart. So, Kristin Hannah did what she does best, apparently, and pulled off a NYT bestseller, to boot. Kudos! I do understand the homage to Alaska, all of which was described beautifully. I do \u2018get\u2019 the importance of the story, the messages embedded within, and appreciated the characterizations, especially that of the supporting cast, the pacing and all the other spectacular parts of this book that resonated with so many people, not just the parts that made an impression on me.  But, there were some warts and flaws, and I think maybe the author skimmed over the research she should have done, which is why I can\u2019t in good conscience give it a five star rating, although I am tempted to. Still, I am SO glad, despite the initial emotional drain, that I eventually finished it. It turned out to be a surprisingly rewarding read. These characters will pass through my thoughts on many occasions in the future and I will wonder how they are doing from time to time, but I know they are going to make it just fine!! 4 stars", "*4.5 stars* rounded up for The Great Alone!THE GREAT ALONE by KRISTIN HANNAH is an absolutely wonderful, spellbinding, powerful, tense, touching, and heartbreaking domestic family drama story that was an all-consuming and emotional read for me. \u00a0I was totally captivated with what I was reading and it was extremely hard for me to put down. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else but this story and I don\u2019t think I have felt so many different emotions from reading a book in quite some time. The way that The Great Alone made me feel is exactly how I like to feel when reading a book! \u00a0KRISTIN HANNAH delivers an impressive, well-written and beautifully descriptive story here that takes you on an emotional adventure of the Allbright family which is set in remote Alaska in the 1970\u2019s. \u00a0I fell in love with the character of Leni and genuinely cared for her and her wellbeing throughout this whole novel.The storyline was so engaging, the characters are all so well-developed, the setting was absolutely fantastic and the ending was bittersweet but satisfying. \u00a0Highly recommend!Published: February 6th, 2018Thank you so much to my fellow Traveling Sisters for another wonderful reading experience!Thank you so much to NetGalley, St. Martin\u2019s Press and Kristin Hannah for providing me with an ARC in exchange for a review!

Beautiful. Emotional. Atmospheric. Heart-wrenching. Stunning. Raw. Intense. I love Kristin Hannah\u2019s writing! I\u2019ve been a fan of her for years, but fell absolutely head over heels in love with her writing after reading The Nightingale. Though I wouldn\u2019t class this book as highly as my love for The Nightingale, it was still an extremely powerful and thoroughly enjoyable novel that I truly loved reading. This story revolves around thirteen-year-old Leni who moves to Alaska with her highly unstable and unpredictable parents. Her father yearns to live \u201coff the grid\u201d and live off the land. There are many unforgettable characters who become a part of their new lives in Alaska \u2013 each one bringing a new layer to this captivating story. I highly recommend this wonderful book!", "5 Stars for The Great Alone... Alaska. It\u2019s 1974 and a family of three, including a father mentally traumatized by his service in the Vietnam War, move to Alaska to a forty acre plot of land left to him by a fellow soldier who never made it out.Life there is so hard and very bleak. This story is fast paced, and riveting. The characters so beautifully brought to life. Such an atmospheric read, I am so happy that I was able to read this at a time when we have our own Arctic Blast going through here in Michigan.Highly Recommended!!Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin\u2019s Press for the opportunity to read this ARC!!", "4.5 starsI was a bit out of my usual comfort zone as far as reading genres when I came to this book. When I was about 5 percent into the book I was loving it, but as I got just a little bit further I thought to myself, \"if I wasn't committed to reading this for NetGalley, I'd move onto something else.\" However, after taking a deep breath and persevering with the book, I came away with a healthy admiration for this author's writing. I've held the lifelong belief that while reading books I've travelled all over the world in my mind. For this reason, I do not feel at all like I've missed out due to my anemic personal travel log. One of the gifts I received from this book was the very unique experience of living \"off the grid\" in Alaska.It's the early 1970s, and 13 year old Lenora (Leni) Allbright is living with the stress and uncertainty of her parents' volatile marriage. Her father Ernt is a Vietnam POW, never quite the same upon his discharge from the Armed Forces. His sleep is often disturbed by flashbacks and he's unable to control his jealously where his attractive and dedicated wife Cora is concerned. Leni has too often seen her father's hair trigger violence towards her mother, as well as Cora's willingness to forgive without consequences. Cora and Ernt fell in love quite young, culminating in unexpected pregnancy and a rushed, simple wedding. Cora came from wealth and her parents disapproved of the marriage, but her love for Ernt was steadfast. Even though Ernt didn't come home from the war the same man, Cora stoically dealt with the rollercoaster moods from her husband. As Leni witnesses her parents riding the wild emotions of their marriage, their sexual passions still intact... she's a young teenager with a secret to be embarrassed about. Her father sometimes hits her mother. Then a life-changing decision is suddenly made: Ernt receives a letter from the father of a fellow POW- one who didn't make it home alive. His comrade willed him some land and a home in Alaska. Ernt views this opportunity as a lifeline; a place where he can live in solitude off the land. A place to start anew. With hope and some trepidation, Cora agrees to leave their Seattle home along with Leni and Ernt for an unknown future in Alaska. When the Allbrights arrive in this remote strip of Alaska, it's quite unsettling just how \"off the grid\" this new life will be. There is no running water or electricity, and their modest cabin is littered with dead bugs. There is no bathroom; those needs are met by an outhouse. The only means of communication with their fellow cove inhabitants is by ham radio. They are also warned by the locals how easily one can die during the cruel Alaska winters. The Allbrights must learn how to hunt and fish, can foods, tend to livestock and cut firewood... just to name a few life-saving skills. During the heart of an Alaskan winter, there are barely 8 hours of light in the day. Talk about cabin fever! This was where I hit critical mass in the book and felt so claustrophobic and disturbed that I wished to put aside the book. Ernt at first thrives with the simplicity and physicality of working the land, but does not do well when the unrelenting winter hits. I won't get into the nuts and bolts of the story. Suffice it to say, and I quote Leni, her parents were in a \"sick, twisted love that bound her parents together.\" There are characters that you will grow to love in this book, and one will absolutely turn your stomach. This is a story that is rich, atmospheric and fraught with great emotions. I came away from this book with utter respect and appreciation for the people who homestead in Alaska, with all its beauty and challenges. For all the hard physical work to survive there, they seem to love it and would have it no other way.Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the gift of a great read.", "There\u2019s gold, and it\u2019s haunting and haunting;It\u2019s luring me on as of old;Yet it isn\u2019t the gold that I\u2019m wantingSo much as finding the gold.It\u2019s the great, big, broad land \u2018way up yonder,It\u2019s the forests where silence has lease;It\u2019s the beauty that thrills me with wonder,It\u2019s the stillness that fills me with peace. Robert ServiceThis book got me to thinking about why I read and at times it would seem I have as many answers as there are moments to consider them..For me I guess it all began when I was a child. Back then I read to escape. To slip silently, unnoticed, away from the here and now.  Well now Kristin Hannah took me to Alaska and I loved every moment I spent with her, within The Great Alone. As the story opens we meet the Allbright family. Leni is but thirteen in 1974 when her father Ernt comes home with one of his bright idea smiles and tells them he has been left a parcel of land from a deceased war buddy. The land is in Alaska. Leni\u2019s parents share a passionate, tumultuous relationship. But her father Ernt has not been the same since his return, from the Vietnam War. These days he is always on edge, always bristling; he drank too much and had bad nightmares. The worst part was how quickly he angered, and how often he angered. Without the slightest provocation, especially when he drank, which he did, often.But Ernt is convinced that things will be better in Alaska, the last frontier, free from the daily demands of civilization, free to live off the land and enjoy nature\u2019s bounty.I have lived in Ontario\u2019s north country, well at least as far north as any road would take you at that time. An isolated post, the government called it. From there we flew further north still, into the native reserves and the magnificent, spell binding, haunting, silent beauty of the north land. Breathtaking and oh so deadly. I have laid under the summer stars and stood frozen, blinded by the winter landscape, kidnapped by the northern lights. Captive and amazed. Even now words fail me. Still I was seriously way south of places like Alaska.It is really hard to put my finger on the magic that Hannah has created here but I\u2019m going to try and I guess the best place to start is with her characters. I was first introduced to Hannah\u2019s ability to flesh out characters when I read The Nightingale, so I should not have been so surprised at the talent on display here. Her people, the good and the bad, come alive on these pages and fixed themselves firmly in my minds eye. I loved Large Marge and was so positively crushed by Leni\u2019s father Ernt that I found myself forgetting to breath when he was around. And there are more, not the least of which is Leni herself, bound by circumstance to a harsh, resplendent world and an untenable future. Both captivated by and victim to this unrelenting and unforgiving land and her parent\u2019s toxic relationship. I find myself thinking of Alaska as one her characters, it is such a big part of this story and Hannah\u2019s ability to take me there both baffles and astounds. There is no one passage I find myself wanting to share to further demonstrate this skill, no it doesn\u2019t lie in one or even a handful of passages. It is just there, hidden almost, behind every word, carved out over time and painted with slow, vivid strokes; cut on the very edge of the often lethal, always brutal and delicate artistry of nature\u2019s awesome bounty and sweeping, panoramic vistas. Oh my. I am far less than equal to the task of relating the awesome power of this novel. You will not want to miss it. Wow, respect.Five fully captivated stars. PssssssssssssssstAs an added bonus Hannah had me pulling Robert Service (talk about an ode to the North) off my bookshelves and once again exploring his spells of the Yukon and other musings. It was like visiting with an old and trusted friend, one that helped inform my own poetic coming of age. Priceless!", "\u201cAnd you,\u201d Large Marge said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your story, missy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a story.\u201d\u201cEveryone has a story. Maybe yours just starts up here.\u201dI was on the look-out for a novel set around quiet people, and\u00a0The Great Alone looked like one to fulfill that promise with \u201cthe harsh, uncompromising beauty of Alaska.\u201d Plus, the mention of exploring PTSD in the father figure piqued my interest.The bonus was when I started reading the book and became quickly swept up in Leni's life. She's thirteen when the novel begins, about to enter another new school since her parents move the family rapidly from place to place (\"in the last four years, she\u2019d gone to five schools\"), and she's keen on drawing as little attention to herself as possible. My kind of girl.Afterward, the storyline unspools easily as the family arrives in Alaska, at the notice of a letter, which leads to stories set on surviving\u00a0the wilderness of Alaska and the dangers lurking inside their home.\n\n\n\nTo get all I need off my mind, I'd like to share a list of things I took note of during my reading of\u00a0The Great Alone:(Spoilers from here.)\u2022 I have to start off on the right foot by featuring this all-encompassing quote on Leni's bookish love (and mine, by default):\u201cBooks are the mile markers of my life. Some people have family photos or home movies to record their past. I\u2019ve got books. Characters. For as long as I can remember, books have been my safe place.\u201d\u2022 I loved reading about the vast landscape of \u201cthe wild, spectacular beauty\u201d of Alaska's unfamiliar terrain. But I have to note the many, many descriptions\u2026 Personally, I'm not one for reading more than a couple of sentences on a character's surroundings or the peculiar weather outside. I enjoy it more when the author spends time\u00a0on dialogue, instead of useless descriptions that my eyes gloss over as it is. None of it seemed to amount to much; the words just passed through me.\u2022 On a brighter note, this leads me to talk about the characters. Three noteworthy relationships drove the story forward for me, including Leni with Matthew, Leni with Mama (aka Cora), and Large Marge with literally anyone because she's that dynamic. Also, major bonus points for having a character in here named Natalie.\u201cI followed a man up here. Classic story. I lost the man and found a life. Got my own fishing boat now. So I get the dream that brings you here, but that\u2019s not enough. You\u2019re going to have to learn fast.\u201d Natalie put on her yellow gloves. \u201cI never found another man worth having. You know what they say about finding a man in Alaska\u2014the odds are good, but the goods are odd.\u201dThis a classic example of \"How can I become so invested in a character by the end of the paragraph?\"\u2022 My aesthetic is having Large Marge shut down entitled men. I'm still rattled by how she expertly handled\u00a0Ernt Allbright's\u00a0volatile, moody, and sharp-tempered self.\u201cSit down, Ernt,\u201d Large Marge said.\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cSit down or I\u2019ll knock you down,\u201d Large Marge said.Mama gasped.Dad sat down on the sofa beside Mama. \u201cThat\u2019s not really the way to talk to a man in his own home.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get me started on what a real man is, Ernt Allbright. I\u2019m holding on to my temper, but it could run away with me. And you do not want to see a big woman come at you. Trust me. So shut your trap and listen.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Speaking of which, I was counting down the pages till Ernt would be shown his way out of Alaska for good. He made everything and everyone hurt so deeply.\u00a0I never trusted him to be alone with Cora. Winter is coming took on a whole new meaning with him in the picture.\u00a0\u201cYou could always tell when Dad was gone. Everything was easier and more relaxed in his absence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSourceSo I was beyond thankful the moment the townsfolk intervened upon seeing his utterly abusive behavior towards his family. The\u00a0magnitude of Large Marge and Mr. Walker stepping in to help Leni and her mom stayed with me ever since. Anyone daring to rightfully put Ernt in his place has my evergrowing admiration!\u201cYou want to fight this battle?\u201d Large Marge advanced, bracelets clattering. \u201cIf this young woman misses a single day of school, I will call the state and turn you in, Ernt Allbright. Don\u2019t think for one second I won\u2019t. You can be as batshit crazy and mean as you want, but you are not going to stop this beautiful girl from finishing high school. You got it?\u201d\u201cThe state won\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cOh. They will. Trust me. You want me talking to the authorities about what goes on here, Ernt?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit.\u201d\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m a big woman with a big mouth. You want to push me?\u201dIn the wake of those words, I\u2019ve never loved a character more than Marge Birdsall. Showing Cora and Leni that they have a support system around them was a grandiose\u00a0moment.I felt it even more acutely after having watched Jo Wilson's centric episode in Grey's Anatomy, focusing on domestic abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\u2022 Which brings me to my next point: The perceptive connection that bonds mother and daughter together like peas in a pod. \u201cTwo of a kind.\u201d It was both agonizing and admiring to see them stick so fiercely by one another. \u201cMama was Leni\u2019s one true thing.\u201dThey had the kind of relationship that required the simplest measure: \u201cOne always knew when to be strong for the other.\u201d\u00a0It was refreshing to see such an allied bond present between Cora and Leni.\u201cI\u2019m your friend.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re thirteen. I\u2019m thirty. I\u2019m supposed to be a mother to you. I need to remember that.\u201d\u2022 Which leads me to my favorite point in the book: The exhilarating rush of giddy, young love shared between Leni and Matthew in 1978. I loved this part of the book so much, I can't bear to shorten it on my note. I haven't felt such fierce dedication to a literary couple in months and months. All this time I was seeking for a book to just get me when it came to those first signs of infatuation;\u00a0The Great Alone did it so right.\u201cLeni couldn\u2019t help thinking how small they were in this big dangerous world, just kids who wanted to be in love.\u201dI went through all the stages with Leni, from seeking a friend to share her secrets and longings and bookish love with, to become so easily swept up in the intoxicating head rush that is all grown-up Matthew Walker. He got her like no one else did.\u201cShe made lists in her head of things she wanted to say to him, had whole conversations by herself, over and over. \u201dI actually ached when Leni and Matthew were separated for pages at a time because of circumstances beyond their measure. He was our light in the brutal darkness of Alaska.\u201cNight after night, week after week, she lay in her bed, missing Matthew. Her love for him\u2014a warrior, hiking mountains, crossing streams\u2014strode into the wild borderlands of obsession.Near the end of July, she began to have negative fantasies\u2014him finding someone else, falling in love, deciding Leni was too much trouble. She ached for his touch, dreamed of his kiss, talked to herself in his voice.I can feel the pain oozing out of this text.But my most cherished moment came back when she first realized the switch in her mind:\u201cIt didn't take Leni long to know that she was in trouble. She thought about Matthew constantly. At school she began to study his every move; she watched him as she would a prey animal, trying to glean intent from action. His hand sometimes brushed hers beneath the desk, or he touched her shoulder as he passed by her in the classroom. She didn\u2019t know if those brief contacts were intentional or meaningful, but her body responded instinctively to each fleeting touch. Once she\u2019d even risen from her chair, pushed her shoulder into his palm like a cat seeking attention. It wasn\u2019t a thought, that lifting up, that unknown need; it just happened. And sometimes, when he talked to her, she thought he stared at her lips the way she stared at his. She found herself secretly mapping his face, memorizing every ridge and hollow and valley, as if she were an explorer and he her discovery.\u201d\n\nScouring my neverending notes for a scene that captures the easygoing nature between the two was quite tough, but then I found this:\u201cBut in her mind, he was Matthew, the fourteen-year-old kid who\u2019d showed her frogs\u2019 eggs and baby eagles, the boy who\u2019d written her every week. Dear Leni, it\u2019s hard at this school. I don\u2019t think anyone likes me\u00a0\u2026 And to whom she\u2019d written back. I know a lot about being the new kid in school. It blows. Let me give you a few tips\u00a0\u2026This\u00a0\u2026 man was someone else, someone she didn\u2019t know. Tall, long blond hair, incredibly good-looking. What could she say to this Matthew?He reached into his backpack, pulled out the worn, banged-up, yellowed version of The Lord of the Rings that Leni had sent him for his fifteenth birthday. She remembered the inscription she\u2019d written in it. Friends forever, like Sam and Frodo.\u201d*cries actual tears of joy*\u00a0It's scary to put on paper, but they changed something within me. The state of utter fragility and vulnerability that their love put them in\u00a0stopped me cold and made me think twice of its power.As I read, I was reminded of this tentative song I recently discovered by mxmtoon.\u2022 So you could only imagine my devastation to the unexpected (supposed) ending of Matthew being hurt beyond repair when all he was trying to do was save Leni...\u201cI\u2019m the reason he\u2019s hurt. He tried to save me. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t do anything else, Leni. Not after what happened to his mom. I know my son. Even if he\u2019d known the price, he would have tried to rescue you.\u201dI've never felt such visible pain and hurt and rage. My mind was so overrun with thoughts and emotions; I felt like I was in a zombie state when I dared to get up from the book. In the wake of all the hurt we went through with Leni, everything seemed so banal in the real world. Returning to the Outside felt like involuntary breaking off the rural spell we\u2019d been under.\n\n\n\n\u201cA girl needs to be strong in this world.\u201dI just couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that I was supposed to move on like nothing happened after we left Matthew, unsure of what the future held for him. I was so damn invested in every single moment shared between Matthew and Leni; it hurt more than I could bear to merely think of him without her. So I was pretty much left numb after that. I honestly couldn't have cared less, reading about everything that occurred to the characters in the aftermath. All I wanted was justice for Leni's\u00a0kind, grief-stricken Matthew.\u201cHe\u2019d been drowning for all of these years without her, and she was the shore he\u2019d been flailing to find.\u201dIn hindsight, I should've known who I was dealing with before entering the novel. After all, I did read The Nightingale two winters ago. And coupled with the fact that I read 400 pages of this newest release in a single day, my reading experience took quite the toll on me. What is fresh air? But as the saying goes \"Hindsight is 20/20. Everyone has a clear view from the rearview mirror.\u201d\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Water found its way into the smallest cracks and undermined the sturdiest foundations. Chunks of land that had been steady for generations fell like slag heaps on the roads below, taking houses and cars and swimming pools down with them. Trees fell over, crashed into power lines; electricity was lost. Rivers flooded their banks, washed across yards, ruined homes. People who loved each other snapped and fights erupted as the water rose and the rain continued.\u201cLeni felt edgy, too. She was the new girl at school, just a face in the crowd; a girl with long hair, parted in the middle, who had no friends and walked to school alone.\u201cNow she sat on her bed, with her skinny legs drawn up to her flat chest, a dog-eared paperback copy of Watership Down open beside her.\u201dHer parents were in the other room arguing, shouting at each other. Her mother, Cora, pleading with him to listen, her father angry over some she did, or didn\u2019t, do. Her father, Ernt Allbright, angry at the world, angry since he was sent to Vietnam, a POW sent home to solve his own problems that didn\u2019t exist before the war, the sights he\u2019d seen, and can\u2019t un-see. Before everything he\u2019d learned as a result. He said \n\u201cThe world is being run by lunatics. It\u2019s not my America anymore.\u201d\n And then her father receives a letter from the father of Bo Harlan, one of his buddies who was in the helicopter with him when they went down, were captured and then tortured. His body bears the physical scars, the physical aches and pains, but his mind is still tortured. The letter is to let Ernt know that it was Bo\u2019s wish that he inherit his land, and home, in Alaska. \u201dDad wanted a new beginning. Needed it. And Mama needed him to be happy.\u201cSo they would try again in a new place, hoping geography would be the answer. They would go to Alaska in search of this new dream. Leni would do as she was asked and do it with a good attitude. She would be the new girl in school again. Because that was what love was.\u201dAnd so they pack up and move what little they own, and head for Alaska. An adventure. For all of them, a new beginning.As they take in their first look at the town of Kaneq, with dilapidated buildings with peeling paint, built perched above the mud with a boardwalk that connects the buildings. An old town with history that appears to have seen better days, but it\u2019s also a history that they take pride in. From the original Natives who settled the area, to the fur traders from Russia, and then came those men looking for gold. It still bears the aura of those gold rush days, but it\u2019s 1974.In part, this is a coming-of-age story, Leni is just thirteen as this begins, and this town, remote as it seemed when they first arrived, is Leni\u2019s link to people other than her parents. The home they live in is even more remote. \u201dThey lived on a piece of land that couldn\u2019t be accessed by water at low tide, on a peninsula with only a handful of people and hundreds of wild animals, in a climate harsh enough to kill you. There was no police station, no telephone service, no one to hear you scream.For the first time, she really understood what her dad had been saying. Remote\u201d.When she starts school there, it is a small enough school that there is only one other person close to her age, a boy. Matthew. With their love of books and reading a common bond, it isn\u2019t long before they become friendly. Friends. Alaska\u2019s wilderness attracts those who believes in their ability to withstand its inhospitable nature, those with that drive to conquer and mold a Garden of Eden out of an uncultivated land, to hold onto whatever remains of that pioneer spirit, gumption, that drove those pioneers of old to conquer other new, uninhabitable lands which now overflow with people. \n\"All this time, Dad had taught Leni how dangerous the outside world was. The truth was that the biggest danger of all was in her own home.\"\nI loved how slowly Kristin Hannah\u2019s story evolved, loved the characters, especially Leni and Large Marge, but I even loved how many unlikeable characters there were in this story, and how they tried to manipulate everyone to believe in their version of the truth. I loved how this touched on the resilience of the human spirit, despite how broken and bruised we may feel or be.Many thanks, once again, to the Public Library system, and the many Librarians that manage, organize and keep it running, for the loan of this book!", "This book is almost one of the best books I have ever read next to where the crawdads sing by delia owens , I'm 100 % sure that I love these kind of books , a coming of age story in a nature setting but don't let the cover trick you it is so much more , so keep in mind that this book has trigger warnings for domestic violence , alcohol abuse,... so make sure to check those out first , seriously guys just read this book it made my heart sing but also made me tear up and furious with anger , 5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50", "Wow! The Great Alone was another captivating story by Kristin Hannah. This was my second book by Hannah, after just finishing The Nightingale and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is about Leni Allbright, an only child and teenage girl whose parents move around frequently to support her dad\u2019s latest and greatest ideas for new ventures. Her father, Ernt, is skeptical of the system, the government, and modernization. He is also a veteran of the Vietnam war and dealing with PTSD which has seriously changed him. Leni\u2019s mom, Cora, puts up with Ernt\u2019s abuse but shields Leni as much as she can, and tries to side with Leni in all situations as she remembers what it was like to be young and crave freedom. The Allbright family moves from Seattle to Alaska when one of Ernt\u2019s fellow soldiers gifts him property there. The story follows their journey North and their attempt to adapt to the harsh frontier and Alaskan wilderness, with minimal modern conveniences. As many other reviews of this book have noted, Hannah\u2019s sweeping descriptions of the Alaskan landscape are wonderful throughout the book. I had no trouble vividly picturing the scenes and this was just another enjoyable element of The Great Alone. \u201cEven with all the pictures Leni had studied and all the articles and books she\u2019d read, she hadn\u2019t been prepared for the wild, spectacular beauty of Alaska. It was otherworldly somehow, magical in its vast expanse, an incomparable landscape of soaring glacier-filled white mountains that ran the length of the horizon, knife-tip points pressed high into a cloudless cornflower-blue sky. Kachemak Bay was a sheet of hammered sterling in the sunlight. Boats dotted the bay. The air smelled briny, deeply of the sea. Shorebirds floated on the wind, dipped and rose effortlessly.\u201dI really liked Leni as a character, but I didn\u2019t care for either of her parents. Ernt was clearly dislikable but I also found Cora to be unlikable, less so than Ernt, yet it was tough to appreciate what I thought were poor choices in her actions for the majority of the book. Leni had to endure so much - a lot for anyone - but especially someone so young. There was a lot of sadness in this story but Leni\u2019s resiliency was admirable. I also loved her love of books, and enjoyed many of the characters of the Allbright\u2019s Alaskan community. \u201dThis state, this place, is like no other. It is beauty and horror; savior and destroyer. Here, where survival is a choice that must be made over and over, in the wildest place in America, on the edge of civilization, where water in all its forms can kill you, you learn who you are. Not who you dreamed of being, not who you imagined you were, not who you were raised to be. All of that will be torn away in the months of icy darkness, when frost on the windows blurs your view and the world gets very small and you stumble into the truth of your existence. You learn what you will do to survive.\u201dHannah is an excellent storyteller. I highly recommend The Great Alone.", "Some plans just have \u201cbad idea\u201d written all over them. This would include Ernt\u2019s plan to take his family to Alaska in 1974. Ernt, a Vietnam vet and ex-POW, is suffering from what we now call PTSD. But back then, there was no diagnosis or treatment. The story is told from the perspective of his daughter, Leni. When they arrive in Alaska, everyone tries to prepare them. To tell them how hard it\u2019s going to be. How one mistake can be fatal. But Leni and her mom, Cora, are desperate to believe that this move will be different and Ernt will be healed by Alaska. Hannah does an amazing job of giving us that sense of foreboding. I just knew whatever was coming was going to be bad even if the family didn\u2019t see it. My first impression was that this reminded me of The Shining. This is a heartbreaking story. But it also made me mad as hell. I wanted to shake Cora, to make her see sense, to make her be a mother first and a wife second. That she would endanger her daughter pissed me off royally. \u201cThere it was: the sad truth. Mama loved him too much to leave him. Still, even now, with her face bruised and swollen. Maybe what she\u2019d always said was true, maybe she couldn\u2019t breathe without him, maybe she\u2019d wilt like a flower without the sunshine of his adoration.\u201dCora might have been weak and broken, but Thelma and Big Marge weren\u2019t. They\u2019re great characters. Strong and not afraid to stand up to the men. This story couldn\u2019t have taken place anywhere but Alaska. The eighteen hour days in summer and eighteen hour nights in winter are key components. The wilderness is totally wild and deadly. Hannah makes you feel you are there. She keeps the tension going throughout the whole book. There was no slump in the middle. It just kept getting ratcheted up and up. And yes, there are parts at the end that don\u2019t stand up to close scrutiny. But not enough for me to rate this anything but 5 stars. A gripping story you won\u2019t want to put down. Highly recommend.

What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back.Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364852559l/16085481.jpg", "title": "Crazy Rich Asians", "authors": "Kevin Kwan", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16085481-crazy-rich-asians", "reviews": ["I am Asian, I lived in Singapore, and I am not crazy rich - but I certainly heard of enough people on that tiny island who are. Ten years ago, I remember being addicted to a blog (now defunct) called \"pinkshoefetish\" where one Daphne Teo of Singapore documented every single materialistic extravaganza in her life - endless Tod's bags, Chanel, the luxurious apartment she (or her parents) rented when she was at Purdue (no stinky student dorms for her), her endless jet-setting to the most expensive hotels and restaurants in New York, London, Paris, etc. At that time, I wasn't even sure I could afford to go to college, so Daphne's blog was pure escapism (if not a source of resentment). I don't remember what her parents did to afford that lifestyle, but anyway, my point is - the crazy rich Asians of East and Southeast Asia do exist, and man do they live large. When I saw that a Singaporean had written a novel about them, and that it was in the hands of a major NYC publishing house, I couldn't wait to read it, to see what had caught the attention of these editors, so much that they were willing to take on a book about Asians, set in Singapore.I got an ARC of the book from eBay and devoured it in two days. And, perhaps I am biased because of who I am and my (slight) exposure to that world, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. It satirizes the crazy rich Asian universe, but even with the exaggerations, my college friend, who is part of the Hong Kong version of the Wealthy Asian Club, would recognize so many aspects depicted in the novel - the lightning speed at which gossip travels, the focus on bloodlines and marriage, the clash between old money and new, and - most important I think - the tension between mainland Chinese and overseas Chinese, a phenomenon that is very real, very common, very much discussed in Asia, but pretty much unheard of in the West. When Singaporean Chinese \"blue blood\" Nick takes his American Chinese girlfriend Rachel home, his family is concerned that, yes, she might be a gold-digger, but their suspicions are heightened by the fact that she was - to their horror - born in mainland China, to a single mother (more strikes against her!). I laughed when I read that, because I was brought up in Asia where those prejudices are part and parcel of everyday life, but an American reader might find it offensive and racist - which it is, but in a \"Chinese\" sort of way that is not so much about hatred. The book shows how those prejudices are challenged as mainland Chinese grow richer and more influential, and the author sympathetically portrays both sides. As for the actual storyline - it's a roller coaster ride that might be hard to keep up with at the beginning because of how many characters are introduced (and I always had my finger on the family tree Kwan provides in the book). I found it ridiculous that Nick and Rachel could have dated for years without her finding out about his background, but this is chick lit and so I willingly suspended disbelief and just let myself get carried along into the world of chili crab and nasi lemak. Kwan's writing is clear and breezy and skips along very well, and in the end I was left feeling like Rachel must have when she was plunked into this whirlwind world - amazed, dizzyfied, enlightened.And it makes me want to go back to Singapore.A great summer read!(Oh - the gold and pink hardcover release is cute, but I love how the galley cover plays with the Herm\u00e8s box design. Clever!)", "\n\"Imagine wanting to marry a girl from such a family! So disgraceful! Really, Nicky, what would Gong Gong say if he was alive? Madri, this tea needs a little more sugar.\"\nThis is some seriously trashy crack-lit. And no that's not a typo-- this book is as addictive and dramatic and ridiculous as you surely imagine it to be. I should probably hate it, but, well... oops.You've definitely got to be in the mood for it or you'll wonder why you're actively murdering your brain cells. And I guess I was definitely in the mood for it. Crazy Rich Asians follows the drama and scandals of some of East Asia's wealthiest families. Think filthy stinking rich: mansions, private planes, $25,000 dresses (I didn't even know such a thing existed), etc. It's opulent, it's melodramatic, and it's completely nuts. This bunch of wealthy families all come together in Singapore for an extravagant fairy tale wedding. But the wedding is the very least of the drama. Nicholas \"Nicky\" Young, who has been living in New York, is about to bring his American-born girlfriend, Rachel Chu, to meet his parents for the first time, and his mother is almost certainly going to dig up some nastiness when she runs a background check on Rachel's family. Also, Rachel has no clue how rich Nicky is-- hell, is she in for a shock!Then there's the beautiful Astrid, whose husband is probably having an affair, and she is about to go investigating to find out. Plus there's a bunch of other subplots about what these ridiculously rich people get up to. It is like the Asian version of all those terrible eighties soap operas like Dallas and Dynasty, and I say \"terrible\" but I totally used to watch reruns of those with my mum, too.I don't know why I liked it; I just did. Maybe it's because I'm nosy and enjoy the drama of other people's lives. Maybe it's because these superficial rich people problems are an enjoyable break from the real world. Maybe it's because it does exactly what it says on the label. Maybe I just have terrible taste. Well, like I said... oops.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "I think another Goodreads reviewer said it best: \"Shallow characters don't mean shallowly written characters.\"And in the case of this book, the author didn't pick up on that memo. Shallow characters can be delightfully, wickedly compelling when they're written well. I mean, look at Anthony and Gloria in Fitzgerald's \"The Beautiful and Damned\", or Becky Sharp in \"Vanity Fair\" or heck, even Blair Waldorf in the \"Gossip Girl\" series if you're looking at more \"chick-lit\" examples. But the characters in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" are so two-dimensional and flat you just can't care about them. Also, a pet peeve of mine is when a writer TELLS me something rather than SHOWS me something. This entire book is all tell, no show. Except to show off the author's knowledge of designer labels. Slow clap.Yes, this is a rather scathing review but I really don't understand all the hype surrounding this book, and I was hoping for more, well, substance (yes, from a glittery gold and hot pinkbook called Crazy Rich Asians, I know. But I think the setting and characters had some originality, timely relevance and promise and the author didn't deliver). Definitely disappointed.", "4.5 stars\n Perfection comes at a sacrifice\n Nick Young (yes, THAT Nick Young) invites Rachel Chu, his longtime girlfriend, to spend the summer in Singapore and attend a wedding of an old friend.Seems pretty simple, right? WRONG! Nick just so happens to be heir to an obscenely large fortune - the kind of rich that are so rich that they don't even acknowledge that they have money. But they do. And they have money and the money they have is a lot. From private jets to houses that are more like palaces, Rachel Chu is about to have a surprise of a lifetime - especially when she meets his family. \n\u201cI criticize you when you\u2019re wearing something that looks so cheap. It\u2019s a disgrace to me.\u201d \n Rachel Chu is so NOT what Eleanor (Nick's mother) expected for her darling son. Rachel is ABC (American-born Chinese), she works for a living and (above all) she's not even rich.So, naturally, Eleanor assumes that Rachel is after Nick's money. And if there's one thing that can be said with absolute certainty, Chinese mothers are not afraid to get their hands dirty to protect their children.\n\u201cYou love your children so much, you do everything to try to protect them, and they don\u2019t even appreciate it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Rachel slowly settles in - becoming friends with Astrid (Nick's cousin and most popular girl on the island) and meets Eddie (another cousin who flaunts his money).As Rachel and Nick adjust to the Singapore society, the sharks are circling.\n\u201cWhat is this, Harry Potter?\u201d Nick sniggered. \u201cThat\u2019s what you just sounded like. Yes, I am aware that even now dark forces are trying to sabotage me.\"\nEvery Singapore girl knows that if Rachel snags a proposal from Nick, there goes their chances with the most eligible bachelor on the island. And if there's one word to describe Singapore girls when they are threatened - it's ruthless.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of being around all these crazy rich Asians,\u201d\nUltimately, I enjoyed this one so much. It was a bit difficult to jump into this book - such a large revolving cast of characters - but once I got the hang of it, I really enjoyed everything about this book. Everyone was obscenely and hilariously rich. Their personalities were so over the top and yet completely believable. Eleanor, in particular, was an absolute hoot. She was that perfect b*tchy mother who \"protected\" her son despite all evidence to the contrary. Rachel's character played well as the straight man of the skit - she felt very down-to-earth without overplaying the \"homegirl\" card. I definitely feel like I would have reacted the same way as she did in just about ever situation. And Nick - with so many vivacious characters around him... he didn't really stand out. I felt somewhat ambivalent towards him - he was sweet, and a bit clueless, but not particularly gripping. I loved all the side plots and petty gossip - there's nothing I love more than a scandal playing out in the juiciest way and this one was no exception. \nHe would never give up trying. He would take an impossible situation and make everything possible.\nIn short - utter brilliance.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!", "This was a really fun read. I went into it with the intention of consuming it just for entertainment purposes and not quality/depth which I think is the best mindset to read this story in. CW: racial slurs, homophobia slurs, talk of cheating, prejudice/classismI did not love the writing style of this novel (which I expected before going in.) The syntax was fairly weak and the voice of individual characters was not that strong. Also regarding the characters, the author has this habit of jumping between perspectives without warning? Each chapter begins with a description of what character point of views will be followed but throughout the chapter, but it changes frequently with no distinction. For example, a conversation may begin from Rachel\u2019s perspective and describe her thoughts and internal reactions but two lines later without any indication, we will be in Astrid\u2019s head. Of course, multiple perspectives are commonly featured in fiction, especially in third-person narratives, but the lack of structure and awareness for the reader was quite jarring and nonsensical. Crazy Rich Asians is absolutely a plot-based series. You read it to follow these unique characters across this absurd journey of wealth, extravagance and drama. I will add that I particularly enjoyed the heavily influence of Chinese and Singaporean culture, albeit the wealthy side of that culture, because it is not something I am frequently exposed to. It\u2019s fun, entertaining, and gripping. I did not expect to be as invested as I was!I\u2019m not particularly taken with many of the characters although I see their individual value to the story. Rachel was obviously the most enjoyable character of the story and I did end up really liking Nick, though I remained furious at how he handled exposing Rachel to his family situation for the entirety of the story. I have sympathy for Astrid and enjoyed the comic relief added by Peik Lin and Charlie. Though this is not the most ground-breaking cast of characters I\u2019ve ever read, I can see myself becoming more invested in their lives as the series progresses.I really enjoyed my time reading Crazy Rich Asians. I initially went into this book thinking I would be satisfied reading just the first installment and not finishing the series, but after finishing, I absolutely need to know where the story goes. If you\u2019re a \u201ctrashy fiction\u201d lover, this book is for you.", "I have no closure.I\u2019m not quite sure what that ending was, but it\u2019s really only an ending by dint of the fact there are no more pages.I was enjoying this book. I could overlook the dull main characters, the hints of family drama and maneuvering that never went anywhere, the randomly dropped storylines \u2026 all of that, I could forgive because, hey, at the end of the day, Crazy Rich Asians is mindless fluff and thinking is contraindicated when reading mindless fluff. This mindless fluff, set among the \u00fcber-wealthy denizens of Singapore, was entertaining.But here\u2019s the thing: part of why I like mindless fluff, part of why I keep reading it despite plot holes and ridiculous, unrealistic twists that drive me nuts, is that I\u2019m guaranteed an ending. An honest-to-goodness (usually happy) ending. This book has no ending. What\u2019s the point of reading mindless fluff without the satisfying conclusion?The \u201cending\u201d is as follows: multiple plotlines left dangling for a cutesy Hollywood-style last shot that solves nothing, two surprisingly nuanced parallel subplots (especially for brain candy) that were slowly built are ignored at a key moment, and some unnecessary melodramatic twists are thrown in over the last few pages rather than diving into the drama and tension built up in the previous 380 pages of the book. No. No. No. No.I hate not having closure. This has to be the set up for a sequel, right? Because that\u2019s the only thing that makes this ending even sort of acceptable (although, even if it is the first of a series, this book needed more in the way of a resolution). Quasi recommended (depends on how you feel about having endings to your stories).ETA: Before informing me that \"there's a sequel!\" please read the date of the review. Also, even having read the sequel, my opinion stands: even individual books in a series need closure.", "Anyone else super excited for the movie to come out?I saw the trailer about a dozen times, and I decided that instead of eating my fingers while waiting for it to hit the cinemas, I would read the book.Best decision ever. This is one of those instances where I recommend reading the book before watching the movie. There is a humongous amount of characters introduced, and so by reading about them first, you\u2019ll be able to spot them more easily in the movie and thus enjoy their crazy personalities more.Though I\u2019m not sure just how much from this first book the movie contains, because those were some packed, juicy four hundred pages. The movie would be ten hours long if everything were included.It's so addictive. There are at least five subplots and, as mentioned, many people to meet. Nick\u2019s mother is, as expected, demanding, but she\u2019s not the only one who disapproves of his girlfriend, Rachel. At least 95% of his entourage want her gone.There\u2019s also Astrid, Nick\u2019s cousin, who is very important in the story. She\u2019s my favourite character. Rachel is very lovely, but her story is rather predictable as opposed to Astrid\u2019s situation. She\u2019s one of those rare rich people who don\u2019t care to boast about the amount of money they possess. It's absolutely unputdownable. A real page-turner.

I just have a blurry patch in my imagination where their face should be, like a blobfish. This is fine when I\u2019m not hyperaware of it, but when there is a fictional individual who is UNCEASINGLY described as SO HANDSOME and DEVASTATINGLY ATTRACTIVE and LETHALLY GOOD-LOOKING and SO PROFOUNDLY WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT THAT HIS VISAGE COULD BEGIN WARS, LIKE A MALE ROM-COM HELEN OF TROY\u2026I start feeling the #fomo*.(*This means \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d for all of you uncultured** ones out there.)(**Uncultured here means \u201csmart and wise enough to not speak in hashtags, and therefore very much better than me.\u201d)But because I watched this movie before reading this book, I was able to picture Henry Golding as this character, and all was right in the world.Although I guess watching the trailer would have had the same effect. But I digress.This was relatively fun and funny. I love reading books that genuinely teach me about cultures that aren\u2019t mine (cough cough, as opposed to \u201cdiverse\u201d books written by white authors in which characters are mentioned as being from different cultures with no actual evidence of such a thing, cough). This was really interesting from that perspective.However, even though this was a relatively short book, it got EXHAUSTING after a while. There is so much drama and gossip and petty hatefulness, and it all just repeats and repeats in a vicious cycle. This inescapable sameness was not helped by the fact that there were 3785975289 minor characters and I did not remember any of them.So overall this was meh.And\u2026Drumroll please\u2026Here comes the controversial opinion\u2026Get those bookworm-cred-revoking hands ready\u2026\u2026Bottom line: The movie was better.-----------yeah sure whatever.READING CHALLENGE HERE I COMEreview to come / 3 stars-----------I'M DOING IT.EVERYONE IGNORE THE FACT THAT I'M DOING IT YEARS TOO LATE AND FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT I'M DOING IT.-----------how to be a bad bookworm:- watch the movie without reading the book- wait 4 months- add the book to your TBR once you can no longer resist hopping on the bandwagon", "1 star (actually half a star but I gave it a bonus half star for a couple of reasons) !!-Writing-just awful--Storyline-started off fair and ended up ridiculous-Dialogue-some of the worst I've ever read-Characters- these are some of the most boring, empty-headed, vile and entitled people ever written aboutWhy the extra bonus half-star?Surprisingly the writer had some talent in writing interesting and lush descriptions of exotic locales, architecture, fashion, cuisine and luxury goods. Believe it or not it was enough to keep me reading.Secondly it was fascinating from a sociocultural perspective although I cannot attest to the accuracy.Crazy Rich Asians was like seeing a fashionable fat drunk woman fall down.....you know you shouldn't keep looking but you just can't help yourself.", "nothing like a bunch of crazy, rich asians to make me feel like a boring, poor white girl. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afgosh, this book is wild. its a story lush in couture, and drama, and private jets, and drama, and more money than one even knows what to do with. oh, and did i mention the drama? its basically high-class catty gossip and i am here for it. such a funny and entertaining story that deserves all the attention its been getting recently! also, i do think its worth mentioning that i saw the film before i read this. and i know i am committing blasphemy by admitting it, but i actually think i prefer the film. not that the book isnt good, i just think that when it comes to a certain level of cattiness and gossip amongst 20+ characters where body language and looks are significant, its much easier to translate across a screen and more effective for the story. it also helps to see a visual of all the luxury to really get an idea of the type of wealth that is exhibited in the novel. so i highly recommend the movie! the book too, but definitely the movie!\u21a0 4 stars", "Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan is a 2013 publication. I guess I missed all the hoopla when this book was first released. It wasn\u2019t until the third book started getting a little buzz that I became interested in reading this series. So, I went in search of this first book- \u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019, and had no trouble finding a copy at the library- but- there was an abnormally long wait period for a book that is four years old! So, this series must be pretty popular!! But, I have lots of books I needed to read, so I didn\u2019t mind waiting, and it helped that once I did get a copy I found myself totally immersed in the saga of these fantastically wealthy Asians, their romantic ups and downs, and their family dramas. Rachel Chu has NO idea what she\u2019s getting herself into when she agrees to attend the wedding of her boyfriend, Nicholas Young\u2019s cousin, Colin, to Araminta Lee. Nick neglects to prepare Rachel for his outrageously rich, and ostentatious family, ignoring dire warnings from some of his family members, to give her a heads up. Nick will soon come to regret throwing Rachel into the mix headlong. Astrid, Nick\u2019s cousin, is an icon of the social pages, who is in a seemingly sweet and successful marriage, but apparently, not all that glitters is gold. This book is a like a light -hearted soap opera and I see how this series could become a guilty pleasure. The cast seems enormous, but there is a sharper focus on Nick and Astrid and their relationship woes. Still, the supporting cast is worth noting- Eddie is Nick\u2019s cousin, who, despite his parents\u2019 lineage and prestige is forced to live beneath the standards of his extended family, which causes him much embarrassment. Eleanor is Nick\u2019s controlling mother, who plots and schemes to keep him from proposing to Rachel. Rachel\u2019s mother, Kerry, gives calm, practical advice, and encouragement, in contrast to Eleanor, but is harboring a volatile secret that could ruin Rachel\u2019s chance at happiness with Nick. There are other supporting players, each with a unique role in the story, all adding a bit more depth to the story. Normally, I struggle with novels featuring a large cast. I get confused easily and lose track of how the characters are connected and often have a hard time understanding what each one has to contribute to the story. But, in this instance, \u2018the more the merrier\u2019 works perfectly. The author skips back and forth among the characters, giving each of them a moment in the spotlight, but mainly the focus is on the possibly doomed romance between Rachel and Nick and the breakdown of Astrid\u2019s marriage due to class differences and the strain of pretending to be someone you aren\u2019t. This book is pure chick-lit, but with such vivid, hilarious, and outrageously over the top characters, it was never too heavy on the drama. The author did a terrific job of showing the differences in generations- the old customs and versus the more relaxed exposure to western customs- the class divisions- the effect wealth has on those who are born into it as opposed to those who worked to achieve it. The language is authentic, which required some footnotes the author graciously provided. I enjoyed learning about this culture in such a fun and easy way, although it does slow down the momentum, just a little bit. Overall, this novel turned out to be more than I had anticipated, and I\u2019m glad I discovered this series. I\u2019m looking forward to the next installment and can not wait to see what these crazy rich Asians will get up to next!!", "\u201dAnd so this exotic strain of gossip spread rapidly through the Levantine networks of the Asian jet set, and within a few hours, almost everyone in this exclusive circle knew that Nicholas Young was bringing a girl home to Singapore. And, alamak! This was big news.\u201dI guess this quote is the perfect summary of the entire book. *lol* And yes, the title already tells us everything we need to know. Still, I expected something light and fluffy when I started to read \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d but truth be told I was kinda thrown by the intense and serious turn this book took in the end. There happened quite some heavy stuff and this is probably the biggest understatement ever!! XDOh well, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself here so let\u2019s start at the beginning. Rachel and Nicholas have been in a solid relationship for two years and his best friend\u2019s wedding is actually the main reason he\u2019s taking his girlfriend with him. I mean he\u2019s Colin\u2019s best man so it\u2019s only natural to take your long-time girlfriend with you, right? Yes and no! Because seriously, nothing and no one could have prepared them for what would happen when they set their feet on this island. XD It\u2019s not only a clash of cultures but also some sort of grim war between two seemingly different classes of people. If there ever exists such a thing. Just because some people think they are better and superior this certainly doesn\u2019t make them better and superior. Which already brings me to the first topic that got me really riled whenever I read this book:The audacity and obnoxious snobbery of Nick\u2019s family and their \u201cclose\u201d friends. Money can buy you a lot of things but it obviously can neither buy you a heart nor common sense! \u201dAnd unlike Leo, Eddie\u2019s parents were the old-fashioned type \u2013 insisting from the moment Eddie graduated that he learn to live off his earnings. It was so bloody unfair.I had no, I repeat absolutely, no sympathy or compassion for \u201cpoor\u201d Eddie. It must have been so damn hard just to have a big house instead of a villa or to have a small private jet instead of a huge luxury airplane. If you ask me those people are really rich and truly crazy. There are people starving in this world, there are people that don\u2019t even have a place to call their home and all those rich spoilt brats cared about was their designer clothes, their food and how they could look better than the rest. Urgh! I know I\u2019m taking this way too serious, but as a person who grew up in a hardworking family that had to work for every cent and never got anything for free I just lack sympathy for people like them. And therefore the list of the people I didn\u2019t like in this book is as long as the equator. Probably even longer because to circle the entire world only once might not be enough. XDSo just to give you a short example: Eleanor, Bernard, Eddie, Lorena, Carol, Lauren, Francesca, Evan, Roderick, Wandi, Parker, Nadine, Jacqueline, Su Yi (aka Ah Ma), Alexandra, \u2026 and the list could go on and on!Thankfully there are also people that I liked and that made up for the horrible snobbery of those others: Rachel, Nick, Astrid, Colin, Sophie, Peik Lin and all the Gohs in general, Alistair, Philip and Charlie. And maybe Oliver, but I really dunno what\u2019s his angle in all of this. *lol*\u201dOh, you really don\u2019t have to do that. It\u2019s not important to me what sort of family he comes from,\u201d Rachel said.\u201cNonsense, lah! Of course it\u2019s important!\u201d Wye Mun was adamant. \u201cIf he\u2019s Singaporean, I have a responsibility to make sure he\u2019s good enough for you!\u201dI wish Nick\u2019s family would have seen it the same way because the way they treated Rachel was just horrible and mean! I think the biggest disappointment was Su Yi though. I really thought she would know better than her spoilt grandchild Eddie! Especially because if I got it correctly she\u2019s only filthy rich because she inherited the money from her father and actually didn\u2019t have to do anything to gain her wealth. \u201dWhere she\u2019s from is irrelevant. My youngest grandson is not going to marry some actress, especially one of questionable lineage,\u201d Su Yi said simply. Turning to Alexandra, she said, \u201cYou will tell him to break off the engagement immediately.\u201dBut every time I thought \u201cOH GODS, YOU CAN\u2019T BE SERIOUS!!!\u201d some nice character made an appearance and I started to believe in the good in people again. *lol* Two of the best examples were definitely Nick and Charlie because boy those two men blew me away! And truth be told even Fiona showed some serious backbone when she defended her kids against their tyrant of a father! =) \u201dWho exactly are you trying to impress? The photographers? The readers of Hong Kong Tattle? You really care so much about them that you\u2019d rather hit your own son over an accident that you caused in the first place by screaming at him for wearing the wrong cummerbund?\u201dAnd so it happens that events escalate and almost everything that can go wrong actually goes wrong in the end. I can\u2019t even tell you how sorry I felt for Nick! I mean, yeah he was partly responsible for the things that happened but you can\u2019t blame him for only thinking the best of his mum and grandma. I mean they are his family and they hurt him at least as much as they hurt Rachel. Up until the moment he realized what they did behind his back he was actually pretty clueless about their vindictive ways and the lengths to which they would go in order to keep him from marrying Rachel.\u201dShe\u2019s not something I can just give up, Mum. I love her, and I\u2019m going to marry her. I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval,\u201d Nick said forcefully, rising from the table.\u201cStupid boy! Ah Ma will disinherit you!\u201d\u201cLike I care.\u201d\u201dNo, Rachel, please don\u2019t go,\u201d Nick said, grabbing her by the arm. \u201cI need you to hear this. Ah Ma, I don\u2019t know what stories you\u2019ve been told, but I have met Rachel\u2019s family, and I like them very much. They have certainly shown me a great deal more courtesy, warmth, and respect than our family has shown to Rachel.\u201dPoor Nick, poor Rachel! They both didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that! I felt really sorry for Rachel because her world was turned upside down, but to some degree I felt even more sorry for Nick because it was his own family that did all this stuff. Your family should be the people you can rely on and trust, your family should be the people that catch you when you fall and his family, well they hurt him because he wanted to marry the \u201cwrong\u201d kind of girl. (view spoiler)[And if this wouldn\u2019t have been enough already Rachel even broke up with him because she couldn\u2019t stand to see him anymore. He so didn\u2019t deserve that!! I swear if Rachel wouldn\u2019t have turned to him in the end I really would have thrown that book out of my window! *lol* YES! I felt that strongly about poor Nick\u2019s misery!!! (hide spoiler)]Conclusion:\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d was an interesting, unexpectedly intense and somehow educational book. It kept me entertained and forced me to read on because I always wanted to know what would happen next. Rachel and Nick were a great couple and I\u2019m already curious about the second book. As it seems it\u2019s not only about them but also about Nick\u2019s cousin Astrid as well and after her encounter with her ex-boyfriend Charlie I\u2019m really beyond excited to see where this is heading. Because let\u2019s face it: As much as I liked Nick, Charlie is still the best!!!! <3(view spoiler)[\u201dIf he didn\u2019t have a chance of getting Astrid back, he at least wanted to try to help her. He wanted her to find love again with her husband. He wanted to see the joy return to Astrid\u2019s face, that glow he had witnessed all those years ago at the bonfire on the beach. He wanted to pass it on.\u201dImma gonna die if they don\u2019t end up together and she actually goes back to Michael!!!! ARAHAKSDFASDFJASDKFJADSKF! Charlie is precious!! So damn precious that I can\u2019t even! <333 If Astrid doesn\u2019t take him, I will! *lol* (hide spoiler)]________________________________I don't know what this book is about but I'm going to make a wild guess here and will claim that it's about....Wait for it...Crazy, rich, Asians!?!Am I, right!? *lol*And because I'm a psychic too, I'll just add a little drama and romance to it as well. \ud83d\ude1cI'm sure this is going to be a fast and funny read! So whoever recommended it to me: Thanks! \ud83d\ude0a I'm looking forward to this adventure. XD Here I go with another book on My Book List 2019!", "3.5 stars rounded to 4I'm amazed at how long it has taken me to pick up this book. I remember being intrigued when it was first published; I had my own adventure in Singapore in 2004, which peaked my interest even more but, for whatever reason, it took the film adaptation being released to finally convince me to read it before seeing the movie. It was precisely what I had hoped for, a fun, fluffy read full of delectable \"gossip\" and drama, and to top it off the diversity of an all asian cast to boot. While it did feel a bit long for a fluffy read, it was kind of nice having a book on the side that I could pick up and put down as I felt lead; truly the perfect read to fill in between the gaps of heavier and darker stories. I laughed a lot, and I keep finding that I'm needing that more and more in my reading line up, but I also think this was due to the narrator's fabulous job of portraying the large cast in unique, individual ways. Although I'm unsure why the following two audible books in the series have a different narrator? At the end of the day, this was a fun read that gives us a sneak peak into the lives of Asia's crazy rich folks and their over the top lifestyles. ----------Buddy read with Irina Humphrey, even though she already saw the movie. *Sipping my tea*", "From http://iknowwhatyoushouldread.wordpre...Lest you be confused, this is not a book about crazy [comma] rich Asians. This is a book about crazy rich Asians. As in, stupidly, stupidly wealthy gazillionaire Asians. I had read an excerpt in Vogue, and it seemed like it might be good, fun summer reading, filled with fashion and snobbery and such. I am a lover and regular devourer of US Weekly, who loathes the fact that I do not come from a ton of old money, so this seemed right up my alley.When I got the e-book, however, I knew immediately that I\u2019d been swindled. Before I had even begun reading, the book had two strikes against it:Strike 1: it starts with a family tree, andStrike 2: it has endnotes.I just can\u2019t get excited about a book that begins with a family tree. Now, before you get all up in arms and point out all the delightful and amazing books that begin with a family tree, I will admit that this is not a hard-and-fast rule. But my general opinion is that a book\u2019s cast of characters should not be so convoluted that it requires a visual aid (one of the reasons I am content to stick with the television version of Game of Thrones, thank you very much). Plus, when you\u2019re reading an e-book, it\u2019s a huge hassle to have to refer back to the family tree. So, I audibly groaned when I discovered that this book has one. It\u2019s a book about rich people. How complicated can it be? But the Crazy Rich Asians family tree is kind of catty and fun, so I decided to keep an open mind. The endnotes aren\u2019t a deal-breaker here, either. Normally, I hate them because they break up the flow of my reading. Also, they make me feel like I\u2019m back in law school. And, too often, they\u2019re used for cutesy purposes, which is nearly impossible to do well. That said, e-books make them slightly more tolerable, because you can just click on the endnote and it magically appears (constant page flipping in a \u201creal\u201d book is just too much). And these endnotes in particular aren\u2019t bad, because they are in large part: 1) translations of Hokkein and Malay words and phrases and 2) descriptions of Singaporean foods. I\u2019m a foreign languages nerd and a lover of delicious foods, so I didn\u2019t hate the endnotes.But all of that doesn\u2019t matter. Because, family tree and endnotes aside, I still didn\u2019t like the book. Here are three more strikes against it:Strike 3: It\u2019s too damn long (over 400 pages). The book is about a couple (Rachel and Nick) who are both profs at NYU and have been together for two years. Nick is going home to Singapore for his best friend\u2019s wedding and asks Rachel to come with him. Despite the fact that they\u2019ve been together for two years, Rachel knows nothing about Nick\u2019s background and family and friends (it comes as a complete surprise to her that his family is crazy rich). Shocking excess and extravagance ensue. And (not even remotely a spoiler, because the book is so ridiculously predicatable) Nick\u2019s mother and grandmother try to break Nick and Rachel up. WHY DOES THIS NECESSITATE 400 PAGES? It doesn\u2019t.Strike 4: People have described this as an amazing, hilarious satire. Basically, the book tries to make fun of crazy rich Asians, by showing that they\u2019re snobby and elitist and old-fashioned. Well, I\u2019m sorry, but my grandmother was not a crazy rich Asian (she was just a plain-old crazy Asian), and she was every bit as snobby, elitist, and old-fashioned as the grandmother in this book. The author manages to paint a picture of the fashion and houses and such that is completely over-the-top, but his characters are flat, flat, flat. They just weren\u2019t well developed enough to make you give a shit.Strike 5: The plot is boring and predictable.Rating: 2/5 ", "This book is deliciously entertaining.\u00a0Rachel is a professor of economics in NY who has been dating her boyfriend Nick for two years. One day Nick invites her to go with him to Singapore to attend his cousin's wedding and she agrees.As soon as Rachel and Nick arrive at Singapore and meet his\u00a0family, she realizes that Nick's family is filthy rich. Not just wealthy but $200,000-a-dress wealthy and this is a fact that he's failed to disclose to her.Rachel\u00a0soon finds herself dealing with nosy relatives, sumptuous\u00a0meals, scheming social climbers, private jets, and drama, tons of drama. The novel is narrated from different points of view and is set mostly in Asia. My favorite character is Oliver because he is witty and a shameless schemer.\u00a0The novel is funny, interesting and addictive.\u00a0Overall I enjoyed it and plan to read the sequels.\u00a0FINAL NOTE: a movie adaptation is in the works and encompasses an all-Asian cast. I am excited to see the movie and was happy to learn that Michelle Yeoh will be playing one of the main characters Eleanor Sung-Young. I first saw her on the amazing movie\u00a0Crouching Tiger,\u00a0Hidden Dragon and have\u00a0been a fan ever since.UPDATE 8/20/18: Just watched the movie and it was AMAZINGLY GOOD. Loved it!!!", "With Crazy Rich Asians hitting the big screens in a few short weeks, many readers have decided to re-read this 2013 release \u2013 or, as in my case, have finally decided to read it. This, of course, has also been reflected not only in social media trends but on the New York Times bestseller list where Kevin Kwan\u2019s debut novel has again easily nabbed a spot, despite having been originally released five years ago. I, myself, fell casualty to an impulse all book lovers are prone to: buying a book because of its cover! I bought a copy of Crazy Rich Asians when it was first released because the sparkly gold cover drew my eye \u2013 and my wallet, apparently \u2013 like a magpie to all that glitters. So, when I put out the poll last month for which book I should read next, I was glad that this one won (by a LANDSLIDE, mind you) because I already had a shiny copy with an in-tact spine on my shelves ready to read!Crazy Rich Asians is exactly what you\u2019d expect with such a loud and gaudy title and the sparkly cover to match. The gist of the novel is that the ultra hunky Nicholas Young falls in love with Rachel Chu and decides to bring her to Singapore for his best friend\u2019s wedding of the century event to introduce her to his folks\u2026and all of the lavishness that comes with it. Rachel, having never known her beau was FILTHY RICH is shocked by what she finds\u2014and the viciousness of his family and friends\u2014toward her when she arrives. A series of comical events ensues over this few weeks, which we, the readers, are privy to.The first thing you\u2019ll notice, from page one, is that Crazy Rich Asians is ALL THE WAY OVER THE TOP as if Kwan just threw every lavish thing he could think of in there, including the deluxe, chef-grade kitchen sink! But, isn\u2019t that what we picked this novel up for \u2013 a fun, feisty read that can be enjoyed simply for the setting and hilarity of it. This book was \nsoaked\n in Asian culture, which was an added bonus I absolutely loved\u2014from the Hokkien and Mandarin slang littered throughout the pages (thanks, Kwan, for the footnotes!) to the description of native dishes and cultural values. The scale of wealth, customs and rituals Kwan shows us is larger than life in all the most uproarious ways. Of course, let\u2019s be honest here: a novel like this is bound to be a bit over-embellished, like biting into a too-sweet Godiva chocolate bar, and that it was. But I enjoyed that bit of decadence; in that way, this book really lived up to its name \u2013 and the hype! I will say that there were WAY too many POVs and unnecessary story lines here, which certainly contributed to the extravagant and superfluous page count. At times, pages upon pages were spent just describing the luxuriousness of these characters\u2019 surroundings. In a single paragraph you\u2019ll find references like: Venus de Milo, Battenberg lace tablecloth, and Louis Quatorze chairs in royal blue brocade. (And I found that by flipping to any random page lol.) Yet, to go along with this over-the-top style of writing\u2014that we\u2019ve all come to love enough to want to go see the film about it\u2014the dialogue within these pages was always light and realistic, outrageous and totally hilarious. Yes, the ending was sopped in melodrama, like a Taiwanese soap opera, and rushed, as if Kwan suddenly realized he was over or nearing the 400-page mark for this novel and suddenly decided to STOP and continue on with it in book two. BUT, in the end, Crazy Rich Asians delivered all that it promised: the humor and the fun along with the crazy, the rich and the Asians. And for that, I serve up on a Harry Winston platter 4 sparkly, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera-covered stars! ****FOLLOW ME HERE:Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Get a Copy of My Book | Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me ", "A pick-your-own-poison type of lit:> Satirical> Vapid> Shallow> Ridiculous> Fun> Twisty> Trashy> Tacky> Sweet> Soap-operish dramaI've learned more from this one about fashion than I've ever considered wanting to know.Q:Thank you Lord Jesus for the fellowship that we shared today, for the nourishing food we enjoyed, for the power of your holy word.

Basically, according to this book, all rich people in Singapore are snobbish and bad human beings. They can\u2019t even see beyond their rich way of thinking when a down-to-earth person approaches them and tries to make them see things from a different perspective. Actually, what they do instead (according to this novel) is to turn that down-to-earth person into someone who actually enjoys the crazy life style of jet planes, mansions, designer dresses and yachts because \u201cno woman or man can ever really turn that down\u201d. Furthermore, everyone\u2019s wealth is illustrated in EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER from start to finish, and while it was fascinating to read about in the beginning, it became pretty redundant towards the middle and intolerable in the end. The characters\u2019 view on life really put a sour taste in my mouth, together with the fact that the plot and everyone\u2019s decisions didn\u2019t make any sense. I gradually became more and more frustrated with everyone and everything instead of finding the humour and relaxing fun in it that so many people seem to have found. All in all, what makes me give this book the lowest rating is its message which is, honestly, ugly and depressing: Money solves everything, and even though you don\u2019t think you really want it, you do. Urgh! Mix that together with a bird that taps on your window in the morning to provide you with the solution to all of your problems as well as a rotten fish in your room - that\u2019s \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d for you. ", "This is soap opera light literature. It\u2019s fun and easy, a beach read. However, someone picked this for our book club, and I\u2019m wondering what the hell there is to discuss. While Nick is an only child, this book encompasses his extended family. Keeping track of all the names and relationships can be a bit of a challenge. I almost wanted a scorecard. Nick works as a history professor in the States. Most of his family either doesn\u2019t work or \u201cworks\u201d for the family business and one of the interesting points is how the different characters handle their wealth and to what extent they feel entitled. Think Dynasty or Dallas for the 21st century. It\u2019s materialism taken to the nth degree; like a house with a living room designed to recreate Versailles Hall of Mirrors. Or closets with different temperatures. Who knew leather needed it\u2019s own temp control? And I admit to being so out of it that I didn\u2019t even recognize half the brand labels. This is a fast read. There are some laugh out loud moments. A lot of groans. Kwan has a definite tongue in cheek style. But like eating a dessert that\u2019s too sweet, a little bit of this goes a long way. By the end, I admit I was skimming over some of the more decadent descriptions. But like sugar, there is also an addictive quality to this book. I kept picking this book up, reading just a bit more, anxious to see how it ends. And therein lies one of the problems. I know this is the first book in a trilogy, but most of the stories are left hanging. You really get no sense of how they will end. Which couples will get to live happily ever after? You\u2019ll need to read book two and I wasn\u2019t enthralled enough to invest the additional hours. ", "\nFun and dishy. So over the top it becomes nauseating in the way of such books. It's just too much. A parodic parody.\n", "\nThey are crazy and they are rich. That is pretty much all I got out of it. 10% in and I can't stand to read any more of this vapid book. Somehow it was not the guilty pleasure I was looking for. Returning it back to the library.\n", "After being briefly obsessed with the Gossip Girl book series in high school, and then the show a few years later (and then abandoning it once Georgina reappeared with Dan's baby god that show was trash and I loved it), this seemed like the next logical step. Crazy Rich Asians is Kevin Kwan trying his hand at the ever-popular genre that can best be summed up as \"hey look, rich people!\" The fact that the rich people featured here are all based in Singapore, rather than America or Europe, gave the book an interesting dimension and gives Kwan a chance to (briefly) touch on deeper issues of prejudice and toxic social norms within the rich Singaporean community. Our heroine is Rachel Chu, an economics professor who gets invited to spend a few months in Singapore with her boyfriend of two years, Nicholas Young. It seems to be a perfectly normal trip: Nick's best friend is getting married, and he wants to bring Rachel home to attend the wedding and meet his family. Once the couple arrives, however, Rachel gradually realizes that Nick hasn't been completely honest about the circumstances of their trip - Nick, it turns out, is part of one of the richest families in Asia, and the wedding they're attending is going to be one of the most expensive events in recent memory. Also Nick's grandmother lives in an estate (that's hidden even on Google maps) where she's waited on by two lady's maids and protected by armed guards. This is a world where women get together for Bible study to trade stock tips and compare their latest jewelry purchases, where Nick's cousin takes a trip to Paris every year to buy herself a new couture wardrobe, and a bachelorette weekend involves jetting off to a private island in Indonesia owned by the bride's mother.In short: wealth porn. Dirty, nasty, xxx wealth porn. At his best, Kwan is giving us a poor man's Bride and Prejudice (the movie that is, itself, a poor man's Pride and Prejudice) - in short, a cheap knockoff of a cheap knockoff. He's trying very hard for an Austen-like feel, in all the scenes where Rachel is scrutinized and gossiped about by everyone in Nick's family, who are all determined not to let him get further involved with someone they think is beneath him. One of the best scenes, that comes closest to the kind of story I think Kwan is trying to write, has Rachel listening in awe as a group of women kindly tell their friend that it's not even worth her time to marry a man worth only a few millions - and then they proceed to itemize all of her future expenses, from country club fees to private school tuition, to illustrate why this millionaire is too poor to support her lifestyle. Moments like these, that provide realistic glimpses into the world of the super-rich, are the best part of the book, but there aren't many of them.This story got repetitive very quickly. First, Kwan's descriptions of the luxury Rachel witnesses don't vary much, so you end up reading a lot of lines about \"the most delicious dessert Rachel had ever eaten\" and \"the biggest house Rachel had ever seen\" and \"the most luxurious this\" and \"the most expensive that.\" After a while, your eyes just sort of glaze over. Another problem was that I quickly realized that there are only three kinds of scenes in this book, and Kwan just keeps repeating them with different characters and settings. Scene 1: Rachel and/or Nick go to some fancy location so the reader can gawk at the luxury along with the characters. Scene 2: Characters talk about how awful Rachel is, and trade gossip we've already heard. Scene 3: a side character has a scene unrelated to Rachel, Nick, or the main plot. Two of Nick's cousins each have their own subplot in this book, and both storylines don't really go anywhere interesting - but I guess that's what the sequels are for. The ending was kind of jarring, too, because it was a completely different tone from the rest of the book. While most of Crazy Rich Asians is a fluffy romp through Rich People Land, with some fun backstabbing and gossip to keep things interesting, the last few chapters take a hard left turn into Harrowing Family Dramaville, and it suddenly turns into a bad Joy Luck Club knockoff. And it happens way, way too late in the story, so the book is over before we get a chance to adjust to the new tone - it never worked for me, and I suspect Kwan did it because he couldn't think of another way to end the book. So overall, I was lukewarm on this one. But apparently there's going to be a movie version, and I'm excited about it for two reasons. First, I read somewhere that Constance Wu from Fresh Off the Boat is going to play Rachel, which is perfect - Rachel is kind of dull in the book, but she has flashes of sass and strength that Wu will be able to bring out. No idea who they're getting to play Nick, but he'd better be just oozing charisma, because Book Nick is basically a cardboard cutout that character tote around and prop up during scenes. I'm also really excited to see this movie because I think this story is much more suited to a visual format - if we can just see the exotic, luxurious locations, that's better than having to sit through Kwan's dull descriptions. Plus, this book is so light on actual plot that they could probably condense it down to ninety minutes and wouldn't lose much.", "I\u2019ve shared this story before - many times. Just not in a review. I met the author -Kevin Kwan when he first wrote this book. He was great! I took my signed physical book home - sure I\u2019d enjoy the book. I wasn\u2019t enjoying the characters or the drama - so I tossed it aside.A couple years later - everybody was reading this book. I started seeing raving reviews. So I picked up my book to read again\u2026 And I had the same problemJust not crazy about CRAZY RICH ASIANS.......AS A BOOK.....SO....I TRIED AUDIOBOOK..MY 3rd attempt!I downloaded the library Audiobook - nope - still never made it to the end. By now I knew the characters better, though. But the whole premises bored me.THEN....I saw the movie....and LOVED IT! REALLY LOVED IT! But - no - I\u2019m not going to try a 4th time to read the book. I\u2019m dropping my copy off at \u201cThe little Library\u201d box a few houses down. That\u2019s it - done! No interest in reading the follow up books either. I still think the author is a great guy though! Glad he has many reading fans. I bring this review & my gut truths forward today ..... d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu..... as I\u2019m having the same \u2018so so\u2019 experience with another book I\u2019m about to DNF....EXPECT TO SEE *TWO* DNF books from me today....Same problems are showing up for me in: \u201cFamily Trust\u201d, by Kathy Wang.In BOOK FORM... sarcasm and stereotyping just kind of gets to me and I don\u2019t feel the sincerity enough. I'm discovering that qualities I enjoy and movies are not always the same qualities I enjoy in books. I had the same problems with \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d, by Celeste Ng, ......( everyone seemed to love the book more than I did)But in that case I did finish it......and still rated it 4 stars, for excellent writing.I\u2019m guessing I\u2019ll enjoy the MOVIE of LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE *more*.It\u2019s me - not others - not the books- I\u2019m not a big Bill Bryson fan either..... there are some types of humor/sarcasm/stereotyping\u2026 That I don\u2019t enjoy as much as others. Thanks for reading this vent if you did....Now to write one more DNF review. Not complaining- I mean no problem for me if I don\u2019t like a book - I know it happens - and moving on gets easier to do for me today. I no longer feel the need to stay with any book I want to drop for any reasonMaybe this is just another step of learning in my own \u2018late bloomer\u2019 reading experience. I trust \u2018myself\u2019 more today to be able to let a book go than I did when I was more of a newbie die hard reader. It\u2019s READING that taught me this lesson.....\u201cI\u2019ll keep reading until the day I die, but I can also let some books go, too\u201d!", "The movie version of Crazy Rich Asians was so good it gave me chills. It had EVERYTHING: hot men, amazing costumes, comedy, romance, and an ending that I was squealing over. So, of course, as a die-hard bookworm, I assumed the book would be even better. I was wrong. The style of the book really didn't work for me. So many POV changes and over-the-top drama. I felt like I was reading a soap opera, and soap operas aren't my thing. It lacked the humor of the movie, the stunning visual effects of the movie, and the wow-factor of the movie. It just wasn't the same. In this case, film wins, as painful as that is to admit.goodreads|instagram|twitter|blog", "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Words cannot express how much excite I have for the upcoming film version of this book - but this gif does a pretty decent job : )\n\nRachel Chu has NOOOOOO idea what she\u2019s getting into when she agrees to accompany her boyfriend Nick to his best friend\u2019s wedding in Singapore.

Ugh \u2013 BITCHES!). Kevin Kwan really knows his opulence, and his descriptions of the lavish lifestyles of the various characters left me sometimes drooling in envy and sometimes ready to gag for the gaudiness. A remarkable debut novel with a cast of (pretty well-developed) characters as long as my arm. 4 Stars because I\u2019m greedy with my 5-Star ratings and the last 100 pages lost a little of the mojo that had propelled the first three-quarters of the book.", "\nCrazy Rich Asians is part satire, part romance, part family drama, part Mean Girls, and 100% entertaining.

It is the first installment in a series by the same name and I am excited to continue. Check it out!! My favorite quote:\"There is nothing in the world that good food cannot fix.\"\n", "\n\nInstagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestHi, let me tell you about this book. It was SO good and I say that honestly (#NotSponsored). But seriously, you know that I'm not afraid to take the utter piss out of an over-hyped book (see anything I've reviewed by Sarah J. Maas), so when I read something like this and say it's awesome, please know that I have absolutely no reason to lie. CRAZY RICH ASIANS is crazy good.So what's it about? Well, the story itself isn't that original. We've all read and watched rags-to-riches chicklit, whether it's DEVIL WEARS PRADA (book or movie) or that mid-2000s classic, What a Girl Wants. There is something very satisfying about watching Jane Everygirl soar up the class system, sticking her nose up (very good sportsmanship-like, of course) at the people who oppressed and snubbed her when she was just a humble pleb. This is a story that nobody gets sick of. We, as a society, eat this story up like it's a nacho-cheese drizzled tray of curly fries at the fairgrounds.No, what makes this story special is that it takes this tried-and-true formula and it sets it in Asia. And before you say, \"What, what about MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA?\" No, White Person (because you probably are a white person if this is your rallying cry). That is different, because MEMOIRS was written by a white dude from a white dude's perspective of what Asia is like. And as much as I enjoy that book (I did, guiltily), there is something vastly different about a book written by someone who is only observing a culture through secondary sources and someone who has experienced it firsthand, and is writing not just based on their observations but also based on what they, personally, experienced from within.Rachel Chu is a likable, intelligent, girl-next-door type professor of Economics who has been dating her fellow professor/Singaporean boyfriend for two years. When one of his old chums is engaged to be married, Rachel is invited to accompany him back to Singapore as a guest of the wedding, but also to meet the fam. She's excited - THIS IS THE BIG NEXT STEP - but also a little afraid. Nick, her boyfriend, has never said much to her about his family before, and this worries her. And she should be worried, because they are basically the Carnegies of Asia. They have their fingers in all the pineapple pies, and want nothing to do at all with Rachel, the gold-digging interloper (in their minds).What follows is several hundreds of pages of drama, running the gamut of conspicuous consumption and materialism, cheating and adultery, cruel hazing, superficiality, gossip-mongering, family drama, abuse, lies, and MORE. It should have been vapid, what with all of the name-dropping of luxury products and jet-setting, but it wasn't. The only other author who I've read that was able to do this \"ennui of the rich and famous\" style of writing was Jackie Collins, and based on what I've read thus far, Kevin Kwan is basically the Asian Jackie Collins, which was incredibly refreshing, because there are only so many times that you can read about rich white people living it up in London, New York, and Los Angeles, before you start to feel a little, well, bored.Rachel is a really likable character and except at the end, when she starts blaming her mother for something that wasn't really her fault, I was constantly rooting for her and Nicky. I loved Astrid, Nick's troubled and gorgeous socialite cousin. I liked Peik Lin, Rachel's conveniently rich BFF (and advocate). I loved Rachel's Mom, Kerry, and her backstory at the end nearly broke my heart and left me teary-eyed. It just goes to show how much mothers will sacrifice for their children. That said, the only thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of closure. The book ends in a very inconvenient and unfinished spot (probably because there are two sequels), but it feels very anticlimactic since things are never really squared with Eleanor, Nick's scheming snobby mother, Francesca, the resident mean girl, and also between Nick and Rachel themselves, who are a constant will they/won't they? This was very disappointing and I felt like it wasn't fair to the reader. It wasn't fair to ME.I desperately need to find out what happens next. The two sequels are already on hold at the libs.4 to 4.5 stars", "Content Warnings:-Racial slurs toward black people, Indian people, Romani people. (Used casually by the \"likeable\" main characters as well as the ones we're supposed to hate.)-Slurs toward gay people.-One scene depicting a graphic dog fight (chapter 9).-One instance of a father threatening violence toward a child.-Cheating is a major theme throughout.-Classism (that's probably obvious).-Lots of prejudice from and toward different Asian ethnicities. I'm not saying any of these things are unrealistic of anyone's experience within social circles like this, I'm just pointing them out for anyone who may be hurt by these topics and wish to avoid.I can't personally speak to the Singaporean and Chinese representation but I did enjoy having this peek into these characters lives. I think you'd like this if you enjoy soapy dramas and miscommunication. The thing I least enjoyed was the constant cattiness of the women. The female characters were all so competitive and judgmental of each other. This can certainly be realistic but I think it hit me the wrong way since this was written by a man. It seemed quite sensationalized.Personally, I didn't find this fluffy or romantic at all. I spent the entire book being angry at Nick for throwing Rachel into this situation with no preparation. He and other male characters have the mentality that they know what a woman wants better than the woman herself does and not taking no for an answer. There was a lack of depth, especially in Nick's character, that meant I didn't care about their relationship at all. Their supposed romance was all telling and no showing. I wish the story had focused more on Nick and Rachel so that we could get more invested in them.Despite these things, it was still enjoyable and I've requested the sequel. I'm excited about the movie.Audiobook: In one or two places I noticed that the book would say a character was shouting but the narrator would read the dialogue in a calm voice.

Because I felt that.I didn't expect to tear through this book, but I did\u2014there was just so much restlessness in my reading, an urgency to reach the ending. It\u2019s been days and I am still so keenly, strangely, extensively aware of explosions still taking place inside my head. Honestly? If Hollywood doesn't turn this into a movie....I will personally riot.\n\nSo, what's this book about?\n\nOur narrator wakes up in a dripping forest, with nothing but the shade of an old unnameable fear, and the eerie sensation of being followed, an invisible gaze locked on his back. He has no recollection of who he is, and he has no more notion how he got there than he did the moon. But his head is firing thought after thought that can\u2019t seem to complete themselves and they all begin with a name: Anna, and never seem to end.He later learns that his name is Aiden Bishop and he\u2019s trapped inside a stranger\u2019s body. A masked figure curtly informs him that he must unveil a murder disguised as to not look like one if he wants to earn his release, and he must do so by reliving the day of the murder eight times, but each morning he will wake up in the body of a foreign soul. If he fails to uncover the name of the would-be murderer, he will return to the first day, memory moped clean, and start all over again as he has apparently already done innumerable times before.Matters are made worse when Aiden realizes he isn\u2019t the only one carried so long here and there on a stream and washed now to this strange shore: two other people are also ensnarled inside this time loop, and a knife-wielding Footman is out for their blood.Aiden, Anna and the anonymous rivals are pieces on the game board, and there is everything at stake.\n\u201cHow lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?\u201d\u00a0\nNormalcy has its place, but you won't find it in this book.The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a dazzling, mind-bending murder mystery\u2026without a murder. It\u2019s a locked-room thriller with a nearly imperceptible warp wavering in its center. A brilliantly balanced knife's edge of a book\u2014unfolding gradually but deliberately, with secrets unveiled as more lies are told. Every sentence was a labyrinth to navigate and my mind often felt like a door blown open in a storm. The whole experience of reading this book felt like an elaborate lie to me, some made-up fantasyland I was locked in for a set number of hours a day. And like Aiden, every moment, I was caught between another dead end and another lead. So many pieces of the story but how the hell do they fit together?In richness of ideas, and in glory of sentences, this book is spectacular. I was deeply impressed by the sense of scope, the minute turnings of characters and their choices and how those ripples affect other players, by the hints strewn like breadcrumbs throughout the narrative and the puzzle pieces that were constantly moving around. This was genuinely brilliant and so intricately crafted and I\u2019m still left marveling at how one person\u2019s brain can contain multitudes.The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\u00a0might be focused on the story of Aiden Bishop but the stories of many others are caught up in the wheel of his, and as that wheel turns, so do these many intertwined lives and fates. The narration lingers in the memories and lives of each \u201chost\u201d, dipping in and out of them like toes in a pool. The book makes you question what you know about these characters, their lives and their secrets. Everyone is unreliable, everything is questionable. Aiden\u2019s very sense of self is threatened to be overruled by the personalities of his hosts, most of which were nasty pieces of work: more than slightly sexist, selfish, mean, manipulative, abusive, more often than not physical and moral cowards\u2014yet still compelling even when you can\u2019t bring yourself to like them even a little bit, and I think that says a lot for the author\u2019s skill.The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle corkscrews into a tighter and tighter coil with every page and it isn't long before Aiden\u2019s constant picking at the stray threads of his new jarring reality makes the whole come apart, revealing far more than was ever dreamt of. I did not see that ending coming at all, and I was left astounded into an awed slow-clap at everything the author has accomplished here.When I flipped that last page, all I could do was breathe out,\u00a0with the kind of eloquence and poise perfectly befitting the situation: \"Holy shit.

Which leads to a lot of confusion and surprise.The third day, there's current-Bishop, past-Bishop and past-past-Bishop....well you get the point. Each day Bishop adds another \"character\" under his belt. He gets eight bodies, and eight days, to piece together the mystery. The two others who are in competition with Bishop are unknown to him and are also inhabiting bodies (though, unlike him, they cannot swap and every \"day\" their memories reset). They are all racing to find out the murderer, because whoever can figure out this mystery is the winner.And the winner? \nThe winner gets to escape.\n\nHow lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?\nThis book was confusing in the best way possible.I could barely write my summary - there's just so many layers of complexity and betrayals and everything.So effing impressed. I was wholly ensnared by the mystery - I hardly knew what to think or where to look - but it was such a fun and wild ride that I didn't care.Aiden Bishop was a wonderfully fleshed-out character and Turton did a particularly excellent job with the various bodies that Bishop possessed.In particular, I loved how each body Bishop possessed would begin to influence him. When he was Dr. Sebastian Bell, Bishop was meek, under the butler's influence Bishop became moralistic and so on. It was fascinating to watch how that played out.The only thing that threw me slightly was the end. The build to the climax and the ending were superb...but the actual grand reveal was a bit of a letdown.I honestly don't know what I as expecting, just something a bit \"more\" - if that makes any sense...All I know is that this is an author to watch. \nI cannot wait to see what Turton writes next!!\n\nWe are never more ourselves than when we think people aren\u2019t watching.\nAudiobook CommentsRather well-read, a thoroughly enjoyable book to listen to!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads", "(4.5) If you\u2019re looking for a book to keep you awake at night because you NEED to finish it then this is it!Somebody\u2019s going to be murdered at the ball tonight.

I kept needing to go back and reread parts because I really got lost as to what body Aidan was in at what time..... I was also a little bit overwhelmed keeping track of all the characters and what part they played in the story, but again it could have been me!I liked the premise, I really was intrigued by the mystery, I just was not invested enough to probably grasp the full concept.... additionally I had a huge expectation of a fabulous ending that would make all of this make complete sense to me, and that sadly did not happen for me.....So while I found this book very clever in concept, I found it a little... ok really a lot confusing for me....

But thanks ladies for making me realize I was not alone in this! \ud83d\ude18 ", "The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a thriller following an investigation into the murder of a girl who is murdered every singe night. The main character switches bodies every day in an attempt to get different points of view. And yes, it is wild.So the thing I\u2019ve seen praised about this book is that the plot is ridiculously complex, and it very much is. I am in awe over the tight plotting used in this book. This must have taken a very long outline and the complexity certainly makes this stand out. I think, however, that the marketing has been very focused on plot twists - I was only seriously shocked by a few twists reading this book, and I\u2019ve already forgotten what, exactly, it was. The delight in this book is not in plot twists, but in seeing the full story come together. I will say that the actual ending, though I predicted parts of it, had enough surprises that it was still delightful. As with many adult thrillers, I struggled to connect to or care about any of the characters. The lead character is almost completely lacking in personality, which makes sense given the entire theme of him being absorbed into bodies, but doesn\u2019t work, as we\u2019re led to believe that he is in constant danger of becoming something awful but never given details to notice or a reason to care. There\u2019s a way of writing a compelling character with amnesia; high motivation, people around them we care about, etc, and this book doesn\u2019t do a great job. I was mostly, however, really disappointed by the bodies Aiden switches into: almost every person he occupies is a completely terrible person. Bell is quite boring and later revealed to be terrible, Mr. Collins spends his entire day in agony, Ravencourt is terrible (and for unrelated reasons his section was my absolute least favorite of the book). That\u2019s just the first three, and I will not be going into the rest because they get much worse. Something I really enjoyed about this book, however, was the message - this book is very focused on realizing the changeability of people, and though I never cared about any of these characters much, I did find myself believing in and enjoying the message. I think this message is probably the most daring the book ever gets. ..So I actually considered and came very close to rating this book a four star, but I found myself forgetting it very quickly. With a thriller of this type, I usually would have kept my rating a four no matter how much I forgot. However, the fatphobia in this book was utterly ridiculous. I found it rather disturbing to read such an absolute distate from the narrator and author for the fatness of the character he inhabits: Ravencourt is described as a \u201cpig\u201d and a \u201ccow\u201d over and over, and repeatedly described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d with seemingly no regard for his humanity. The voyeuristic imagery of fatness is, exclusively and completely, meant to disgust and shock the audience. It is the main thread of a good 20% of the book. a few quotes are stated here, and this reviewer only got to the beginning of this section, at 20%, so can I just say: it\u2019s like, five times that many. I found this incredibly distasteful and disgusting even once, and the near-constant repetition of this rhetoric had me wanting to put the book down. I'm really wondering what the authorial intent is here, and perhaps more importantly, how the author must interact with overweight people in his own life.I also felt that rape was used as a plot device in a way that made me somewhat uncomfortable \u2013 SPOILER: (view spoiler)[a bunch of the book is told through the pov of a person who committed a rape approximately two hours before, and it\u2019s criticized, but\u2026 the impacts on the victim are very much ignored. (hide spoiler)] This is a huge and very common issue in literary fiction, but I also hated it and it impacted my enjoyment of this as a thriller.So\u2026 despite many good elements, I kind of just want to tell you to read The Westing Game instead. Nothing but respect for MY president. TW: really intense fatphobia that the author really sounds like he agrees with, suicide, and rape. \u2728Arc received from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest review. \nrelease date:\n 8 September 2018\ud83d\udc9cbro read with EmBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "Stuart Turton has written an extraordinarily original, atmospheric, intelligent and fiendishly complex novel that I really loved! At one level it masquerades as an Agatha Christie style golden age classic crime, and indeed many of the tropes present in that genre are here such as the diverse range of characters at a country house party. It is no exaggeration to say it is so much more, including the presence of time leaps, and absolutely nothing is as it seems. Prior to the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle, there was another death 19 years ago where justice was not fully served. Aiden Bishop is a guest at the party where Evelyn is murdered, he is trapped in a nightmarish Groundhog Day, destined to relive that day until he solves the crime and identifies the murderer. Each day he takes on the body of a different character at the party, with all the consequent complications that ensue, such as the differing friend circles and enemies.Turton gives us a heavily detailed, inventive and ambitious story with beautiful, and lyrical prose. Whilst I found it compulsive reading, it is not a book for everyone, I can see many finding it frustrating. The author is to be congratulated for penning a tale, which whilst occasionally exasperating, allows the reader to exercise their little grey cells! This is a book for those who enjoy being taken out of their comfort zone, enjoy intriguing puzzles and have a penchant for the curious and the strange. A brilliant and twisted read that is never less than enthralling. Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC.", "wow. this book is wild! i swear, i spent the majority of the story whispering \u2018what the heck is going on???\u2019 to myself over and over. i still dont even think i know what i just read, i just know i really enjoyed it. this is a \u2018whodunnit\u2019 unlike anything i have read before. mainly because of how ambitious it is. there are so many characters, each with their own role and secrets, which creates multiple plot layers and forces different outcomes for various events, all while a murder is trying to be solved! not to mention this story isnt told in chronological order. each \u2018host\u2019 wakes up at a different point during the same day, with one man reliving that day eight times. its enough to get anyone confused! but the overwhelming amount of content is what makes this story so exciting! there is just so much to grab onto to that the reader is never left empty-handed. additionally, i love the writing. the story feels like the words of someone who has written their entire life (can we take a moment to appreciate that this is a debut?!?). not because its distinctly flashy or clever. if anything, its a very subtle kind of writing style. but its also the writing style of someone who is confident in their ability, and that kind of tone works so well this particular story and genre. i will admit, because this story asks so much by requiring the reader to steadily keep up with everything that is going on (and trust me, theres a lot), you definitely have to be in the right mood/mindset to read this and willing to make the commitment to see this to the end. so if you are looking for a thrilling murder mystery that will constantly keep you on your toes, then this book is exactly what you need!\u21a0 4.5 stars", "I need urgent extra brain cell transplantation right now!

", "I just finished my September 2019 reread for my IRL book club, and I am still in love with this book! Also, I just came up with a completely different theory on what the \u201c7 1/2 deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\u201d REALLY means, and I\u2019m so curious to know if I\u2019m right. It\u2019s horribly spoilery, and it\u2019s behind spoiler tags at the end of this review. All the stars! Review first posted on Fantasy Literature. Debut author Stuart Turton\u2019s The 7\u00bd Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, originally published earlier this year in Great Britain as The 7 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, is an intricately plotted murder mystery, set in an isolated early 20th century English mansion, with a highly imaginative speculative element that is only gradually revealed, as our main character tries to figure out who he really is, and how to solve the mystery of Evelyn Hardcastle\u2019s pending death \u2026 or has her death already occurred?**I've avoided spoilers BUT I do discuss a part of the basic concept of the book in this review, some of the things that are disclosed around the 12-15% mark, not to mention in the book's blurb. There's definitely something to be said, though, for going into this book completely cold, like I did. If you're interested in doing that, stop reading this review, don't look at anyone else's, and just go read this book! It's worth your time!**The plot and setting are worthy of Agatha Christie: Lord and Lady Hardcastle have invited a number of guests to their British country mansion, Blackheath House, for a weekend party to celebrate the return of their daughter, Evelyn, from Paris. (The notable guests and household staff are conveniently listed in a copy of the party invitation at the beginning of the book.) One of the guests, Dr. Sebastian Bell, suddenly comes to himself while running through the forest surrounding Blackheath. The name \u201cAnna\u201d was on his lips, but he has no idea who Anna is or who he himself is. His memory is completely blank. Bell is horrified to see a man chasing a woman through the forest, and then a scream and a pistol shot.Eventually Bell, with a little mysterious help, makes his way back to the mansion, where he tries to convince the other guests to search for the woman he is certain was murdered in the forest. But nobody at Blackheath knows (or in any case admits to knowing) a woman named Anna, and they\u2019re dubious about Bell\u2019s improbably story, particularly in light of his amnesia. Bell meets several of the other guests, including Evelyn Hardcastle, a blonde woman in her late twenties who quickly strikes up a friendship with him (\u201cI loathe getting to know people, so whenever I meet somebody I like, I just assume a friendship immediately. It saves a great deal of time in the long run.\u201d) In the late evening Bell sees something that frightens him so much he faints. He wakes up in another person\u2019s body \u2015 the butler, Mr. Collins \u2015 in the morning of the same day that he just lived through as Sebastian Bell. His day as Collins is even more hellish than it was the first time around. And then he wakes up again, early in the morning of that same day, in another person\u2019s body. Is there a way out of this nightmare?I went into The 7\u00bd Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle without knowing anything about its plot; I had conveniently forgotten the blurb by the time I began reading the book. Normally I hate not having context in a novel, and being confused about what the book I\u2019m reading is generally about. But in this case going in blind was highly appropriate, because our main character (who does find out his real name eventually) initially has no idea who he actually is or what is going on around him. The light sheds very gradually, but it all comes together in the end with an awesome set of twists and turns that Dame Christie herself certainly would have admired. Characters often aren\u2019t who they seem, and events that seemed to signify one thing frequently turn out to have an entirely different meaning.The plot of The 7\u00bd Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is so layered, with a tremendously tight timeline and so many interwoven elements and characters, that I can\u2019t help but picture Turton writing this novel in a room filled with vast numbers of Post-it notes and crisscrossing strings tying everything together, like in the old Heroes TV show.(Turton has, in fact, stated that he used a massive spreadsheet, a notepad for each character, and a map of the setting \u2015 as well as the aforementioned Post-it notes \u2015 in the process of writing this book.) The speculative element is fascinating, if slightly far-fetched, but undeniably creative. When the main character realizes that the personalities of his host bodies are leaking through, affecting his thoughts and reactions, it deepens the plot.On top of this, Turton adds insightful writing that\u2019s a pleasure to read. I highlighted some sixty passages in the book; some of them were to help me keep track of the plot and characters, but others were simply for the beauty of Turton\u2019s writing.She\u2019s trying to anchor me with words \u2026 but I\u2019m impervious to reason, consumed by my hatred for the man I was. His flaws I could accept, perhaps even overcome, but this is a betrayal. He made his mistakes and fled, leaving me holding the tatters of his scorched life.Turton also adds symbolism to The 7\u00bd Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, including the decaying mansion, Blackheath, which echoes the failings and degeneracies of the upper class characters who are the guests at this dubious house party. A chess piece appears and reappears. A person in the costume of a plague doctor shares information with our main character about his situation and his mission.This compelling murder mystery, wrapped in a soft science fiction enigma, is a truly impressive debut novel. Its combination of classic British mystery, Groundhog Day and Quantum Leap blew my mind! I enthusiastically recommend it, and I seriously can\u2019t wait to see what Stuart Turton comes up with next.ETA: So here\u2019s my theory about the book\u2019s title. DO NOT open this spoiler unless you\u2019ve read the book. (view spoiler)[ Seriously, this ruins the plot! (view spoiler)[ The real Evelyn killed the following people: Thomas, Michael, Peter, and Helena Hardcastle (her whole family, though Michael\u2019s death was accidental), Millicent Derby, and the stable boy Keith Parker years ago. Plus indirectly Charlie Carver, who was hanged for Thomas\u2019 murder that she committed, and she attempted to murder Felicity Maddox and half-killed her. That\u2019s 7 1/2! Coincidence? I think not. P.S. It turns out this actually is one of the questions on Turton's GR author page, and I\u2019m beyond tickled to find out that my theory is right!! (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]", "Well, yikes.Here are the things I knew about this book before starting it:1) Its original title (and current UK title) was The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, which, in pure coincidence, is very very similar to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and was therefore changed in the US. (I think this is awesome.)2) It\u2019s a murder mystery with quite possibly the coolest conceit of any book ever. (I think this is awesome.)3) It\u2019s teeming with gratuitous fat shaming. (I think this is one of the less awesome things I've ever heard in my life.)Add to that list that the style is extremely overbearing and unyielding over the course of 480 pages (which feels like many more), and you have my list of major takeaways from this reading experience.Let\u2019s go in order.NUMBER 1: TITLE THINGWell, we basically already covered this.But it says a lot that I still think this is the most interesting thing about this book, and it has nothing to do with its contents.NUMBER 2: PLOT THINGThe idea for this book is SO COOL. Which is why it\u2019s extra lame that I found the first 300-ish pages to be very, very boring, and also found the Big Reveal to be - while not predictable - also boring, and generally speaking was very bored by this whole thing.Also, the fact that the conceit of this book is what it is (meaning, a guy wakes up in a different person\u2019s body every day with the task of solving the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle) means there must be Magic involved.Cool! Who doesn\u2019t love magic?Um, apparently this author, because this Magical World goes largely unexplained and then is halfheartedly told at one point but is clearly not the Main Issue.Which is extra, extra lame.NUMBER 3: FATPHOBIA THINGReading this author say that he did not intend to shame fat people in this book is the stupidest, dumbest, most useless excuse for blatant hatred I\u2019ve ever heard.It\u2019s actually worse if the fat shaming in this book is not intended, because the idea that someone could go around subliminally thinking things as hateful as this is absurd. The way the fat character in this is written - traitless but for the fact that he is very fat, and therefore lonely and abhorrent and disgusting - is so awful. It\u2019s to the point of being basically unreadable.This book got better towards the end, but I still wish I had DNFed it at this point.NUMBER 4: STYLE THINGI could tell within a couple dozen pages that this style - extremely overwrought, extremely overbearing, and extremely present for the whole book - was not going to work for me.It never did.Bottom line: The only cool thing about this book was the idea behind it, and everything about the execution was a major bummer.-------------pre-reviewwell, i didn't hate this as much as i expected.what a rave review.rtc / 2 stars-------------42 pages into this and already brutally sick of the style. YET ANOTHER PROMISING READING EXPERIENCE", "4.5 stars!Whew, what a ride! Stuart Turton\u2019s debut novel is the kind of debut we all yearn for: explosive, energetic, engaging and truly something fresh and new on the scene. The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a brilliant, high-concept murder mystery that had the cogs in my mind turning from the very start (imagine waking up in the forest with no memory of who you are and immediately seeing a young woman murdered!). This, in fact, was the first mystery narrative in a very long time that has made me feel like I was part of the story\u2014immersed in the environment\u2014and the first that pulled me in to such a degree that I felt compelled to actively try to unravel the whodunnit mystery right along with the characters. Whodunnit and why! Turton\u2019s atmospheric world is so moody and immersive you\u2019ll feel you should be smoking a pipe with a monocle as you devour it. It was so deliciously wrapped in a sort of British noir, complete with the \u201cparty at a country estate\u201d of so many classic murder mysteries. Described by its publisher as \u201cGosford Park meets Inception by way of Agatha Christie\u2019s Murder on the Orient Express,\u201d this book lived up to the hype and description in a big way! Aiden Bishop is destined to relive the same day over and over again, in eight different bodies, until he can solve the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle. If he does not succeed at the end of that time, the loop restarts and he loses all of his memories of the previous loop, forcing him to start over from scratch with even the basics \u2013 who am I? What am I doing here? He realizes that he is both the hunted and the hunter, an innocent and a deceiver, in this highbrow whodunnit. Until now, I\u2019d only witnessed my fellow guests in their handfuls, their spite spread thin across the house. To be ensnared among them all, as I am now, is something else entirely, and the further I descend into the uproar, the thicker their malice seems to become. Most of the men look to have spent the afternoon soaking in their cups and are staggering instead of dancing, snarling and starting, their conduct savage. Young women throw their heads back and laugh, their makeup running and hair coming loose as they\u2019re passed from body to body, goading a small group of wives who\u2019ve grouped together for safety, wary of these panting, wild-eyed creatures. Nothing like a mask to reveal somebody\u2019s true nature\u2026All of this is wrong. The celebration is too desperate. This is the last party before Gomorrah fell\u2026The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle was both intelligent and intellectual, well-paced and deserving of all 500 pages it took up. In a lot of ways, The Seven Deaths was unlike any novel I\u2019ve read before. Skillfully woven together, it was the ultimate literary puzzle. The plot was complex in a baroque but fascinating sort of way, and all the threads Turton spun came together in the end\u2014no stone left unturned, no end left loose. With so many plots converging at once, that was quite the high feat to pull off, but you\u2019ll find it done here superbly in this debut novel. Stuart Turton offers veritable craft in the intricacy of his plotting, a kind of craft that I rarely see anymore. The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a mind-bender complete with time leaps and multiple murders seen from multiple angles all on this same day that keeps repeating itself over and over again.The prose was lyrical\u2014honestly, leaning toward flowery\u2014but it is the intricacy of the plot and the atmosphere surrounding these characters that Turton allows to really shine here. Yes, there were moments when this novel graced the line between intricacy and confusion, but it all unraveled splendidly in the end. It was a puzzle of a read; there were moments when the pieces wouldn\u2019t fit and you\u2019d have to scrap it all and start over. For some, that may present as a frustrating experience, but this novel is a real treat to those who love mindbenders, murder mysteries, puzzles and logic games. If that\u2019s you, I highly recommend this novel! Also, if the \u201cGosford Park/Inception/Agatha Christie\" description got your heart racing, then this is the read for you! The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle grabbed me and held me from the very start, probably the most veritable page turner I\u2019ve encountered so far this year, and that\u2019s no easy feat. For such high praise and phenomenal plotting, I give Turton\u2019s debut novel a very strong 4.5 stars. *****I received an advance-read copy of the book from the publisher, Sourcebooks Landmark, via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.FOLLOW ME HERE:Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Get a Copy of My Book | Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me ", " \u2018\u2019I\u2019m a man in Purgatory, blind to the sins that chased me here.\u2019\u2019What would it be like if one day we found ourselves in an another body? What if this happened on a daily basis? Us changing the vessel but retaining most of the traits that make us who we are? What if by changing identities we could turn back the time and prevent an injustice, a horrible crime? This is the wonderful premise of this exquisite novel by Stuart Turton, one of the most unique books of the year.A man has the opportunity to stop the murder of a young woman, Evelyn Hardcastle. In full Groundhog Day mood, he is given eight days and eight identities in which he must find the one responsible for the crime, otherwise everything will become irreversible. So, during a gathering that commemorates a tragic incident in the Hardcastle estate, justice must prevail. However, the wrongs that must be made right reach beyond a single murder\u2026 \u2018\u2019Nothing like a mask to reveal somebody\u2019s true nature.\u2019\u2019The story is set in Britain, around the late 20s, early 30s from what I could gather and the thing that fascinated me most in this novel isn\u2019t the mystery itself or the unusual background- although they are both brilliant- but the focus on human nature and its various and interminable implications. I can\u2019t even imagine the Herculean task of creating eight different characters to become the vessels of one person, all with their own characteristics and mannerisms and resulting in such a successful and marvelously written story. I admit I was a little bit cautious prior to reading Turton\u2019s book. I thought it would be too confusing or wordy but I couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Obviously, I cannot write a single sentence about the plot but I swear a most solemn vow to you that you will find yourselves with your mouth open in shock for about 60% of the story. That\u2019s how perfect this book is. So many twists, so many different, complicated, tiny pieces of an exciting puzzle. I promise you you won\u2019t be bored or confused. And if you do get confused, it will be in the best way possible. \u2018\u2019Now you see them as I do,\u2019\u2019 says the Plague Doctor, in a low voice. \u2018\u2019Actors in a play, doing the same thing night after night\u2019\u2019.There is seldom such a rich array of characters who are all interesting, secretive, twisted, kind, intelligent, manipulative. Think of any adjective in any language and it will apply perfectly to this perfect cast. As Aidan discovers clues -only to be left in the darkness soon after- so do we. As he meets the guests, as he gets the chance to live inside some of the characters, he gives us the opportunity to collect more evidence. We know nothing before he does and we obtain a much clearer picture of every person involved in the story. How many times can we claim this happens in a mystery? Not even in some of Christie\u2019s finest creations, in my opinion. Personally speaking, the figure of the Plague Doctor was the king of the story. Such a creepy, intimidating, cryptic character that elevated the novel into a whole new level. He embodies the concept of the Mask perfectly since nothing is as it first appears. Everyone undergoes a major transformation and every expectation and belief is turned upside down right until the spectacular ending.I would love to tell you so much more- good, old, blabby me- but I can\u2019t. You absolutely, utterly (...again with the adverbs, I know\u2026) NEED to read The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. It is a reading experience unlike anything we\u2019ve seen and read before. I would like to end this text with a question taken from the Reading Group Guide, included in the book, which I feel captures the psychological weight and the very essence of the entire story. \u2018\u2019If you know someone you loved had a devastating secret, would you choose to find out what it was or love them for who they\u2019ve become?

I felt a little bit cheated as I was so hoping the ending would have been just as complex and clever as the rest of the novel but for me it just seemed a little too easy.This was a Traveling Sisters Read that I read along with Berit and Marialyce.

", "I really don't know how to write a review for this book. Not because I didn't like it, it was fantastic, but because the plot is so intricate and woven I don't want to give anything away. So let's just say it's the story of Aiden, who wakes with no memory at all, just the word 'Anna' on his lips. He finds he's in the middle of a forest, and then manages to stumble across a murder taking place. Aiden is then destined to relive the same day over and over again, until he can solve the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle.Stuart Turton has done a great job here in his debut novel. As I said the plot is very intricate, but it's never convoluted or confusing, though it may be if you read it over several sittings. My advice is to settle down and read it in a day or two, a big ask I know at over 500 pages, but it would definitely be worth it, just to keep things sharp in your mind. Having said that I found 'The Seven Deaths Of Evelyn Hardcastle' to be one of my best and most rewarding reads this year. Highly recommended.", "\nGet ready for the most unusual, overwhelmingly impressive journey through this puzzle land of\u00a0 \"Murder at the Masquerade Ball\".\u00a0\nYou won't need a ticket to get in, just get a copy of the book (the hard copy so you can enjoy the map of Blackheath, a cozy and quiet place to read (you won't want any distractions), time to ponder all the twists that are going to keep your brain busy!!I loved it, but needed to pace myself and take my time to enjoy all the twisty turns that the narrator, Aiden Bishop, threw at me during his attempts to stop a murder that has already taken place!So many times while reading this one, I would have to\u00a0just pause\u00a0and smile at the action that was taking place because I was just so amused!!It was so atmospheric and the different players were all very intriguing and kept popping up throughout the story.\u00a0 Some favorites were the footman, Anna, Evelyn, and the Plague Doctor!I enjoyed my time at Blackheath House and this totally unique reading experience.\u00a0 I would recommend if you enjoy complex layered mysteries with a large cast of witty characters.

This was one of the most challenging reviews I\u2019ve had to write to ensure I didn\u2019t give a speck of the fun away. This book. Wow. The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a book you have to give a chance, and if you do, the pay-off is immense if mysteries are your cuppa. I\u2019m offering a basic synopsis because it is best to go into this one with all doors of possibility wide open. Evelyn has been murdered before, countless times. Her parents are throwing a gala, where she will be murdered again. Luckily, Aiden is tasked with solving her murder. Evelyn\u2019s story is detail-laden. Knowing that, it is on my short list of best mysteries because of its originality and refreshing storytelling. As I mentioned above, ample patience is required. It is not a book you will be able to speed through, but if it clicks with you like it did with me, it will be a compulsive, addictive, and impossible to put down. I spent most of the read analyzing and using my noggin trying to piece everything together, and I LOVED THAT. The writing is comforting and warm in its heaviness, and overall, I found The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle to be brilliantly plotted. Thank you to Sourcebooks for the complimentary ARC. All opinions are my own. My reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com ", "3.5/5 starsThe less you know about this mystery thriller book, the better your experience will be.First of all, take that rating rounding up or down with a grain of salt, this is a 3.5 stars book for me. As for the review, I honestly have no idea how to review this book, not only mystery/thriller is not my usual read or books that I review, I genuinely think that anything I say can be considered a spoiler for a book like this. I\u2019ll keep this review brief, try to go into this one as blind as possible like I did, it will enrich your experience. I\u2019m going to mention parts that work and didn\u2019t work for me as spoiler-free as possible in the next two paragraphs but feel free to skip reading them if you\u2019re already interested in this book.Let\u2019s start with the parts that work first. This is a debut and it\u2019s a very smart book, consisting of a well-structured storyline with everything coming together in the last 20% of the book. The execution of the conclusion was superbly done and unpredictable. Just when you thought you had everything figured out, Turton keeps you surprised and engaged with revelations. It\u2019s a slow burn but very engaging, I finished this book two days due to how unputdownable it was. I also think the side characters were well developed, especially considering the storytelling method. Prose-wise, this doesn\u2019t feel like a debut at all, Turton\u2019s prose is beautiful, sometimes it felt like reading a literature book.\n\n\u201cHow lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?\u201d\n\nFor the parts that didn\u2019t work, I think the main character\u2019s background should\u2019ve come sooner in the story. It was too late for me to really care about his predicament, I have no idea if this is the usual case with mystery/thriller books though. I mostly enjoyed reading the way the story unfolds but It could've been a better experience if I cared more about the main character. Also, one of the decisions made by the main character near the end of the book need more exposition, it didn\u2019t make sense and didn't sit well with me no matter how I look at it. Lastly, the book went on for a bit too long; there was one part in the middle section, specifically Day 6 chapters, where I was super bored and fell asleep.That\u2019s all. Believe me, this is shorter than my usual reviews and it\u2019s for many good reasons. Bottom line is that if you\u2019re a fan of mystery/thriller book, you really should give this debut a try.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest", "I\u2019m at a loss for words as where to begin with my review. I don\u2019t know that I will be able to convey into words my love of Stuart Turton\u2019s book, \u201cThe 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.\u201d A work of genius and for anyone who loves mysteries or the true old-fashioned \u201cwho dunnit\u201d, this is your book. This is not a modern day mystery/thriller but an honest to goodness murder mystery with a multilayered plot. This work of art requires your complete focus and attention otherwise you might miss one of the many crucial details. I found myself going back and rereading pages to make sure I didn\u2019t miss a clue. At times, I felt totally lost but then another clue was revealed and I would be back on track.Turton\u2019s book is not linear in the way the mystery is first revealed and ultimately solved, it will have the feel of taking one step forward and two steps back before the bigger picture becomes clear. He gives us a complex, intelligent and original novel that gave me renewed faith that there are great mystery writers out there with stories that force us to use our brain cells to figure it out. As I was nearing the end of the book, I started to turn the pages a little slower as I wistfully realized this novel was coming to an end. It\u2019s the ultimate paradox, you want to get to the end to see the conclusion but it also means the end of this remarkable experience. As a fan of escape rooms, I love the challenge of trying to solve the mystery to get out of the room. Now imagine solving the mystery, unlocking the room only to find yourself in another room and faced with another mystery and repeating this pattern multiple times before you can escape. Solving the mystery of who killed Evelyn Hardcastle is only the beginning to unraveling the bigger mystery. The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a labyrinth, a three dimensional puzzle and a great ride all in one book. Run, don\u2019t walk, to get a copy of this book but then catch your breath, pour yourself a glass of wine and savor each page of one of the best mysteries you will read. I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley.", "5 deserving stars!!! The best book!! (04/04/19 Update: I cannot believe this will be adapted!)Read for January Buddy Read in Buddy Reads.\nHow lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?This lost, I decide. Precisely this lost.\nWhen Bell Sabastian finds himself walking in a forest, lost and stripped of his memories; the only word on his lips a name: Anna, he finds himself utterly terrified. The distant cries of a girl being chased by a murderer and then hearing a bullet go off, doesn\u2019t help. Scared and shameful to find the girl dead, he waits when the murderer suddenly behind him, gives him a compass and a direction to follow. Without looking back, Bell, with nothing better to do follows in the direction the killer advised him to take, only to find the Blackheath mansion-dark and gray and completely isolated or so it seemed. Read more to know\u2026To be honest, I wrote the above lines when I was still in the beginning of the book, and now it seems so far away. This book makes me wanna read more of the genre, something more confusing, unpredictable and fun! Yes, fun! I must confess that though this is a murder mystery, there were times, I smiled at the cleverness of the story at the most inappropriate times. I was hell bent on finding some clues and maybe I did (some things were easy to find if you look hard), but in the long run, this was a remarkable read. The best thing was that nothing was left unexplained. Every little piece, every clue, every missing part was explained in the end and, and, and\u2026. I fear I\u2019ll spoil it for you. There is so much more to it\u2026 I will highly recommend you give this book a chance to confuse you, surprise you and make you fall in love with it. I\u2019ll reread it soon and bug everyone at home to get to it too!I really hope he writes more books! His debut is my new absolute favourite and I\u2019m gonna go find myself a hardcopy. If you have read it already, let me know your thoughts and confusions along the way. Do add spoiler tags for our friends who haven\u2019t. Take a look at my confused states as I went through it:(My last chapter\u2019s thoughts have the thoughts about the end and the outcome.)My Thoughts as I Read:Chapters 1-4:(view spoiler)[ So, why didn\u2019t that murderer kill him too? Could it be that Bell too was an accomplice (seems like a reasonable thing), but then why did he have those knife marks? And who was this Anna? The murderer is still out there, I\u2019m kinda sure it\u2019s one of the guests/staff members. Also, about the death of Thomas, could it be related? I am gonna try and not over-analyze anything since that\u2019ll only confuse me further. Plus, he really is a cowardly but good at heart guy. And where is that voice coming from inside his head? Could it not be his? Could it be something he\u2019s undergoing? Like a procedure?  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 5 and 6:(view spoiler)[ What the hell? Who was the stranger? Could it be that all the old guests have been called again? The guests that were present when Thomas was murdered? Maybe to find Charlie Carver\u2019s accomplice? Could Bell be in the helping process? And how the tell did that note from Anna tell him about his burning gloves? Perhaps it wasn\u2019t Anna who died. He didn\u2019t really remember her face.Plus I like Evelyn already! (hide spoiler)]Chapter 7:(view spoiler)[So, what the hell is happening? A single chess piece? But isn\u2019t this book about the death of Evelyn? And I was right about the same guests being brought back. Could it be that Thomas\u2019s parents are finding the culprit or could it be that since they believe that they can\u2019t do so, they\u2019ll punish them all?Is it weird that I don\u2019t trust Daniel so much? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 8:(view spoiler)[Why am I smiling? This is so much fun! What if there\u2019s no Anna? Just a name? Anyway, it could be that whosoever called him there didn\u2019t come because of Evelyn\u2019s presence or perhaps calling Sebastian to there was a distraction to place that stupid bloodied rabbit in his room. And that compass, where did that come from? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 9:(view spoiler)[ Oh, okay. I already know this. I wasn\u2019t sure but this is the book where he wakes up in a different body each day, right? Will he be reliving the same day? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 10:(view spoiler)[This reminds me of a movie I watched. A movie where everything was repeated again and again until our hero finished a task. But he came back in the same body again and again and he could change how things happen by the way he reacted. Yes, it was Source Code.  (hide spoiler)]Overall, Chapters 1-10So I finished the first 10 chapters and this is so so good! For some reason, I find myself smiling. Probably because of the cleverness of the plot. I hope it remains good till the end.Chapters 11-14:(view spoiler)[Some questions: that nurse (or whoever she was) who was sitting next to the butler, who was she? Could she be Anna? I wish Evelyn had revealed something. She knew? That\u2019s unsettling. I must admit, it was clever to leave that note though I wonder what Cunningham would find. Also, whoever was in Daniel seems as irritated as our protagonist. And the footman, that\u2019s like a devil who is after them, making them cautious and faster. I am looking forward to meeting him! (hide spoiler)]Chapter 15:(view spoiler)[One thing I don\u2019t understand yet. Alright, everything goes the same way for 8 days. The host\u2019s will and brain is used by the protagonist and other\u2019s like him, but we all know there\u2019s a reason why the hosts are doing the things they are doing-to find about Evelyn. For example, the butler was frozen in place when he saw Sebastian Bell in the rain, but he was frozen because he had been Sebastian the previous day and was only confused and shocked. Why would the real butler freeze in his steps there? Why the real characters did what they did? Little rabbit, is he? Lol. And poor Cunningham but that was a clever way. Also, did the previous people who became Ravencourt try that? (hide spoiler)]Chapters 16-17:(view spoiler)[For some weird reason, I think the man chasing them in the morning was also our protagonist. Now, that would be grand, won\u2019t it? Aiden Bishop. If that Plague Doctor knows everything, why did he ask about the name from our protagonist in the beginning? Could it be that he also doesn\u2019t know some stuff? Mrs. Derby sure I clever. Did Evelyn break into the room? Also, where the hell is Cunningham? Could he be involved with someone else? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 18:(view spoiler)[I don\u2019 think it\u2019s Cunningham or any of the eight hosts. It can\u2019t be. (hide spoiler)]Chapter 19:(view spoiler)[All my amusement is gone too. Her parents are horrible! And they couldn\u2019t even bother to come and announce it themselves! Ughhh! (hide spoiler)]Chapter 20:(view spoiler)[So, I suspected it might look like a suicide. Yes, why the change of weapons? Could there be something in her drink? I wish one of the hosts is Michael. Will Cunningham still be his friend when he wakes up on another day?  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 21-22(view spoiler)[I don\u2019t like his new rascal host. Ew. Maybe he is the one who actually attacks Evelyn and Madeline and then hands over the compass to Bell, but what about the bullet? Could it be the girls? I like Anna, and I hope they all are freed, but I think one would be left behind. (hide spoiler)]Chapter 23:(view spoiler)[So, I was right! This is somewhat predictable but I am immensely enjoying it. This is fun! So, the Plague Doctor regrets the Aiden voluntarily joined to solve this murder mystery? Well, maybe then they both know each other personally. Or am wrong. I wanna know that since they are solving this mystery, is Evelyn dead in real already and now they are trying to find the murderer or she will be murdered in the future and they are actually trying to avoid it? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 24:(view spoiler)[Thank God, he is now going to find out about Cunningham. Otherwise that envelope under the chair would\u2019ve caused a huge hole in the plot. So Anna knew him before? Is that it? And why would everyone be afraid of him if he does it right? I wonder what\u2019s plan B. this just got even more interesting! (hide spoiler)]Chapter 25:(view spoiler)[What if there\u2019s something in that pond next to which Evelyn kills herself? No? yeah, I doubt it. Stanwin can\u2019t be the murderer. (hide spoiler)]Chapters 26 and 27:(view spoiler)[Lol, what will happen when Derby wakes up? Could it be one of the rivals who hit him on the head? Or was it Evelyn? Also, yeah, Anna could betray him. I think he remembered Anna\u2019s name because Aiden wanted to start from her. She might be the clue. And all this means that Evelyn Hardcastle died a long time ago. (hide spoiler)]Chapter 28:(view spoiler)[You\u2019ve been a blight on this world ever since I brought you into it.\u2019He brought him into the world? Oh, lol. I get it. Sorry (haha). But on another note, he has the weapon! Yay! P.S. Who broke into Helena\u2019s room and what did he find about Cunningham? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 29:(view spoiler)[You know, I\u2019ve not suspected Michael, but for some time, I feel like he\u2019s been mentioned so less. Could he be involved? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 30:(view spoiler)[So, if today they are finding the killer, why did Evelyn do all that every damn day? Anyway, it could be the Plague Doctor, but I don\u2019t know. Or the other rival or even Anna since she wanted him to be near that rock. Poor Evelyn. And did Millicent just die from just a heart attack? (hide spoiler)] You know what I love? That I am still only half-way through the book!Chapter 31:(view spoiler)[Why did Evelyn look confused when she pulled the trigger? Was she told it would be fake or was it just something natural in her state? Or perhaps she saw someone? Did she herself pull the trigger, or someone shot her before she could? He died, I loved that scene. And the death scene of Evelyn changed. Damn. (hide spoiler)]Chapters 32-34:(view spoiler)[So, what if Daniel is up to something? Why would he be so trusting? Anyway, I think that the favour he has to ask is ii be there when the footman is to be caught but I cannot be sure since they apparently dropped that chase. Also, it was weird why Gold asked him to stay in the carriage. Will he really give her up if he leaves it? I think he\u2019ll leave the carriage anyway. I really want to see Helena now; it\u2019s been long overdue. Anna has been missing in the last few chapters too and even though she is hiding something, I think she\u2019ll be an ally to Aiden in the end. And Sutcliffe was the same in whose wardrobe Cunningham found the mask?  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 35:(view spoiler)[Finally met one of the parents and he is such an ass. He sure is hollow and only cares about money. I never really trusted Cunningham and Helena and it\u2019s good to learn they are mother and child. Maybe he is working for her then? Plus who told Cunningham to tell Aiden and give him the message saying all of them? (hide spoiler)]Chapter 36:(view spoiler)[This was fun. Poor Bell. But very good! Anna won\u2019t show up but I hope it goes well. I think Anna will betray him for some reason. And I hope he doesn\u2019t leave her. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens when this all is done-the mystery unraveled. I wanna know who gets out.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 37:(view spoiler)[This was twisty. So, did Helena frame her lover? I don\u2019t know if she was involved in killing Thomas, but if she were, was Thomas not her child? Sometimes I wonder if Thomas really is alive. What is Cunningham up to? Just proving that Thomas wasn\u2019t murdered by Carver?  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 38-39:(view spoiler)[So, if Aiden has done this thousands of times, did the footman too? I mean if only one of them is to get out, why didn\u2019t the footman ever win? And why wipe their memories every time the loop is reset? And what clothes did Helena find? Were they Thomas\u2019s? And why was Stanwin surprised at his treatment of Lucy? Are they together or something? Do they have a connection?  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 40:(view spoiler)[So that was quick! I didn\u2019t expect Daniel to just kill Stanwin like that, and then come out in the open. I wonder how Aiden changes when he is in Daniel\u2019s body. He must be the most powerful host. That red haired girl is Lucy. Damn sure!  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 41-43:(view spoiler)[Caution will be my truest friend now.Yeah, it better be!\u2018I don\u2019t know how to get us both out of here, Anna.\u2019\u2018I know.\u2019\u2018But I will, I won\u2019t leave without you, I promise.\u2019\u2018I know that too.\u2019And that\u2019s when she slaps me.\u2018That\u2019s for murdering me,\u2019 she says, standing on her tiptoes to plant a kiss on the sting. \u2018Now, let\u2019s go and make sure the footman doesn\u2019t murder any more of you.\u2019This is so sweet! I laughed so much here. A little ease in this otherwise twisted and utterly serious tale. I want to believe Anna too. Maybe she was saving some other host of Aiden, someone who might be more helpful. Maybe she was just saving herself. (hide spoiler)]Chapter 44:(view spoiler)[So why did Gold want to be hit on the head by inviting Jim there? Daniel always was shady, but who is he then? Could he be the Plague Doctor?  (hide spoiler)]Chapter45:(view spoiler)[Charles? I forgot who was Charles. Cunningham?  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 46 and 47:(view spoiler)[This was a handful. Helena, why the hell are you? Poor Carver :/ And Thomas. And now Daniel!! And why did Thomas bolted? It suggests he was meeting someone at the lake. Probably Helena.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 48-50:(view spoiler)[I finally trust Cunningham! So, yeah, someone could be willing to kill the whole family. Could it be Carver now? Okay, what about Michael? Who the hell killed Peter? God, there is just too much information to hold up in my tired and exhausted brain! To be continued tomorrow. It\u2019s just there have been more deaths just than Evelyn\u2019s. Thomas, the stable boy, Millicent, and then there\u2019s Carver who was innocent, and Bell and Gold who have been attacked. And Evelyn\u2019s plan was good but it obviously failed. Someone did shoot her though.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 51:(view spoiler)[This was so good. I wish Jim didn\u2019t die. He was so much help. Michael was going to kill her. I had my doubts about him but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d do it of kindness. So, when does Evelyn die? And I did suspect Millicent\u2019s death being a murder.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 52:(view spoiler)[Our Aiden is quick to forget, isn\u2019t he? He got out of the carriage, he is now going with Daniel to somehow spill his own secrets\u2026So, I read it, and damn! But I still hope Gold won\u2019t be so crazy today. It\u2019s the last damn day. I wonder why the Plague Doctor cares about Aiden so much. Is Anna going to betray him again? Where the hell was she? I do pity Daniel.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 53:(view spoiler)[This was so intense. He came for revenge and he took it. He took it until he forgot his sister, his vengeance, his own self. And Oliver, I wonder how he is still sane. I couldn\u2019t see Anna for the leader of those groups. It\u2019s a huge thing he does for Anna, to meet her even when he knows she killed his sister. Looks like Blackheath has rehabilitated him too. Now, let\u2019s get on with Millicent. I also want Daniel out! Is it too much to ask?? I wonder what he did to get in here! Wouldn\u2019t it be grand if he were Anna\u2019s accomplice in real life? This story seemed to have stemmed out from Science-Fiction and I\u2019m not wrong.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 54:(view spoiler)[What is he going to paint? This is so so so soooo good!  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 55:(view spoiler)[Oh wow. She does seem to have changed. I wonder why she had Dance and the butler killed, and even Derby by having him stand next to the rock. Was it because she was forced?  (hide spoiler)]Chapters 56 and 57:(view spoiler)[Another amazing chapter! Thank God, he\u2019s dead. But he was a remarkable character. Will the butler wake up again? You know, I kept waiting for Anna to shoot the butler too, lol. Guess she is trustworthy, eh?  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 58:(view spoiler)[Did the stable boy\u2019s father do it? But he was too scared when Dance asked him. He couldn\u2019t be it.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 59:(view spoiler)[Shit! Damn! Wow! Felicity to the rescue. Will the Plague doctor free Anna because she risked her life for Aiden? Or will he still ask for an answer? And Michael lied\u2026 he was going to kill Felicity for his psycho sister. He was an act all that time.  (hide spoiler)]Chapter 60:(view spoiler)[This felt good. I hated Evelyn. She just left the poor boy there and killed her brother. Two brothers remained but Cunningham didn't matter to her, she did loved Michael a lot who was ready to kill for her. Look like she did look ill in his years or perhaps his love for her blinded him. Oliver might be punished but he was a good man, someone with a conscience. Anna and Aiden, both, became better people, though Daniel sure didn\u2019t. He did have a clever host though. I thought they\u2019d simply wake up and find themselves, but maybe they\u2019ll sleep first? Doesn\u2019t matter (does matter), I loved it! Every moment of it. Maybe it was wise to let go of the past, maybe Anna should too. But it\u2019s hard in its own way.

Not because I didn't love it, but what to say so that I don\u2019t give anything away.This review is going to be short and to the point. The less you know about this book, the more you will enjoy it!The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle was a mixture of a Agatha Christie novel and the sci-fi television series, Quantum Leap.So, if you\u2019ve never heard of Quantum Leap, the premise of the television series is the main character Dr. Sam Beckett (Bakula) is placed in the body of someone else and he has to correct historical mistakes during that episode. I loved it!And The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle has this type of vibe. The main character, Aiden Bishop is placed in a different character each day until something terrible happens to that character. Once that character has died or is no longer in service, he can\u2019t use it again. But while he\u2019s in each character, he must try and figure out who killed Evelyn Hardcastle so that he can escape Blackheath House.There are so many characters in this book that I had to keep looking back at the invite in the front of the book. It has all the characters that are cordially invited to Blackheath House for a masquerade.Trust me, use that to your advantage when this gets a bit complicated.The fact that this was a debut book of Stuart Turton blows my mind. The creativity and writing is just excellent. I wish that the book had been a bit shorter, but he does an excellent job of creating this setting and mystery.And when the murderer is finally revealed, I had no idea!! I'm usually great at solving mysteries since I read this genre all the time but Turton got me this time. Well done sir!!!I really have not read anything like this yet and I loved it!Recommended to mystery lovers and anyone that loves a well-crafted plot of suspense and originality.", "This is not 'Gosford Park' meets 'Groundhog Day'. This is 'Friday' meets 'Revolution 9' by way of Miley Cyrus (is she still relevant?). I'm sorry, but this bundle of cheap thrills had no redeeming feature.The very first paragraph hit me unpleasantly. It was as if a movie had started with the hero walking away from a gigantic explosion that he barely notices. This is like a supercomputer that can beat anyone at chess yet cannot play tic tac toe.It's not literature in any way shape or form. I hope the author never writes another book, as he has struck gold on his first attempt. But however precious gold is, you cannot eat it if you're strung in the wilderness. I felt revolted reading through the pages of this fucking garbage.", "I really can't express how much I hated this book. It felt like I was taken in, because it promises a lot up front, but it does not deliver. Too many characters, too much going back and forth between the same scenes with no clear road map made my head hurt. 512 pages of confusing gibberish later I thought there might be a stunning conclusion to wrap it all up neatly, no, that was way too much to hope for. Many of my smart Goodreads friends did not finish this, I wish I could have been among them.", "See Full review on my blogObviously, I am like the other reviewers:This book is amazing. The plot is so complicated and full of action, you literally could not stop reading until you learn WHAT THE HELL IS ACTUALLY GOING ON!If I didn't have that unforgettably pleasant night, I'd go with 3 stars, If the end didn't disappoint me I'd go with 5 stars,So I settled at 4. I so liked this book but I wish the ending, was a bit different.  This is me on page 501...I felt like lots of things left unanswered. But still I am glad I have read this, GREAT book.

It's very important to\u00a0see autistic women at the forefront of efforts at representation, expanding the conversation and the vision for autistic characters.That said, I fault this book for many things\u2014each one jabbing at my initial excitement, until it deflated completely. I fault it for being boring, averagely written and riddled with clich\u00e9s. Most important, though, I fault it for demonstrating knowledge of important issues only to lampshade the significance of its premise rather than delve deeper into something more nuanced. I expected more from this\u2014more rigor, more thoughtfulness, more craft. Instead, I was left staggered and uncertain how to feel about the whole thing\u2014about an ending that felt trivial, almost mocking the seriousness of the rest of the book, and a fizz of uneasiness that I couldn\u2019t quite shake afterwards.This is the story of a woman who was smart and beautiful and accomplished, and who simply had the poor fortune of coming across men who had never cared for more than their own entertainment, who didn\u2019t have her welfare anywhere remotely near at heart and who treated her more like a boring convenience than an exciting toy. So, she stood there and accepted the weight of the blame, because clearly, if someone hurt you, there\u2019s something wrong with you to deserve it. For Stella, it was her autism.If it were obvious and unmistakable at any point in the book that the author was highlighting this attitude as a problem, I might feel more kindly disposed toward it.\u00a0Instead, it\u2019s relying on the misguided belief that autism is an inherent flaw that you\u2019re supposed to overcome, and it\u2019s positioning the love interest, Michael, as someone who will, and I quote, \u201cseduce [perhaps more aptly termed in this context: fuck] the anxiety out of [Stella]\u201d, failing to examine the crucial fact that Stella\u2019s past sexual encounters didn\u2019t go awry because of her autism\u2014her past dates were simply pieces of shit who didn\u2019t treat her like a human being. And then, Michael comes along, shows Stella the barest scrapings of human decency, and she feeds off that, because she\u2019s been starving and thought such crumbs a feast.It\u2019s like the novel version of those heterosexual dating articles whose entire premise is basically: \u201cHow To Hack Men Into Treating You Like a Person.\u201dThis is a frustration exacerbated by the fact that once Stella establishes that she enjoys physical contact with a man (read: a man who treats her decently and who doesn\u2019t leave her laying on the bed like an unloved doll splayed out on the floor), she suggests that they now forgo the sex altogether and work together to figure out how to make her comfortable in romantic situations, and so begins a fake-relationship which of course blossoms into a romance.I fault this book for trying to depict a well-balanced pairing only to deploy it in ways that feel manipulative and disingenuous. The bar was already set so low for Michael\u2026and yet, he still managed to slide right under it.\u00a0Michael says all the right things to make Stella feel comfortable, but his words stand in blatant contrast against his actions\u2014which were infuriatingly manipulative and alarming. For instance, when Stella clearly voices her discomfort with something, Michael sweeps aside her comments like you\u2019d brush crumbs from a table and assures her that she\u2019ll enjoy it when she tries it, and of course, she does\u2014her agency completely disregarded by this point. The relentless patronizing Michael was subtly practicing throughout this book left a deeper impression than anything else, and this sort of behavior from a narrator whose perspective I truly wanted to trust, but who frequently engages in musings on hypocrisy and inconsistency, stuck out in ways that I couldn't just chalk up to unreliability.Also egregious is how Stella\u2019s symptoms seem to conveniently disappear around Michael. In fact, it was pretty obvious early on that the narrative was charitably embellishing Michael\u2019s traits, palliating his possessiveness, and only illuminating his character by villainizing literally every single other male character. This is made even more manifest in the second love interest, Philip, Stella\u2019s coworker, who is painstakingly one-dimensional: he\u2019s an unmitigated jerk. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the extent of his contribution. I can\u2019t overstate how exhausted I am of this trope. If the romance in your book is only inevitable because every character who\u2019s not the potential love interest is an unbearable asshole\u2026maybe you have a problem.Speaking of problems, there was a particular scene in the beginning that stirred the most unpleasant riots of emotions in me: Philip comes into Stella\u2019s office, casually asks her if she\u2019s a virgin and gives an unsolicited advice from \u201ca man who\u2019s been around the block a few times\u201d (I rolled my eyes so far back I could see the last of my brain cells dying) which is that if she went out and fucked a lot more men, she\u2019d be more experienced and have more luck. The entire scene was howling \u201csexual harassment in a workplace\u201d and, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the fact that this whole encounter was carelessly glossed over was extremely disappointing.I'm still very frustrated by this book's refusal to explore so many prominent ideas in favor of escalating a plot that keeps a very tight, narrow focus on a romance with really questionable dynamics. I do recognize, however, the importance of books like The Kiss Quotient and how they help improve awareness and diagnosis rates for this under-represented group and I hope to see a greater plurality of representation for autism.\u2728 wishlist \u2728 blog \u2728 twitter \u2728 tumblr \u2728", "4 1/2 stars. Well, this book. I'm not even sure where to start. I guess I'll begin with an overview.The Kiss Quotient is a seriously sexy, fun book that has rekindled my interest in the romance genre. When it hits the spot, I LOVE a good romance, but I rarely find one that goes beyond cliches and instalove so I usually end up bored. Not with this one. Not one bit.It's the perfect blend of sweet and steamy. And let me be clear: this is not YA. There's a lot of graphic sex scenes, though I should also say that the author builds up to it really well; she knows how to tease us. It was just so nice to read a book where sex is actually sexy and not political, cold, a form of manipulation, or not sex at all because consent went out the window.This is an ownvoices book about Stella, who has Asperger's syndrome. Convinced she needs lessons on how to be good at sex and relationships, she hires Michael, an escort, to teach her. Michael is mixed race - Vietnamese and Swedish - and described as a hotter version of k-drama star Daniel Henney. In a gender-reversed Pretty Woman scenario, the two inevitably end up developing feelings for one another.Stella's autism makes it difficult for her to know how to behave around other people, and she also struggles with being touched. Through this, the author explores the importance of consent - Michael is deeply respectful of her boundaries and always waits for her to be 100% ready. Perhaps it sounds less sexy than the spontaneous grab-and-go on the office desk sex but it actually isn't. It's kinda wonderful.Okay, and here's the weird thing. I don't know how to talk about this or if I really should, but I think it is worth mentioning. We talk about the importance of diverse books all the time and the way voices by POC, LGBT+, and those with disabilities are absolutely essential. They foster understanding and help a lot of people realize they are not alone. Well, I got a lesson in just how important books like this can be.As I was reading about Stella, I started to make some comparisons. I was so affected by it that I made a list. This list:\u2022 Extreme social anxiety\u2022 Loss of focus; frequent \"zoning out\"\u2022 Fanatic obsession with a small number of interests\u2022 Difficulty reading verbal cues and understanding sarcasm\u2022 No interest in playing with others as a young child\u2022 Avoiding eye contact or overcompensating and staring\u2022 Clumsiness and poor spacial awareness\u2022 Called \"quiet\" \"shy\" \"weird\" and \"odd\"\u2022 Outbursts of anger when losing or unable to complete a task\u2022 Deep levels of frustration and anxiety when routine disturbed\u2022 Practicing \"conversation trees\" in head\u2022 Facial tics Um, yeah. So this is me. Some of these are behaviours I exhibited as a child, but many I still do. It turns out I probably have high functioning autism, formerly known as Asperger's Syndrome. I currently only have a self-diagnosis and a score of 35 out of 40 on the Cambridge autism test (over 32 is high probability of autism) but I am pursuing a professional diagnosis.Huh.Honestly, this book just made me feel so... understood. Everything that I've worked so hard to hide and bury about myself is normalized and even celebrated. So yeah, it is sexy as hell and really sweet, but it's also so important. Seeing as so many women and girls go undiagnosed, this book could offer validation to so many who need it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "I am\u2026 not impressed.How lovely that this is an #ownvoices novel. Stella is autistic, as is the author, and so, no one can say that it is not authentic.But the storyline is not, however, very realistic.See, Stella is bad at sex, or so she says. She\u2019s also bad at relationships and human interactions in general. So she hires Michael, an escort, to teach her a thing or two.Or three. *suggestive eyebrows*I was entertained for the first fifty or so pages, then I became tired of the sex talk. Do we really need to talk about it in every single page? No, we don\u2019t. I was expecting a smart romance, but it really isn\u2019t that original. Of course, the fact that the main character is autistic is a breath of fresh air, but I didn\u2019t connect with her. I *understood* her \u2013 she\u2019s pretty straightforward and eloquent \u2013 but none of the characters felt particularly three dimensional to me.It\u2019s a lot of will they/won\u2019t they, but the reader knows that they will. Come on. So the fact that the protagonists are so confused about their feelings for one another gets old fast and becomes rather annoying. Enough! It also isn\u2019t\u2026 romantic. Or extremely sexy. It\u2019s steamy at times \u2013 what with all the sex/foreplay I sure hope so \u2013 but it didn\u2019t summon stars in my eyes (or, something else\u2026) and I will soon forget about this couple. It didn\u2019t help that the writing was quite dry. I know. This is an important book. But I won\u2019t rate a book highly if it didn\u2019t win my heart, especially considering that there are other *important* novels out there that actually managed to claim a place on my list of favourites.

I am not sure I\u2019ve ever been so happy, and had such a lame grin on my face, while reading any other book. This was heartwarming, beautiful, and a treat to read. Don\u2019t sleep on this one. Also, Michael and Stella are both partner goals, I swear. This is an ownvoices novel about a high-functioning autistic woman who has succeeded in every aspect of her life, except for love. Her mother is putting pressure on her to find someone and start thinking about family, now that she turned thirty. Plus, Stella is kind of lonely anyway, and as much as she loves throwing herself into her work, she wants to spend her life with someone who she can completely be herself with. The problem is, Stella thinks her autism makes her unable to successfully date, and maybe even unable to be good at/enjoy sex. So, she hires the dreamiest escort to help her! \n\n\u201cGirls like me intimidate boyfriends away. Girls like me have never been asked out by a single boy. Girls like me have to find their own way, make their own luck. I\u2019ve had to fight for every success in my life, and I\u2019m going to fight for this. I\u2019m going to get good at sex, and then I\u2019ll finally be able to entice the right person into being mine.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, Michael is an escort that doesn\u2019t do more than one session per client. Yet, after his and Stella\u2019s first night, he might be willing to make an exception. Michael is biracial (Vietnamese and Swedish), fashion designer, and has always put his family first, especially after the way his father left them all. Michael\u2019s mother is also battling cancer, and the medical bills are piling up. Trigger and content warnings for unwanted touching and forced kissing, lowkey sexual harassment, anxiety attacks, abandonment, a loved one with a chronic illness, a fatphobic comment/insult, and someone telling someone else about a person\u2019s diagnosis. Also, this book has very explicit and graphic sex scenes. But, like, all of the sex scenes in this book are 11/10. So damn hot, I swear. I have a lot more experience with sex than Stella, but I would happily let Michael teach me a thing or two. *clutches pearls forever* But please use caution if that is something you do not enjoy in your books!But besides the steamy sex, the beautiful romance, and the lovely messages that are inside this book, my favorite part is that this book never shames Michael for being an escort, and it sure in the hell doesn\u2019t shame Stella for being on the autism spectrum. A lot of other conflicts happen throughout, but those two things are never put in a negative light and it was such a blessing. And I never expect a fiction book to teach me anything, but this book gave me such a wonderful glimpse and perspective into some people\u2019s autism. (Obviously, I know that no two people are the same!) From overstimulation with lights, sounds, and smells, to the preferred clothing, to focusing everything into one thing, to the importance of schedules, lists, and reminders! This book was really insightful, and I loved that about it. The importance of consent is always at the forefront of this novel. I think that\u2019s why most people who are reading this right now are so in love with Michael, and it\u2019s because he always is thoughtful and so very patient with Stella. He truly puts her needs first, and makes sure he is never overstepping any line that she is not willing to cross. And I just loved Stella Lane as a character. She is actually probably my favorite heroine of 2018. Not only does she know who she is, she refuses to change for anyone, even the guy she has fallen in love with. I had happy tears in my eyes so much while reading this, and it was mostly just because I was so proud of her. Michael might be most people\u2019s wet dream, but Stella felt like the character I\u2019ve been searching literature for forever.  \n\n\u201cBut I want you to know I can handle the truth. If I\u2019m not enough for you, that\u2019s fair and I accept it. I\u2019ll get over you eventually. I don\u2019t want to be coddled or lied to because of what I am. I don\u2019t need your pity friendship\u201d\n\nOverall, this was such a perfect read! I loved this from first to last page, and I couldn\u2019t put it down. Here, I\u2019ll really sell you on how good this book is: Muse of Nightmares, my most anticipated release of 2018, came in the mail while I was reading this book. And you know what I did? I finished The Kiss Quotient before starting it. Seriously, this is a masterpiece. And I can\u2019t wait to see what Helen Hoang does next.

With this story, Helen Hoang gives voice to a syndrome that until now has been absent in the romance genre. Through her cast of endearing characters, she explores the importance of self-acceptance and the desire we all have to find that one person who makes establishing an intimate relationship feel effortless. I just wish I had enjoyed the plot as much as the characters she created. Viewing the world through an autistic lens brings a fresh energy to the storyline initially, but it doesn't take long for the formulaic feel of the plot to overshadow the quirkiness of the cast.A gender-swapped Pretty Woman of sorts, The Kiss Quotient introduces the reader to Stella Lane, an incredibly smart and driven, thirty-something, living with high-functioning Asperger\u2019s. Her social awkwardness, lack of interpersonal skills and myriad of other eccentricities have been a hinderance on her relationship status. Her best bet, she figures, is to start by improving her skills in the bedroom. So, how does one go about getting better at sex? I guess, if you\u2019re rich and lacking in social skills, you hire a male escort to teach you a few things. Who better to learn from than a professional, right? Lucky for Stella, Michael is the perfect specimen of a man. Tailor by day, sexual escort every Friday night and all around good guy\u2014what could go wrong? In the real world, probably a lot; but this is fiction. Predictable fiction. What's a romance novel without a happy ending?\u2014it's pretty much a given this is going to happen. Aside from the character traits I admired in both Stella and Michael, their love story felt dare I say . . . basic. Their budding relationship narrowly avoids insta-love, is paved with convenience and the will-they/won't-they is fueled solely by miscommunication on both their parts, which takes on a stale note rather quickly. And while we would all love to fall for someone who completely understand us\u2014no questions asked\u2014it\u2019s unrealistic to think it would ever happen this easily.Despite all of my issues with the plot, I still found this to be a worthwhile read. My big takeaway\u2014Helen Hoang\u2019s message in the Author's Note following Stella and Michael's story\u2014be unapologetically you. \n\u201cAs I pursued and eventually attained a diagnosis (at age thirty-four), Stella, my autistic heroine, was born on the page. It has never been so easy for me to write a character. I knew her intimately. She came from my heart. I didn\u2019t have to filter my thoughts to make her socially acceptable, something I\u2019d been unconsciously doing for ages. And this freedom allowed me to find my voice. Before this, I\u2019d been using every other author\u2019s writing style, trying to be someone else. When I wrote The Kiss Quotient, I became myself, and I\u2019ve been unapologetically myself ever since. Sometimes instead of confining you, a label can set you free.\u201d\n*Thanks to Berkley for providing my copy.", "The Kiss Quotient is quite the unexpected romance novel. Stella Lane is on the spectrum and wants to get better at sex so she can, hopefully, find a life partner and start the family her parents so very much want her to have. To get better at sex she hires Michael, an escort with a lot of debt and a few secrets but who, somehow, is exactly the man she needs. Of course he is! That's how romance novels work. But this is such a fun read and it's also quite original and sexy and sensitive. Stella is a really compelling protagonist and Hoang does a fine job of showing us who this woman is and how she negotiates a world that isn't as welcoming to her as she deserves. Lots to admire her! Well worth a read. ", "things about this that were very good:- the autism rep- the fact that while the author was researching said autism rep, she got diagnosed with autism- this is #ownvoices for autism and asian rep! yay! cool inclusion of vietnamese culture!- the female character is the moneymaker/works in STEM and the male character has less money/is a creative! employment gender role reversal.things about this that were not very good, for me, personally, sorry:- a woman getting f*cked out of some of her autism symptoms- a man not taking no for an answer (one time a man does this and it's Bad. but when the hot love interest does it, it is Very Very Good, apparently.)- i did not like the smut and i am sorry but i did not- the word \"quirky\" turns me off a character faster than you can say not like other girls- the protector-man gender roles were so bad- also so much \"chicks love that romantic stuff\" and \"men never talk about feelings\" type gender roles- REALLY WEIRD PARENT CHARACTERS WITH INCONSISTENT CHARACTERIZATION- felt pretty insta-lovey to me. like one second both are like \"we cannot be in love!!!! never will we allow ourselves!!!\" and the next. boom. lovefest city, population these two nerds.anyway. this book didn't work for me but clearly i'm in the teeniest minority in world history so.bottom line: read this if it sounds good to you i guess? basically the bottom line of all my reviews is \"please do not feel compelled to listen to my opinion and/or take it seriously.\"-------------CURRENTLY-READING UPDATESthis is...a lot.", "5+ Stars!!!  There isn't much better as a reader than finding a debut novel that you have zero expectations for, and it blowing you away. The Kiss Quotient did just that. Helen Hoang wrote a book that is smart, sexy, made me laugh, and gave me just the right amount of feels. There wasn't one thing I would change about this story or the characters. I loved everything about it!\u00a0Stella Lane is a thirty year old econometrician who is smart and successful, but lacking in one area of her life. Relationships. After her mother pressuring her to settle down and meet someone, Stella decides it's time she gives it a try. Stella has Aspergers, a high-functioning form of Autism that makes her a little awkward when it comes to relationships, sex, and certain social situations. Due to this, she decides to hire an escort to 'teach' her how to navigate this.\u00a0This is where Michael enters. Michael is an escort, but he's so much more than that. He is a stand-up guy who only escorts on Friday nights as a way to help his family financially. Honestly, he feels that he has no choice. When he meets Stella, he is stunned someone like her would hire an escort. She fascinates him. Michael is kind to Stella, he's patient and understanding to her situation. So much so, that being with him one night won't do.\u00a0\nThese were supposed to be simple sex lessons. Why was it getting so complicated?\nMichael and Stella develop a friendship and relationship of sorts. One of my favorite things about this book was seeing how Michael grew to care for Stella, embraced her quirks and handled everything that made her different. Both of these characters made my heart so happy. I adored them both and wanted nothing more than their relationship/friendship to go to the next level.\u00a0One thing I found so refreshing about this book is Stella's character. I could tell Hoang knew what she was talking about when she wrote Stella. Even though Stella is much different than me, she was very relateable.\u00a0 Michael and Stella brought out the best in one another and their connection and chemistry were off the charts.\u00a0The Kiss Quotient is quite honestly one of the best books I've read this year. It was perfection. The story is refreshing and unique, and the writing is intelligent and fresh. I can't wait to see what else Helen Hoang has in store. I'll definitely be reading every and anything else she puts out!\u00a0", "\nlord jesus mama needs a cold shower\n", "Re-read 6/12/18: Hi hello I am still SO obsessed with this book.

But since I don't have the physical copy of it yet, I'm going to have to be satisfied with hugging my kindle. The story was even better the second time round. I remember the miscommunication bugging me when it happened the first time I read it. Now, I'm realising us humans do have a major issue with communicating because we're uncomfortable with being vulnerable. I appreciated even more how unapologetic Stella became. How comfortable she became in her skin. It was so powerful to read. This story was just so pure and wholesome. My heart is full. ---------------------------I confess that I am obsessed with this book. These characters. I had problems breathing properly on several occasions. Why did no one prepare me for the amount of damn, steamy scenes were going to be in this book?!I could\u2019ve died just by swooning, good lord.Stella is my hero. Michael is my husband. (Book-boyfriend is too short term!) I need this man in my life. I\u2019m liking that more and more romance novels are coming out now that have substance and depth to them. In the past, they were pure enjoyment for me and they still are, but I was learning so much about high-functioning autism whilst reading this book.It just reinforces how much I love fiction. Storytelling is the most perfect of ways to understand the plight of others, because there are emotions that get triggered when we read which allows us to form a bond to the story and its characters. This then leads us to remember specific aspects of the story that have touched us the most, creating empathy. Storytelling deals with subject matters that make us fundamentally human. And they say fiction isn\u2019t educational.

It\u2019s the worst feeling and it can make it so hard to finally pick up that superlatively popular read, because nobody wants to be the only person who hates a book, right?\n\n \u201cAll the things that make you different make you perfect.\u201d\n\nNah, I\u2019m just playing with you guys\u2014this book was everything I ever hoped it would be and more.

She saw and interacted with the world in a different way, but that was her.\n\nSeriously, The Kiss Quotient is worth every single ounce of hype it has received and so much more. The chemistry is on fire, the story is so fun and captivating, and these characters\u2014you can\u2019t help but love them. Stella is incredible. I loved being inside her head, and knowing that it\u2019s own-voice autism rep, I wasn\u2019t surprised by how much of what she said mirrored things my own autistic loved ones have shared with me (as well as feelings I myself have had, having strongly suspected that I am autistic for a very long time but never having sought out a diagnosis).\n\nMichael was mint chocolate chip for her. She could try other flavors, but he\u2019d always be her favorite.\n\nWhile Stella is the star, Michael is honestly just as lovable and precious as she is. He\u2019s this biracial Vietnamese/Swedish man, though the only family we meet of his is the Vietnamese side, and they are all so lovable and wonderful, even down to his obnoxious sisters. I loved every scene in his mother\u2019s home, I loved his dedication to his mother and family in general, and I just cherished all of Michael\u2019s motives and inner dialogue so much.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want just a night or a week or a month with you. I want you all the time.\u201d\n\nBetween the cuteness, the math, the fake dating trope done flawlessly, the steamy sweet moments, and the fantastic focus on consent\u2026 I honestly have nothing but good things to say about The Kiss Quotient. Instead of rambling on, I\u2019ll just echo the tons of other people saying if you haven\u2019t read this book, you need to! It\u2019s wonderful, charming, sad, heavy, and sweet, all wrapped up into one emotional little bundle of romance, sex, and family.\u2014\u2014\u2014Buddy read with Owl!", "I started reading this Friday night on a plane, and as usual, I suspected I probably wouldn't make it past chapter 3 before just putting on my headphones and opening up my laptop to write instead. Most of my readers know I don't read much romance anymore, not because it's not good, but because I write it all day, I kind of need a break when I'm reading for pleasure. So I veer toward other genres. It's like a hairstylist, you know? You think their families would constantly be able to get their hair done, but oh, no. They're the last people to get their hair done! A stylist comes home, that's the last thing they want to do! lolSo anyway, I started reading. And I kept reading. By chapter 2 I was laughing. By chapter 3 I was like \"oh, yeah.\" By chapter 5 I was denying my complimentary pretzels and Sprite. And by chapter 12 my tired eyes were glancing between my Kindle screen and the hotel room clock, knowing I had to be up for a signing in 7 hours, and should I go to sleep or...ok, just after this part and then I'll definitely go to bed. The author gives us an incredible hero in this story. He has a tough hurdle to overcome, but he's noble and strong but also incredibly hot. He has just the right amount of edge and a touch of bad boy, but at the same time he's doing what he has to do and he's the only man who understands Stella. This guy from a completely different world than her is the only man who can talk to her and connect with her. When they strip everything away and are alone, close and quiet, they are everything the other one will ever need. Stella is strong and smart, educated and awkward in social situations, and I absolutely loved her. I connected with her. What built between these pages was a relationship between a striving woman and the man she hired to help her, both of whom never expected or tried to make it happen. It wasn't supposed to happen. The lines of the professional relationship start to blur, and slowly, their bond seals, even as they try to resist it. I loved this story. I loved both of the characters. I adored the side characters and how everything felt natural, the writing flowed, and the heat and need and longing for someone you're not supposed to fall for got stronger and stronger. And I really wish Hoang had more books out right now!Give this one a try when it releases, everyone! You won't be sorry!! And I can't wait to read your thoughts. And have others to swoon with <3 Because I feel so alone right now. Lol", "Alright, I am just going to up my rating to 5 stars. I devoured every sweet, smutty page of this story. Again. While I am not blind to this romance\u2019s flaws, I simply love it. I feel like this story was written exclusively for me. Original review The last time I enjoyed a romance novel this much was... hm, I think the word I am reaching for is NEVER. I am always looking for good love stories but rarely find them. This book scratched my romance itch just right. I pretty much loved it.So the setup goes like this. An autistic econometritian unable to form relationships and under pressure from her mom to start a family hires a male escort to teach how to \u201cbe good at sex\u201d so she knows how to attract and keep a man. She doesn\u2019t really like to be touched, so this challenge is no joke. If you\u2019ve read romances or at least watched Pretty Woman, you can see what happens next. The escort Stella hires is hot and fun, and most importantly, kind.You know how you read something soul-crushing like Cat Person  or that notorious recap of a date with Aziz Ansari  and get nauseous and depressed? Well \u201cThe Kissing Quotient\u201d is the opposite of that. It is a celebration of human connection, consent, pleasure and, as clinical as it sounds, enthusiastically reading the other person\u2019s nonverbal cues.As it always happens with romance novels, I did lose a little interest once the hottest part was over and the inevitable dramatic breakup started unfolding before the final sprint to HEA (I am not really keen on wedding, engagements, babies, etc.) To the author\u2019s credit, the novel mostly stayed away from tedious misunderstandings I loathe.But all in all this was a fantastic experience. A romance equally hot and sweet.You can request it on Netgalley.", "YESSSSSS! 2018 GR Choice Awards - Best Romance - Winner :)https://www.goodreads.com/choiceaward...----------------Even Sarah J.

A real charmer!Stella, an Econometrician, has intimacy issues, perhaps a symptom of her Asperger\u2019s. With her mother growing impatient for grandchildren, and after absorbing an ugly comment, which took aim at Stella\u2019s lack of sexual experience, she decides to hire a male escort to \u2018teach\u2019 her everything she needs to know about dating and sex. Michael Phan has never had a client like Stella. She touches a part of him, he keeps barricaded, especially with clients. Her effect on him is so powerful, he agrees to give her lessons on sex and dating, against his better judgment, and breaking every single personal rule of his profession.However, their business arrangement soon develops into something neither of them could have anticipated. Before long, Stella begins to figure in a new type of equation- love!Okay, I\u2019ve seen the huge marketing push for the book, and I\u2019ve had many friends on social media and book sites fawning it. From experience I know when a book gets this level of hype it is very important to approach it with a modicum of caution. Even though I was chomping at the bit to start this one, pushing everything else to the wayside if need be, I cooled my engines and let some of the furor die down before I finally allowed myself to read it. So, did it live up to all that publicity?I adored this story. It\u2019s unique, featuring a female character who struggles to find her niche in a world that embraces conformity and uniformity. I don\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s syndrome, but I am an extreme introvert, so I could relate to some of the struggles Stella fought to overcome. I immediately warmed to her character and hoped she would find the confidence she had buried inside of her all along.While I didn\u2019t know how to feel about Michael\u2019s unorthodox occupation, I did LOVE this guy\u2019s gentle patience. It was fun watching Stella crawl under his skin, seeing how he understood her, quirks and all, and how they managed to create a relationship with each other, as Michael slowly draws Stella out. Michael turned out to be a terrific hero, and I might have developed a secret and deliciously sinful crush on him. That said, the book was still a wee bit over-hyped. While I understand why some felt this one was special and deserved a lot of attention, the format, at its core, is not much different from any other contemporary romance. The writing or prose didn't set it apart from any other books out there, although it is obvious the author knew her subject matter intimately. What does set it apart is the diversity, and the boldness of placing a character with Asperger\u2019s as a lead in a romantic comedy. The delicate balance of approaching the syndrome with respect and the gravity it deserves, while adding in humor and poignancy, is very well done. From that perspective the story is very original, unique, and refreshing! Everything you love about romance is here: It's hot and steamy, funny, charming, emotional, and inspiring, with a lovely feel good ending. However, this one gives voice to those rarely featured in these types of stories. I love that about this book!! I for one, applaud this new angle and approach to contemporary romance, and hope to see more books step away from the standard 'Plain Jane' tropes and branch out into new, mostly unexplored territory, in the romance genre. Books like this one could help the genre shake off a few of its hardwired stigmas and reach a much broader audience.  4.5 stars", "Aww how cute is this?! I wanted to read this because of the #ownvoices autistic storyline, but hesitated for ages because...adult romance is not my thing lmao. But I was too curious not to try, so here I am and my opinion is seriously: AWW HOW CUTE IS THIS.It almost reminded me of Lara Jean x Peter Kavinsky...with the fake dating. But grown up. And with a lot of sex. And he's an escort and she's an autistic and works in economics instead. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af So um nothing alike but the FAKE DATING. It's a freaking good trope.It was really addictive to read. I powered through it in a few hours and it was sweet and soft and kind. Like woah give us a man like Michael who: sews, has lots of sisters that he takes care of, he loves and supports his mum like nothing else, he designs clothes, he respects women, he cooks, he's a martial arts dude. afdksal his Michael though. He's also biracial Vietnamese and there's so much family love and culture woven into the story!And their romance was such a slow burn emotional build up. I don't even LIKE solely-romance books but I was just flipping pages, teeth gritted, whispering, \"They better frikkin work out or else I love them too much.\"And the autism rep nearly made me cry with how perfect it was. I think it's the little things that made it so real, so accurate, and so so up-lifting. And also at the end when Stella says a big loud NO to changing herself and just says: I am autistic and this is who I am and I'm not broken. And I'm just scREAM cheering in the background. As an autistic myself, late diagnosed too, I just totally fell in love with Stella. She's not a stereotype! She's kind and loving and sweet, and also super sensitive and fixated on routines and obsessions. If you want to read a book to really see what it's like being an autistic woman = CHOOSE THIS ONE.This book has given me all mushy feels. Aww. It was two people genuinely falling in love while convinced the other didn't love them that was so good to read. And good autism rep!? And sweet characters who I both loved incredibly.

While I enjoyed it, I didn\u2019t love it. I think the hype ruined it for me, as I had mighty high expectations going into this. \n25-year-old econometrician Stella has autism; she\u2019s high functioning but has trouble with social skills and intimacy, amongst other issues. Her mother wants grandbabies and pressures her to date. But Stella does not enjoy dating, nor does she like sex. When someone suggests to Stella that she practice honing her sexual skills, she takes their advice and hires male escort Michael, to teach her what she does not know. Michael happens to have a conscious and quickly realizes that Stella is different than the other woman that hire him. Genuinely wanting to help Stella, he goes against his rule of spending only one night with a client and allows Stella to book him for multiple sessions. The two fall in love, but must fight through their insecurities to stay together.\n\u201cShe had a disorder, but it didn\u2019t define her. She was Stella. She was a unique person.\u201d\nStella\u2019s character is what makes The Kiss Quotient stand out from other romances. It\u2019s clear Hoang did her research and seamlessly incorporates Stella\u2019s insecurities stemming from her autism. Autistic women don\u2019t usually show up in romances, and Hoang takes a risk with Stella\u2019s character. I also really liked Michael\u2019s character; Hoang truly creates Stella\u2019s perfect match with Michael.This is fast-paced, addictive, easy read. The premise is a little out there, but it makes sense especially after reading Hoang\u2019s Author\u2019s note. I just wish it hadn\u2019t been so predictable. I saw how everything could play out very early on the book but I was hoping that Stella and Michael\u2019s romance would take a different path; one that is as unique as their characters.  Outside of Stella having autism, I feel like I have read books like this before. I was hoping for something a little more outside of the box, but it was overly predictable. Overall, I found this to be a fun, fluffy, and unfortunately, formulaic read.", "Update.. This is going to be a feature film!!!!If you haven\u2019t read this charming book yet...consider it!!!!!

", "10 perfect stars!Review & Excerpt at Of Pens and Pages.\n\nAll the things that make you different make you perfect.\u201d\nI am in love. The Kiss Quotient is a beautiful and realistic debut novel that breaks stereotypes, embraces uniqueness, and makes one think about their self-worth. It\u2019s the kind of book that will make you smile, swoon, tear up, and think. I was on cloud nine when I finished it. It\u2019s been a few days since I finished reading this book, and I\u2019m still on a high! I haven\u2019t read anything since. It took me so long to articulate my thoughts, and I still don\u2019t think I gave this book justice, but let me try.Stella Lane may be a well-paid and successful econometrician, but for her mother, nothing would be better than for Stella to finally give her parents some grand-babies. Babies mean intimacy and sex, two things Stella isn\u2019t particularly well-versed. If she\u2019s going to take her mother\u2019s request seriously, she\u2019s going to need to learn the ins and outs of sex. No pun intended.Who better to teach her than Michael? The beautiful man who can give Daniel Henney a run for his money definitely knows sex; he gets paid to seduce women and pleasure them. So she hires him to teach her. What Stella doesn\u2019t consider is that maybe she\u2019s looking at it the wrong way. Maybe it isn\u2019t just sex she needs to learn, but relationships itself.Michael only sticks to doing his night job on Fridays, and never with the same client more than once. Stella\u2019s request breaks so much of his personal rules, but he can\u2019t help but say yes. The effect he felt the short time he spent with Stella was unlike anything he\u2019s ever felt before. But those feelings need to get out of the way because he can\u2019t have her. Stella is smart, rich, and beautiful, and she deserves so much more. Not a man with a past he continues to escape.As they go on with Love and Relationship 101, Stella and Michael learn so much more than what\u2019s in their lesson plan. They learn about each other, and they both like it very much. Now, they just have to decide whether to pursue the real deal or not.This book is heartwarming, sweet, and angstier and steamier than I expected. And I\u2019m not mad about it at all. This book made me tear up more than once because of Stella and Michael and how perfect they are for each other. To see two people so in sync and see how much they\u2019re helping each other is heartwarming. It isn\u2019t one-sided. Michael needs Stella as much as she needs him. I love Stella and Michael so much. Words aren\u2019t enough to express my feelings about them. Stella is strong, endearing, and so precious. She\u2019s a genuinely nice person, thoughtful and nurturing to others. As a person on the autism spectrum, she has issues with social interactions that can sometimes give the wrong impression to others; worse case scenario, it hurts or offends them. It\u2019s not something she does on purpose, and she tries her best to be aware of her words and actions to keep it from happening again. My heart went out for her that she had to hide her condition, afraid that people might see and treat her differently.Sweet Michael. He\u2019s everything I want and more. This man is hard-working, loyal to the core, sweet, and oh my Lord is he hot. This man will make your heart and panties fall, you guys. Such a cinnamon roll. And the tongue on this one. I am fanning myself right now!And I just have to say I love his family. It was such a delight to see the Vietnamese side of his family, their interaction with each other so genuine and fantastic. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know Khai in The Bride Test!With an engaging writing, amazing chemistry, and relatable characters you\u2019ll fall in love with, The Kiss Quotient is a book you need to read. A perfect summer read. A perfect read for any time of the year, really. It\u2019s definitely one of the highlights of my year! The Kiss Quotient is something I will never forget and will forever cherish in my heart. You need to read this book. I promise you won\u2019t regret meeting Stella and Michael. Tropes: Escort, Fake RelationshipPOV:Third Person, Dual POVStandalone: Yes*ARC received in exchange for an honest review. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram", "The Kiss Quotient was heartwarming, charming and quite steamy! Stella Lane was completely endearing. She is smart, driven and living with high-functioning Aspergers. She also has relationship and intimacy issues. How does one overcome those? With a master teacher of course. Enter Michael Phan. He is suave, sexually experienced and a male escort. Sound familiar? It definitely had a flipped Pretty Woman vibe and you know what - it totally worked!Amidst their \"lessons\", Stella and Michael discover there is much more to each other than meets the eye. They were just so cute together. Michael so patient, understanding and caring of Stella's need. In turn, Stella truly seeing him for who he is - encouraging him and accepting him. Is that a bit idealistic? Yes, it is but this is a romance novel. Isn't that part of its appeal. I easily got lost in their romance and found myself rooting for them to have their happily ever after. \ud83e\udd70Helen Hoang has firmly rooted herself as a must read author for me. We are 2 for 2 with her novels and I am beyond excited as I anticipate book #3 with one of my FAVORITE & swoon-worthy side characters! Write quickly Ms. Hoang - your readers are anxiously awaiting more steamy, romantic goodness!!!!", "well i promised myself i wasn't going to 5 star this, but then the author's note at the end made me cry like a lil bitchthis book was so excellent. like the blurb says, it's about a woman with autism who hires a male escort to help her with her own perceived social ineptitude. but honestly it's just a perfectly romantic story about two people who just really get and accept everything about each other.what did i like: almost everything but here's an actual list- stella had a typically masculine job & michael had a traditionally female one!!! we love gendered job reversals!!!! (ALSO SWEDISH VIETNAMESE MALE LEAD)- stella was a REAL person and not just a diagnosis (who wasn't woe is me about it either!)- everything was on STELLA's terms... never pushed to have sex she was uncomfortable with- that being said there was a lot of hot sex\u2122 that imo was not overdone- so many moments where i was GENUINELY clutching my chest at the romancewhat i did not like- michael's hang ups.... ur a grown adult man. get a grip a little bit??- douchey pervs that didn't have to meet their maker- wish there were more snippets of daily life to make the relationship a liiiiittle more fleshed out- that's literally it, i'm not satan in a sundress today folks, this book rocked in general, i think you will love this if you feel like you haven't met your \"person\" yet or if you have and are really really happy about it. i love understanding, i love communication. thanks book, for having both.********************buddy read with a fellow romance loving pal, haley!", "\n1.)

Starting with lgbt \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 characters and continuing with several psychological disorders - one of it being Asperger. I\u2019m no professional at this issue, I only know the definition and some people who have it, but in my opinion this was a great representation of it. The whole story is about Michael and Stella. Stella is a successful business woman who works in econometrics. Her life seems good: she earns a great amount of money, has a great pair of parents and is beautiful and extremely smart. But there is one thing that never really works for her: Men. So one day she decides to take an escort to teach her how to have great sex. And with this decision she meets Michael, an escort for every type of woman. But only on Friday. Until he meets Stella and falls deeply in love with her.Whoa, this book is the perfect balance of sex, love and drama. Whoah, guys. If your prude or don\u2019t want to read something smutty, then don\u2019t read this book! Because \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25This book Is hot and sweet and everything you wish for.

And with his cute smile, which makes all the hearts explode, he\u2019s even cuter.I like that the author makes him a in some way arrogant but still likable character. He\u2019s kindhearted, charming and gives so much love to everyone around him. That makes him so precious \ud83d\udc95Next to him Stella is even more lovable. She\u2019s so smart and a little bit weird and that makes her so adorable and awesome. She\u2019s successful, smart, honest and still she\u2019s a sensitive and friendly person with a big but rightful heart. I fell in love with her on the front page and it didn\u2019t change throughout the book.

I don\u2019t want to spoiler you, (but it\u2019s obvious - it\u2019s a contemporary) but I love these two together. I mean their relationship was adorable, wonderful and so beautiful. And so pure. I mean, most of their problems were caused by huge misunderstandings and misinterpreted feelings and words. But again, there wouldn\u2019t be no drama without these things. So, all in all, I loved the love in this story\u2665\ufe0f Writing style \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fWell, that was beautiful. It was simple with a nice flow and pacing. The chapters are not that long, so you literally flow through the book. I finished it in just a few days and I\u2019m so happy with it. It\u2019s not my favorite, The hating game is unchallenged, but it was still wonderful and some time later I\u2019ll definitely reread it.", "I devoured this in a single sitting. And it was fucking delicious.For me, this book has everything going for it. It's dramatic, emotional, educational, complex, diverse, and hotter than sin. This is an own voices romance with a female lead on the autism spectrum, and the entire plot setup revolves around her commitment to becoming better at sex. Because, for Stella, being touched by another human is a tricky, sometimes highly unenjoyable experience. So what's a modern, successful, driven woman to do? Hire a male escort to give her sex lessons, obviously. Enter Michael. He's half Vietnamese, and half Swedish, and described as looking like Daniel Henney, only hotter. YES, PLEASE.He also comes with a lot of (understandable) baggage. His dad is an epic douche, and because of how he treated Michael and the rest of his family, Michael is left feeling like he's never going to be good enough. For himself, for his mother, and also for Stella. From their very first interaction, it's obvious that these two have some serious chemistry, and the pages practically smoldered beneath my fingertips as I was reading. This is definitely one of those romances that could be listed as an erotic one, so for those of you who like your love stories without the physical act of love in them, be aware of that. But this is also so much more than smexy times. Stella has never had a boyfriend before, and as their relationship changes, she has to learn how to navigate through all the social interactions that come with that: meeting Michael's friends, his family, going out to strange places with him. For someone on the autism spectrum, that can be a living nightmare. The social anxiety, the sound sensitivity, the potential for stimulus overload, it made for some tense and suuuuper awkward situations. I felt so much for Stella because of her unabashed way of relating all of the above. And for Michael as well, because, like I mentioned before, he comes with his own set of issues and is brutally honest about them to himself. This whole story just felt so real, if that makes sense. Most romance drama always feels borderline OTT to me, like, just TALK TO EACH OTHER AND RESOLVE THIS SHIT. The kind of petty misunderstandings and stubborn lack of communication that makes me want to rip my hair out. This book, while definitely heavy on the internal conflict toward the end, never felt like that. Because Stella and Michael's voices are both so separate and unique and relatable that I got why they were having trouble communicating. This is a romance, after all, so in the end it all works out. And, for me, it\u2019s one of those refreshing, modern, feminist, cathartic books that I can see myself re-reading every time I start to lose my faith in this genre. So, yeah. That should tell you everything you need to know about how much I loved this.This review can also be found on The Alliterates.", "5+++++ STARS\n\nI don\u2019t want just a night or a week or a month with you. I want you all the time. I like you better than calculus, and math is the only thing that unites the universe.\u201d \n\nThere's only one way to summarize my feelings for this book, and that's to tell you that it's an ABSOLUTE FREAKING MUST READ. The Kiss Quotient was quite possibly the most charming, addictingly satisfying romance I\u2019ve read all year! It was everything. ALL OF THE THINGS. And I\u2019m on cloud 9 after finishing it! I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019ll do with myself now because nothing could ever compare to the ultimate perfection that was this unique and wonderful story full feels and steam. Nothing I could say could possibly do it justice, but I'll try.The heroine: Stella LaneHow I loved her. Here's a female that's the very antithesis of your typical romance heroine and she was PHENOMENAL. When I first read the blurb and saw that Stella has Asperger, I was so curious to see how the author would depict her. And I can tell you that I couldn't be more satisfied. There's just something so incredibly endearing and ultimately just...real, about Stella. She's full of quirks, but she's also vibrant in her own way. She has a fulfilling and successful career, but relationships and sex are such a foreign subject to her, that she continually suffers through terrible dates and unsatisfying sexual encounters. With her family's constant pressure for her to finally settle down, she knows that she needs help. And so she gets that, when she hires an escort to guide her through the art of dating and relationships.The hero: Michael PhanGah! JUST GAH! This man. I can't even begin to describe all of the ways I adored him. Forced to work as an escort in order to help his family, Michael doesn't exactly brag about being an escort. As a matter of fact, it's more of his shameful secret. Used to women seeing him for just his looks, he's almost jaded on relationships....until he meets beautiful and sexually clueless Stella. There's just something about her that makes him question everything he thought he knew. Their connection is instant and so potent, I felt the energy of it sizzle on the pages. Here's a man that's not a playboy (escort aside), he's not an a-hole either. There was also something so real about Michael to me. I adored his relationship with his quirky and colorful family. But I absolutely loved the way he was with Stella. He's the perfect gentleman with a filthy mouth. God but I loved him. I loved him so freaking hard.This book was simply amazing. It was unique and fresh and full of heart. It was unlike any other romance I've read and I couldn't get enough of it. Helen Hoang has got an instant mega fan in this reader. I will blindly read ANYTHING she writes, no blurb required. She's a talent that EVERYONE needs to discover and this book one that EVERYONE needs to fall in love with. Because that's exactly what will happen when you meet Michael and Stella; you'll fall head over heels for them same as I did. This romance will stay with you, it will engrain itself into your memory and make your heart feel full with it's emotion. In a nutshell; read it, read it, JUST READ IT!!ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:  ", "**4.5-steamy stars rounded up**This book filled my heart and just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did!

Michael was so kind and had such patience with her, I dare you not to find him attractive.The scenes were steamy but still tender in an oddly compelling way. There is a lot of dirty talk though, so if that is not your thing, you maybe want to avoid this but otherwise, give it a shot!Obviously, towards the end, I did get frustrated a bit with the lack of communication between the characters, but I understand you need some drama.

I was in such a nostalgic mood.\n", "Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry\u2019s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he\u2019s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there\u2019s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy\u2019s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you anything about what we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve been doing A LOT. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see you soon, we just can\u2019t tell you when\u201d? As if he hasn\u2019t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Harry. Doesn\u2019t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what\u2019s best for him better than he does? And that\u2019s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children\u2019s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child\u2019s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren\u2019t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn\u2019t infallible. James Potter isn\u2019t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn\u2019t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that\u2019s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George\u2019s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry\u2019s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn\u2019t sunshine and roses and you don\u2019t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don\u2019t get the sense that Sirius\u2019s death was a righteous one. You don\u2019t get resolution. He didn\u2019t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don\u2019t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest", "I cried like a little baby. J.K. Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book. She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book. Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager. I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears. Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K. Rowling. ", "re-read August 2018it had seriously been too long since I read this book! I love angsty Harry and all of the crazy drama that this book contains. Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To Youok. I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT. It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading.That being said, here are some of my thoughts on the book:-mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book. I've noticed particularly during this re-read that J.K. Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story. She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books.-it's so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix! Sirius is such an amazing human, and he was born into a terrible family, which is pretty true of a lot of people. Just because you come from something/somewhere terrible, that doesn't mean you can't be different and be good.-Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great. Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect, yet Dumbledore chose Ron. Why? Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers, and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something. Dumbledore is cool like that. -Quite often I forget that St. Mungo's exists since it's not in the movies at all. Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES.-it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch. and Harry was so sad because of it, which made him cranky and quite insane. HOWEVER, I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker. I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already, and it's particularly in this book that I grew to really like her. She's so much better in the books than in the movies.-In the epic fight near the end of the book, NEVILLE IS SO BADASS. If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong. He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody. It was awesome.-As usual, lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book. This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of. I love how many answers we get in this one.I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. I have a lot of feelings, so I might add more later.", "Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others. Here\u2019s three things I really loved about it: 1. Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry\u2019s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2. Dumbledore\u2019s Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they\u2019ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna\u2019s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she\u2019s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did. ", "I am always ready to pop off on anyone who says they don\u2019t like this book because \u201cHarry is so angsty and annoying in it.\u201d Well, why don\u2019t you watch a peer die right next to you, witness Adolf Hitler\u2019s resurrection, have a trusted adult admit they\u2019ve been lying and manipulating you, and then get sent home for three months to live with people who loathe you, all while being ghosted by the people you actually like for weeks AND SEE HOW WELL YOU DEAL WITH IT.On top of all of that, you\u2019ve got a government publishing daily articles detailing why you\u2019re a crazy person with an overactive imagination and to pay no attention to that 100% alive noseless man behind the curtains.  DON\u2019T EVEN WITH ME ON THIS.Also, I still remember reading this book on my bunk bed in 8th grade the day it came out. Never in my life had I experienced so much fiery rage toward a fictional character. Fifteen years later and Delores Umbridge still wins the award for character whOSE LAUGH COULD ACTUALLY PROVOKE ME, A PACIFIST WHO LOVES CAPS LOCK, TO RAGE PUNCH AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. Hem hem.  ", "Finished this one last week and forgot to mark, but I loved it. I ended up taking a massive break for several months because I'm such a mood reader but I really have always loved this one. I remember missing the magic as a teen since Umbridge was being Umbridge but the last act remains one of the most exciting in the series. And I was really happy to get to revisit the scene where Harry talks to Nearly Headless Nick about why some wizards become ghosts and why most don't. I always wanted that scene in the movie, but it's beautifully done in the book. Also loved the extensive conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, which was also reasonably shortened in the film. #AdamRereadsHP", "\nI DID IT! 5 DOWN 2 TO GO!

Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four\u00bbThe \"big number 5\", the longest novel of Harry Potter series, begins... \"HolyMadonna, how big is this book?\" my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling's game have definitely changed. . The axiom \"before we'll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen\" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you're not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now.\u00abThere is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there\u00bbLet's talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what's on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future.

And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry.\n\u2b50\ufe0fInterlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst Phase\nHarry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. \nReturn To Actual Review\nJ.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? \u201cI forgo\u2013\u201d \u201cLUCKY YOU\u201d This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.", "\nUmbridge? More like Umbitch.That woman deserves to die. Painfully.\n", "\nThis book used to be my least favorite book of the series and after rereading it, I can't understand why... I loved it!So many good things I had forgotten started here like the DA meetings. I still absolutely hate Umbridge and I'm out of my reading slump (hopefully!).\n", "AHHHH I AM FINALLY FINISHD. *collapses in a puddle* Peoples, I usually read a book in a day, two days if it's big, three if it's super huge. THIS BOOK TOOK ME FOREVER. I know there a lot of super-keen Potter fans out there, so, um, you may not want to read this review. But! But! WAIT! The biggest thing you need to know is: I seriously love this series. I do. It's so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it's captured the world in it's wizarding claws. BUT. I didn't grow up reading it. And now? Reading it? I love a lot of things, but there are so many things that bother me, particularly about The Order of the Phoenix. THINGS THAT BOTHERED ME:+ The freaking gargantuan size. This is the most important thing to note. IT IS HUGE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS BIG. The first 100-pages are numbingly boring...they cleaned house? SO WHAT. + Ron/Hermione's bickering drove me nuts. This trio of \"friends\" act so often NOT like friends, it just really grates on me. I know friends have their ups and downs, but Ron is downright rude. Harry is usually oblivious, but he doesn't help things much either. Of COURSE I'm Team Hermione here, and I know she gets together with Ron...but I ain't shipping it.+ The last 50-pages were so intense and interesting...WHY WERE THEY SO SHORT?? It's like the book FINALLY warmed up and got going and got exciting and -- BOOM! -- it's done now. Plus so many interest reveals just come as a Dumbledore info-dump. Um. Seriously?+ The characters, in general, drove me nuts. I love Dumbledore, don't get me wrong, but he's awfully passive. There's this whole attitude around like \"Awww, well nothing TOO BAD is going badly, so let's just wait until it gets absolutely horrific before we do anything, shall we?\" AND ARGHHH YOU STUIPD STUPID WIZARDS.+ And Harry's logic...I mean, lack thereof...was frustrating. Like \"Omg, a teacher is physically abusing me...I won't tell! I'm a strong brave little melon!\" NO YOU'RE A FREAKING IDIOT. Harry's whole mantra of just suffering in silence made me so so angry.+ Snape. Because it's a grand idea to have a teacher who abuses and bullies students because he had a crappy childhood. Solid work hiring him, Dumbledore. I HATE SNAPE, BTW.+ In general, the book's huge GARGANTUAN themes of \"injustice\". This one is very very much me, but social injustice and discrimination against children and adults exercising their age as a way to control/lord over younger humans -- I HATE IT WITH THE FIRE AND PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS. Sure, yes, it has it's place in books. It's realistic. But every time I pick up a Potter book, I just get smothered with how unjust everything is and it makes me SO ANGRY. And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books, THAT is what makes me wait, like 9 million years between picking up volumes. There should be more balance. There should be more fighting back instead of passiveness.+ And please, someone remind me why Harry still needs to live with the Dursley's? Because I think we've established he doesn't. Another = injustice for no reason.OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE.I also have a list of things I freaking loved. And at the end of the day, I do like this series. I don't \"adore\" it like a true Potterhead, I 'spose. But I do enjoy it.THINGS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE:+ The detail. okay, I do complain that the books are too big (they are) but I have to admit this makes the worlds SO INCREDIBLE DEEP. Like all the food details, the off-handed comments, the descriptions, the subjects. IT'S INSANELY AWESOME. It's not like reading about a bunch of kids going to school...it's like genuinely being there.+ The fact that they actually had to DO SCHOOLWORK. So often I read books about characters who are not \"geniuses\" but still manage to save the world AND score uber well in school without doing a scrap of homework. NO. So I love that Harry Potter makes them save the world AND do their homework. And half the time I think their homework sounds freakishy fascinating. Yes, I'm having a Hermione moment.+ HERMIONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER. She is like one of the biggest reasons I love this series and would even consider rereading (seriously!! I just said that!! Even though I complain!! I'd like to try audios one day...) because she's smart and into equality and rights and I just love her, yes okay?!+...oh and McGongall. I love her too. SO SO MUCH. She does not take a single piece of crap from anyone. SHE IS AMAZING. I love how she fought Umbridge, although I think she could've done more (like stabbed Umbridge in the eye or something) and I love how she's fiercely protective of her students. She's like a super scary mum.+ The Weasleys. ALL OF THEM! Even Ginny is getting more a personality now! YAAAY. I particularly love Fred and George and I'm glad they're living their dream. (Oh, but obviously I hate Percy.) Ron is not my favourite person unfortunately, because I think he's very self-obsessed and I do find him irritating at times. BUUUUT MRS. WEASLEY IS SO FEIRCE AND WONDERFUL.+ Also Luna...although I wish she had a bigger part. Maybe she will in future books?! I love her and her whimsical attitude. She's totally fascinating.+ And Neville is amazing. I particularly love how when Harry was teaching the secret Dark Arts class how Neville was just THRIVING. He didn't feel threatened, and he had one-on-one help with a peer he likes and respect. EQUALS = HIM DOING SO WELL. YAY!! I feel so so annoyed at this book too because I feel Neville has a learning disability and everyone just ignores it. Some teachers do a bit more, but mostly he gets abused - by teachers and students alike. I knoooow stuff like that happens IRL. But we're not reading real life are we??? We're reading about a WIZARD school and I'll be damned if I don't sit here and demand things like learning disabilities should be given respect and help. I love Neville. KEEP FIGHTING NEVILLE.+ And no matter how much I complain...I actually lost track of time while reading this!! That's right! I was reading and my eyes were burning at night and I was like \"OMG WHAT'S THE TIME?!\" so I totally read a lot later than I would usually. A book that absorbs me is definitely a good book.SEE?! I DO LIKE IT. Mostly. (I hated Umbridge of course, but duh. Who doesn't?) Ultimately it was too big and I got a wrist sprain just holding the jolly hardback, BUT! It's intense and magical and intriguing and I want to know what happens next.

Harry had hard times (from the first to the last) in different sort of ways; angry, under pressure, self-struggling, mad, sad. I knew how he felt; I was angry with him, at ministry's reaction & how they treated him after all he'd been through, it was not fair. But he stood up for what was right, the truth, not the sweet lies, or what was easy; even if he would be punished.

It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.", "\nSO many feels!!!I really love this book.

I didn't want him to die :(... Overall, I really liked this book, but I think it was way too long, it had some chapters that weren't relevant to the story...

I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long.

There's blackout here ;_;  4.9 Stars \n'Yeah' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.' \nI supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually...okay let's begin with Cho Chang. \nI Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho Chang\nI totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much :   \u279c He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. \u279c 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' \u279c 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.\u279c 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' \u279c 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -''I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -''Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.'I wasn't going to! she shouted.'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.''Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. \u279c 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?''I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly,'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : \u2764 Ginny is funny \u2764 Ginny is not a crybaby \u2764 Ginny is brave \u2764 Ginny is more beautiful than Cho\u2764 She is basically more perfect than Cho \nI Don't Like Harry's Temper \nI know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione.  'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly.'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.'There was a short pause.'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice.'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking.oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rudeI know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius! \nI Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius\nWith another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed.OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! \u2764\u2764P.S.

The kind of heartwarming love that is meant to be against all odds. The kind of love that leaves you smiling just reading about it. I opened the book and found myself immersed in Laurie and Jack's story. It was exactly what I needed. An addictive, unputdownable, angsty love story that filled my heart with a solid dose of romance. The story is told from both Jack and Laurie's perspectives, starting from the snowy December day they find themselves on opposite sides of a misty bus window, inexplicably drawn to each other. The moment is brief but the bond it forms within them is strong and leaves them both marked. Can they find each other again or was this doomed to be a missed, fleeting moment in both their lives?This is not a typical love story. It unfolds over the course of ten, angst filled years! In the decade following the moment they first laid eyes on each other we follow Laurie and Jack's ups and downs, their heartaches and relationships, misunderstandings and of course their friendship and undeniable connection. They may have the world's worst timing and a seemingly impossible road to love and happiness together but you can't help but root for them while wondering - will they ever actually get to be together? \nDo you believe in destiny? That we all have that one perfect match - the person we are meant to be with!\n\nOne Day in December\n was charming, complex and romantic. Laurie and Jack are perfectly flawed and the kind of well written characters that feel like friends you want to shake and yell at for not being honest about their feelings. Every romantic at heart needs this book in their life!", "Laurie sees a man outside of her bus window one day. There are no words, no actions, only intense eye contact but that is enough to make her fall head over heels in love with a stranger. She years for him, she can't stop thinking about him, she dreams of the time they will meet again. Then one day her best friend and roommate, Sarah, introduces her new boyfriend, Jack, to Laurie. Sarah is anxious for Jack and Laurie to meet. She hopes they will hit it off - if only she knew that her boyfriend is the man from the bus. The man that Laurie has been dreaming about.... and he is dating her roommate. UGH!Bring on the angst, the heartbreak, the not wanting to hurt anyone, the wanting to be happy and the quest for the happily ever after. This book follows Laurie, Sarah and Jack through ten years of their friendship. Through their love for each other, their friendship(s), their lovers, their unrequited feelings. This is not a typical love story. It's a slice out of three people's lives. The story is told through Laurie and Jacks perspectives. The reader is privy to their secret thoughts and feelings. This book has heart. I like that these people cared deeply for each other and as a reader, I cared about them. I found this book to be addictive. I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen to these characters. This is a great book to curl up with a blanket with. My only complaint with this book is that I wanted an epilogue. When the book ended, I thought \"Come On!\". I wanted just a little bit more time with these characters. I found this book to be engaging, fun and a very enjoyable read. It has a little bit of everything: friendship, loss, grief, new beginnings, forgiveness, heartache, and love.Thank you to Crown Publishing and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

She looks out the window and notices a guy sitting in a bus shelter absorbed in a hardcover book. He lifts his head and sees the girl staring at him. Their eyes meet. They communicate wordlessly \u2026 I am on page 7 and I'm already grumbling. Not about the insta-love, although, really? Not even about the irritating first-person narration, which somehow I find irksome mostly in romance novels. I would just like to know how is it possible to \u201d stare straight at each other\" when one is sitting on the top deck of a double-decker bus in London and the other person is sitting in a bus shelter, with a roof I assume, head down reading. Did I mention it happened on 21st December \u2013 the shortest day of the year when at 4 pm it\u2019s already dark? Besides the fact that I was incredulous that a young man would read a hardcover book, in winter, when it\u2019s dark outside, while waiting for the bus, I would just like to know how it is possible for two people on different levels, in pretty close proximity, distance-wise, to achieve the staring contest. It\u2019s physically unlikely. But hey, let\u2019s not let something as stupid as the laws of physics derail our enjoyment of this love story. The twenty-two-year-old and her best friend and roommate, Sarah, spend what seems like the entire year looking for the \u201cbus guy\u201d, in bars and so on. None of them thought about taking the bus at the same time or waiting in the said bus stop around the same time. I guess that would be too logical. Right \u2026 moving on. Guess who falls in love with \u201cyour bus guy\u201d \u2013 your best friend, Sarah. Poor Laurie, she\u2019s lost the love of her life\u2026 Give me a break. She saw the dude for one minute. Besides, once she got to know Jack, there wasn\u2019t anything special to admire about him. He was as interesting as a wet dishrag. Not that Laurie was miss excitement or had much of a personality either. Apparently, she had blue-purple eyes and dark hair \u2013 yeah right. That would make her striking. But according to Laurie, she wasn\u2019t the gorgeous one, her best friend, Sarah, was. Alright \u2026 Sarah seems to have more of a personality and since she was gorgeous and sleeping with Jack, I found it very hard to believe that Jack would pine for Laurie, because, what? they saw each other through a window? Do men operate like that? Nope.Given it's an English novel, I expected some good ol\u2019 British humour, sarcasm, banter, I love banter! \u2013 but there was no banter! :-( Those are the best bits about starting up a relationship. Something tells me the author is a coffee drinker, because nobody drinks tea in this novel - so very un-British of them *smirk. Besides a lot of alcohol drinking and getting drunk (one of the very few things about this novel that were life-like), there\u2019s very little of anything else. Even douchebag Jack, who\u2019s a DJ, never mentions music. The only movies they briefly mention are Twilight and Grease. Ok\u2026 Oh, I forgot, The Great Gatsby is apparently highbrow literature (don't they study it in high school in the States?).Josie Silver does a whole lot of telling, very little showing. Laurie keeps telling everyone, and Jack, that they're best friends. Really? Based on what? They spent less than 50 pages together. This old romantic trope of the male best friend drives me crazy. Most of us know that women and men can\u2019t be friends, because men, young and old, won\u2019t spend time or think about a woman they don\u2019t want to sleep with. I mean friendship as in the kind you share intimacies and personal things, not the hanging out type.One Day in December was cliche and there were lots of things that irked me:-\tAnnoying first-person narration with two points of view, Jack\u2019s point of view, only reinforcing his douchebag qualities. -\tToo much telling not enough showing, actually, it\u2019s all telling; -\tThe novel's structure didn\u2019t work for me, too many vignettes, not enough meat to the story;-\tThe worst thing was that the two main characters, Laurie and Jack, were flat, unidimensional and I didn't feel their chemistry and, basically, didn't care one way or another about them.As far as I\u2019m concerned One Day in December  was boring, trite, uninspired and lacklustre.Who wants my paperback?", "5 Heartfelt, Love-Sick Stars!What happens when see him? It\u2019s love at first sight, and then your best friend meets him in person and she gets the guy? For Laurie, there is a moment. Just one. Perhaps it is Kismet or maybe it's Destiny. She sees him at the bus stop. Laurie is inside, he is waiting outside, he looks up at the exact moment she does, their eyes meet and hold and she knows. He is the one. For a year, she looks for him everywhere, but never finds him. Her crush goes unrequited. Her best friend and roommate Sarah, jokes about him constantly. Yet Laurie knows, her feelings for him are true. Laurie and Sarah met while at Uni. They are two peas in a pod, besties till the end of the world. One night, they have a party and Sarah brings her new boyfriend, Jack O\u2019Mara. Laurie meets his eyes and she is gutted. Jack is the guy, her crush, yet she says nothing. Jack recognizes Laurie instantly. He too, has thought about her. How could he not? And yet,.. he is with Sarah now. Told in both Laurie and Jack\u2019s alternating viewpoints and spanning the course of several years, there are missed chances, choices and loads of heartache and tears. As the years passed by, I felt that tightness in my chest that made my throat close up and my heart pound. The pain was palpable, the feelings of jealousy and heartbreak were as real as any I\u2019ve ever felt personally.\u201cOne Day in December\u201d by Josie Silver is a novel that broke my heart time and again. My eyes filled and yes, I had to grab a tissue or two because I couldn\u2019t stop myself from crying. Ultimately, this is a story that will make you feel\u2026 whether you are unabashedly romantic or not, your heart will soften and you will not be able to stop yourself from wondering, from having hope that it is out there and from showing everyone you love how much you care. If you get the chance to read \u201cOne Day in December\u201d please take it! This heartwarming read will be on my best of list for 2018 and I sincerely hope it will be on yours too!This was another weekend buddy read with Kaceey!Thank you to Emily at Goodreads, Eliana at Crown Publishing and to Josie Silver for a complimentary copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Published on Goodreads, Twitter, Amazon on 12.7.18.Excerpt posted on Instagram.", "\nHeartwarming!One Day in December is a sweet story about friendship, romance, and true love. \nThe plot centers around a romance that could have been but was not. Instead, wrong matches are made, friendships are put to the test, and the notion of true love is tested. This is the story of Laurie, Sarah, and Jack. Told through Laurie and Jack\u2019s alternating POV\u2019s, the reader learns over the course of time of what was not but what should have been. Will true love prevail or will one be left heartbroken?What I liked about One Day in December is that all of the characters are likable. Even when they are with the wrong romantic matches, the \u201cwrong\u201d partner is never villainized, rather things don\u2019t work out because the wrong match was made. The plot isn\u2019t wholly original and it is a little predictable, but the depth of characters and Laurie\u2019s compelling narrative makeup for these issues. I appreciated that the characters had depth and evolve over the course of the story. Prior to reading this, I was in a bit of a reading slump. Nothing fit or felt quite right until I read One Day in December.  This turned out to be the perfect holiday read as it took away my reading frustrations and brought me into the holiday cheer! ", "Josie Silver writes a romantic comedy that is absolutely going to be a big hit, with characters that tug at your heartstrings and packed with laugh out loud humour. It is perfect escapist fare that begins and ends in the festive season. It's December, Laurie doesn't believe in soul mates, but with her hair covered in tinsel, she is at a bus stop in London on a crowded bus heading to her parents home in Birmingham for Christmas. Through the misted window, she sees him outside and deep inside her she just knows he is the one. When he glances up and spots her, his reaction is mirroring her. However, Laurie doesn't get off the bus and he doesn't get on, and that chance for the two of them is missed. However, Laurie can't forget him, and spends the following year desperately hoping to come across him. Laurie's best friend Sarah is as close as a sister to her, they laugh, have fun and support each other unconditionally. Sarah is head over heels in love with her new boyfriend, certain he is the man she will marry, and she is desperate for Laurie's approval. To Laurie's horror, Sarah's new man is Jack O'Mara, her bus stop man, the one. Laurie buries her feelings, her friendship with Sarah is too precious as she tries hard to rein in her feelings and not show her heartbreak. Through the following decade we follow Laurie, her new year resolutions, the kicks and bruises that life hands out that leave her broken, being a pink lady, her never tell a goldfish moments and meeting Oscar in Thailand. Will she and Jack ever get together? If you are feeling under the weather, or if life is too much or is getting you down, this is a great book for giving you a lift. Josie Silver has written a gripping contemporary romantic fairytale with verve, wit and panache. A beautifully told story of love, of tears, of loss, of friendship, and regrets, with characters you cannot help but care for. Highly recommended! Many thanks to Penguin UK for an ARC.", "this is a tricky book for me to rate and review. my immediate reaction is that i enjoyed it - hence the 4 stars. i must be a glutton for heartache, because \u2018missed chances at love\u2019 is a romance trope i quite enjoy (ie. one day and november 9), even though it breaks my heart at times. there is just something so rewarding about seeing two people finally find their way to each other after many years of fighting for it and this book is a perfect example of that. i especially loved seeing the character growth over the 10 years the story takes place. it made for a really enjoyable reading experience.that being said, if i took the time to dissect and nitpick this much more thoroughly, i think would find a lot wrong with the story. there are plenty of other reviews that shed light on problematic issues, so i feel content enough not to go through all that. i think i will just keep my thoughts focused on the positive aspects of this book and see it for the heartfelt and touching story that it can be. \u21a0 3.5 stars", "4, \ud83c\udfb6 do you believe in love \ud83c\udfb6 stars!!! Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read!It all begins one day in December (I know, shocker, you had no idea). We start our story with Laurie, she doesn't believe in love at first sight, she's having a normal run of the mill day, then\u00a0BOOM\u00a0she sees a man outside her bus window. As their eyes meet, she feels an instant connection. Laurie's brain shorts out and she does nothing as the bus pulls away, she then runs through endless possibilities of what she could have done, what she\u00a0should\u00a0have done in that moment.\u00a0From now on, if anyone asks me if I've ever fallen in love at first sight, I shall say yes, for one glorious minute on 21 December 2008.Even though it was just one fleeting moment between Laurie and Jack (AKA \"Bus Boy\") she spends the next year looking for him everywhere she goes. She sees him in bars, at bus stops, in shops because she can't even begin to fathom that it wasn't destiny passing her by. Of course, fate had far bigger things planned for Laurie and Jack and they do reconnect. Only this time, it's on the arm of her best friend Sarah.\u00a0This is told from alternating POVs between Jack and Sarah. As we receive Jack's point of view, it turns out he actually did recognize Laurie - and he remembers the many times he thought about her after their chance encounter at the bus stop as well. However, nothing in life is ever easy and he genuinely does care for Sarah, so he attempts a friendship with Laurie, despite it's difficulty.\u00a0You tread lightly through life, but you leave deep footprints that are hard for other people to fill.There was an immediate cinematic quality to this and I will be truly shocked if it doesn't get made into a movie in the near future. This story follows 10 years between Laurie, Jack and Sarah and their ever changing relationships with one another, along with people they meet along the way. While it's a fairly traditional romance there was something effortlessly engaging here that keeps the reader attached to not just the story, but the characters as well.Who was St Valentine anyway and what made him such an expert on romance? I\u2019m willing to bet his full name is St Smugbastard-three\u2019s-crowd Valentine, and he probably lives on a candle-lit island where everything comes in pairs, even bouts of thrush.What's great is that Silver doesn't just rely on angst here, while it's there in spades there's also a levity and humor that carries throughout the story. This isn't just about the dreaded love triangle, betrayal or friendships and relationships lost and found. No, it's about life, about it's triumphs and failures, about success and loss, about growth and learning who we are. While this ultimately fell just a bit short for me because it was quite predictable, I absolutely loved the story Silver wove and it's a quick, incredibly fun read that I had a really fun time with.\u00a0I'd suggest this for fans of romance or anyone looking for a quick, fun and cozy winter read!Thank you to the ever amazing Traveling Sisters for facilitating this group read and providing us with physical ARCs!!!", "LOOOVED IT!!! Every page, every sentence, every word, every letter!!!In case you cannot tell I have fallen head over heels in love with this book! It has earned a place on my fave shelf and is absolutely one of my top five reeds of 2018... such a beautiful story, so full of love and heart.... this is an epic love story spanning an entire decade... a story with all the feels, you will laugh, you will cry, you will smile, you will shake your head, you will fall in love... this book will break your heart over and over again and then fill it back up with love just as many times! Simply put it was MAGICAL!Laurie doesn\u2019t believe in love at first sight until she glimpses a boy at the bus stop...Laurie was such a wonderful character so well developed, I felt as though I would know her if she were walking down the street... adored her friendship with Sarah, one of my absolute favorite parts of this book... such a positive realistic portrayal of what a female friendships should be.... of course they have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day they were always there for one another.... all three of the main characters in this book Laurie, Sarah, and Jack were well drawn likable characters that you definitely could relate to...Told from alternating points of view... we got the insights and perceptions of both Laurie and Jack threwout the decade... The book was structured brilliantly you never were confused as to who was narrating and what year it was... in fact the entire book is told linearly, there was no jumping around kind of nice for a change....I absolutely recommend this stunning story to everyone with a heart! A wonderful Christmas read!This was a group read with my Book Besties... Jennifer was approached by Goodreads and the publisher with this book and just as a true friend does she included all of us! How appropriate for a group of friends to read a story with such a tremendous focus on friendship... we had a wonderful discussion, we were all captivated by this story! We also thought it would make a fantastic movies, we even casted it... I thought I\u2019d share our choices with you all!Laurie we thought should be played bye Shailene Woodley, Sarah played by Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack buy either Liam Hemsworth or Zac Efron... have you read this? What do you think?*** huge thanks to Goodreads, Crown Publishing, and Jennifer for my copy of this book ***", "\u201dWe stare straight at each other and I can\u2019t look away. I feel my lips move as if I\u2019m going to say something, God knows what, and all of a sudden and out of nowhere I need to get off this bus. I\u2019m gripped by the overwhelming urge to go outside, to get to him. But I don\u2019t.\u201dEvery once in a while there comes a book I don\u2019t want to write about. Not because it wasn\u2019t good (quite the contrary) but because reading it was such a unique and amazing experience that I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for anyone. \u201cOne Day in December\u201d definitely falls into this category and I\u2019m having a tough time deciding what to write about it. XD Maybe it\u2019s best to start with the obvious story line that\u2019s already mentioned in the synopsis. Laurie and Sarah are best friends that share everything with each other. From their flat up to their secrets and lives, they are always together and do everything as a pair. Well, and then that fateful day happens when Laurie falls in love with a stranger who sits at a bus stop and tries to find him for an entire year. \u201dI\u2019m in hell. I hate myself. I take a couple of steps away from him for my own sanity and grapple with my wretched heart to stop it banging louder than the music.\u201d Of course Sarah knows everything about him. Or well, as much as Laurie could tell her because it was just a passing moment and other than the fact that he read a book (of course he did) and how he looked, Laurie actually doesn\u2019t have any details about him. How could she? She just saw him through a bus window. So in the end the universe does was it does best and messes things up big time. *lol* (Me a cynic, never! XD) So through the twisted ways of fate Jack O\u2019Mara (the guy from the bus station) ends up as Sarah\u2019s boyfriend and they are so happy that Laurie would rather die than to mention that he\u2019s HER bus boy! What follows is life with its inevitable ups and downs that keep our three protagonists more than just busy. They live and love, they grieve and hope, they move on and return, they give up on themselves and they reinvent themselves once again. Over the course of nine years their story unfolds and just like in normal life the twists and turns keep coming. \u201dThere\u2019s something about living in a different place that allows you to be whoever you want to be.\u201dWhat I really loved about this book were the friendships and how everything that happened felt so real. I mean 9 years is a long time and we all know that there can happen so much! Yet, those three people still stayed strong. In one way or another they were always there for each other and helped each other through difficult times. No matter what happened to them and no matter how far they lived from each other, their friendships never faltered. Yes, there were some serious bumps along the road but that\u2019s just the way life is and in the end they always found each other again. \u201dBut I also said that sometimes, rarely, people can come back into your life. And if that happens, you should keep those people close to you for ever.\u201dI swear there were so many moments my heart broke for those three and sometimes all I wanted to do was to rip the book in two. *lol* I was so emotionally invested in this that it felt like they were my friends and naturally I only wanted them to be happy! XD Sometimes they were and I was glad for those moments, but other times they were so unhappy that I felt myself hurting with them. >_<\u201dI\u2019d lost sight of who I was, and you made me remember. I don\u2019t think I ever said thank you, so I\u2019m saying it now. Thank you. You tread lightly through life, but you leave deep footprints that are hard for other people to fill.\u201d\u201dHey, hey, hey.\u201d I speak as softly as I can. \u201cI know, sweetie, I know.\u201d I wish with all of my heart that I could hold her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Laurie, it\u2019s all right, sweetheart.\u201d I close my eyes, because her grief is so raw it hurts me to hear it.Gosh, I really loved this! In fact I loved this book so damn much that I stayed up until midnight just to finish the last 200 pages! And I had to get up at 5:00 a.m again so that says quite a lot about my enjoyment! *lol* Needless to say that I cried at the ending and went to bed as an emotional wreck. XD Still, it was worth every minute and I can\u2019t thank my friends enough for recommending this to me. \u201dIt\u2019s always been like this with us, hasn\u2019t it? \u201c I don\u2019t have any control over the words spilling from my mouth. \u201cWhen you look at me, I know that you really see me. I don\u2019t think anyone ever has, Lu. Not the way you do.\u201dConclusion:This was legit one of the best romances I ever read and I loved every second of it. Josie Silver managed to capture the currents of life like no other and she did it so masterfully that I\u2019m convinced her characters are actually real people! Laurie James and Jack O\u2019Mara just became one of my favourite couples and I wish them all the best! (Yes, they are real! I\u2019m convinced they are! *lol*) This said: Happy reading! ;-)\u201dSometimes you just meet the right person at the wrong time,\u201d I say softly.\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then you spend every day afterwards wishing that time could be rearranged.\u201dAnd because I don\u2019t want to spoil anyone I\u2019ll write some of my other thoughts in here:(view spoiler)[If there was one thing I didn\u2019t like about the book then it was that Laurie and Jack kissed while he was still with Sarah! I mean I can understand why they did it and I know why they kept it from her but it was no surprise that Sarah was angry when she found out. To kiss your best friends boyfriend is just a no-go and I was actually kind of angry with them when they did it. After that they should have come clean with Sarah and should have told her. Not to mention that I didn\u2019t understand why Laurie didn\u2019t tell her right from the start. I don\u2019t think Sarah would have ripped her head off is she would have told her. I mean she\u2019s her bestie, she would have understood! Who knows maybe Sarah and Jack would have even realized that they are not enough for each other way earlier than they did in the end. Or they would have made the same mistake but at least they would have tried with an honest and clean slate. You never know. Also I don\u2019t think that Oscar was a good husband. Maybe a good man but definitely no good husband. The mere fact that he took the job in Brussels and didn\u2019t even think about declining and saying \u201cno\u201d was proof of it. I mean he had a wife, they were about to start a family and he simply overrode Laurie\u2019s veto! How egoistic can you be? A marriage is about compromises and finding a way that works for both! It\u2019s no wonder Laurie left him in the end! Which woman in her right mind would have stayed with such an egoistic douche? To move to another country and to start a life over there is a huge step! You can\u2019t just expect that your wife will follow you blindly and will give up her entire life! Especially if she already told you that she doesn\u2019t want to take that step! I mean WTH???!! And last but not least: The ending killed me!!! I cried so much when I read their conversation on the radio and the twitter hashtags were one of the most relatable things ever. I just loved how everything came together in the end and that their love ended up being public. It\u2019s such a great love story it was bound to come out one day! Also SARAH IS THE FREAKING BEST FRIEND EVER! To buy Laurie a ticket to Jack was one of the most selfless things she could have possibly done and I only love her even more for it! <333  (hide spoiler)]_____________________________This book has been on \u201cMy Book List 2019\u201d ever since it was recommended to me but I waited until December to read it. I mean it\u2019s called \u201cOne Day in December\u201d so it kind of begged to be read in this last month of the year, right? *lol*Also I\u2019m kind of in awe how many of my friends already read and liked this! If it wouldn\u2019t have been recommended to me I would have never known this book even exists.

Of course, it was the best way to go! Of course, I recommend you doing the same! Of course, I am convinced you will love it as much as I did!!I would describe this story as sophisticated chick-lit.

It was the perfect emotional, real Christmas romance that I wanted. This won\u2019t be for everyone. It has a fair share of angst and some romance tropes that don\u2019t land for everyone. But sometimes life is a bit messy and this depicted that fact so well. I will be doing a full review (and possibly a gush?!?) on my channel. ", "Smashing, engrossing & devouring!Wow!

It had me totally absorbed, entertained, and interested in the storyline right from the very first page. The way that this story was told and presented was actually much more than your typical love story. It was such a powerful and moving story that had so much heart and warmth flowing through the pages of this book that I absolutely could not get enough of. I\u2019m actually kind of a little disappointed that the story was over. It definitely left me yearning for more but in a good way though.JOSIE SILVER delivers an engaging, intriguing and beautifully written tale of love, friendship, hope, longing, loss and regret that flowed so perfectly.

Huge thank you to Crown Publishing and Netgalley for the opportunity to read this arc in exchange for my honest review.Expected publication date: 10/16/18Review published to GR: 7/27/18", "Reading One Day in December is a like a getting a warm hug on a chilly winter day. It warmed our hearts and left us feeling like we just experienced something very special. I have been talking about a few books I have read lately that have not been my normal and One Day in December was definitely one of them. This sister does not have a romantic bone in her. My poor husband.One Day in December is warm, captivating, unforgettable and quirky love story not only between couples but within a friendship as well. It\u2019s a story of friendship, loyalty, and missing chances that left us questioning if they really were.Sometimes I think I am more romantic when it comes to friendships. I envied the relationship our main characters Laurie and Sarah had. Both characters were so different from each yet similar in some ways. One of the things that makes this story so great is how it is told over a long period of time. We really get the chance to connect to the characters and see them develop, change, and experience different things. The dynamic between the characters seemed realistic and was heartwarming and truly special.One Day in December made for one of the best group discussions we have had. We received a group kit with discussion questions and it had some of the best questions we have yet used. You can find them online as well. The questions are very thought-provoking, easy to answer and really related to the theme, insight and emotions we felt towards the story.We highly recommend this one and think it is one to put on your do not miss list. If you get the chance to read it in a group we suggest taking it as its one of the best stories to discuss. You could always join the Traveling Friends. This is one I am definitely going to suggest they read.*Thank you so much to Emily from Goodreads for making this spectacular Traveling Sisters group read possible!*Thank you so much to Crown Publishing and Josie Silver for gifting us the Perfect Night In book club kit and sending out copies to some of The Traveling Sisters. It was an absolute pleasure reading this incredible book!https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/2...", "Five stars to this treasure of a book and five stars to the unforgettable experience of reading it! \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f I\u2019m honored and humbled that Goodreads selected me to receive a book club kit and set of copies of One Day in December, graciously provided by the publisher, Broadway Books and Crown Publishing. I was fortunate to have local friends and online friends join me for this heartwarming read, the perfect story to enjoy this time of year, and quite uplifting in the end.It\u2019s close to the holidays, December 21 to be exact, when Laurie is bewildered and exhausted riding the bus home from work. She just so happens to make eye contact with a guy at the bus stop, and she has an instant connection, something she never believed in before. He tries to get on the bus, but it\u2019s too late. The doors close, and off Laurie goes. She makes it her New Year\u2019s Resolution to find the bus stop guy.For a year, she searches for him at every bus stop and bar in London (amazing setting, by the way!). Never finding him, she attends a Christmas party where she is introduced to HIM as her best friend Sarah\u2019s new boyfriend!Ten years go by between these friends, and they experience their share of kindness, heartbreak, disconnects, and could there possibly be second chances?I loved this story from start to finish. The formatting and timeline added interest and even more investment on my part. I found this a cozy, charming read, the characterization was warmhearted, and overall, it was a delicious escape, one where happiness is the ultimate goal. One Day in December is much more than the typical romance read, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s receiving universal love from readers across genres. I hope I can speak for the group in saying that many found this book one of the their favorites of the year, if not their top favorite. We are all avid readers, so that\u2019s saying something. Thank you again to Broadway Books, Crown Publishing, and Goodreads for this special opportunity and for the free books. All opinions are my own.My reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com", "It was a scene from one of the hopelessly romantic movies she loves: one late afternoon just before Christmas, Laurie is packed sardine-like onto a double-decker bus, when through a misty window she spots a handsome man. Some mystical force tells her that he is the one, and when their eyes meet, it's like they both know this to be true. But before Laurie can move or the man can try to board the bus and hopefully sweep her off her feet, the bus drives away.Even though she's almost certain that \"Bus Boy\" may never come back into her life, she spends a year looking for him at every bus stop, shop, bar, everywhere she goes. She can't imagine finding anyone else. And just as she gives up hope that she'll ever be reunited with her mystery man, they finally do connect\u2014only he's on the arm of her best friend and flatmate, Sarah. Yes, \"Bus Boy,\" whose name is Jack (and who is more handsome than she even imagined), is Sarah's new boyfriend, a man she's fallen head over heels for.Part of Laurie wants to tell Sarah the truth, that Jack is the man she has been hunting for. But when Jack doesn't seem to recognize her, she realizes she has been hanging on to a foolish obsession, and how can she stand in the way of her best friend's happiness? Of course, Sarah doesn't make it easy for Laurie, since she wants the three of them to spend lots of time together, and more importantly, she wants Laurie and Jack to be friends, too.Jack actually did recognize Laurie, and he can't believe that the woman he may have had more than one or two fantasies about is actually his new girlfriend's best friend. But Laurie and Sarah are complete opposites, and he doesn't want to jeopardize what he's starting to have with Sarah. Even if it's difficult to try and be friends with Laurie, if it means that much to Sarah, he'll put any lingering feelings he has aside and do it.Is there such a thing as destiny? Is there really one right person for everyone? How can you be happy when someone you truly care about gets what you want, what you think should be \"yours\"? Can you move on with your life if your heart isn't quite ready to let go?\nOne Day in December\n follows Laurie, Jack, and Sarah through 10 years of heartaches and triumphs, passion and anger, connections and misunderstandings, secrets and facing the truth. If ever there were a book that highlights how important it is to say what you feel, what you think, when it happens, it's this one.If reading the plot summary in my review gives you ideas of how this book will unfold, you may be right. There isn't anything too surprising here, but that doesn't matter, because Josie Silver's appealing yet flawed characters grow on you, even though you want to shake them at times for not saying how they feel. It's a charming, romantic book, sure to warm the hearts of those looking for a good story about love and friendship and how one can get in the way of the other.I thought this was going to be a breezy, mindless read, but it's a little more complex than I expected. I really enjoyed this, even though I would have liked it more if we didn't run through the same situations with the characters so many times. It definitely appealed to the sap, err, romantic in me though!!See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.", "4.5 starsThis book is all about fate, timing, and star-crossed love, told with a side of humor and a lot of heart. You\u2019re not a romance reader? Neither am I! But this book melted my non-romance reading heart into a puddle.In short, I loved it. It turned out to be so much more than I expected. I loved the characters of Laurie, Sarah, and Jack. I also enjoyed how the author explored the friendship between Laurie and Sarah, best friends for life, through thick and thin. We follow these three through ten years, 2008 to 2018. Each year starts off with Laurie\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolutions and we hear both Laurie and Jack\u2019s POV. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t decide how I wanted this messy situation to end up and I changed my mind several times throughout. Things are not always how they appear and there are a few surprises in store. The book ends in the year 2018 and you won\u2019t read any spoilers here. I closed the last page with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. \u2028Don\u2019t let your dislike of the genre miss this gem!

This is an extremely engaging story about a love-at-first-sight scenario, set during the Christmas holidays (nine Christmases actually), but it can definitely be read any time of the year. I was fortunate enough to read it during the wintertime, which was glorious with all the atmospheric descriptions of London during the holidays.A girl on a bus (Laurie) sees a guy at a bus stop (Jack), and their eyes meet. There's an instant connection, and they just know, you know? But then... the bus pulls away, pulling them apart.Ever since that day, Laurie and Jack have been trying to find their way back to each other.BUT... this story is also about an incredibly deep friendship between two young women (Laurie and Sarah), best friends who would do absolutely anything for each other, and that relationship is the real gem here. This one will warm your heart and make you smile.", "4 stars! Charming. Witty. Endearing. Refreshing. Heartwarming.I do not generally read romance, but when Brenda and Norma offered the Traveling Sisters the opportunity to read this title, I thought I would take a chance and try it out. I am SO GLAD I did! This is not your typical love story. This novel follows Laurie who believes she has found \u201cthe one\u201d when she happens to look through the window of the bus she is on and makes magical eye contact with a handsome stranger. She doesn\u2019t believe in love at first sight, yet she feels an unexplainable intense connection to this man as her bus drives away. Along with the help of her best friend Sarah, Laurie spends the next year scouring the city in the hopes of reuniting with this handsome stranger. Over a year later, Laurie does reunite with this man, named Jack, although it is not in the way she had hoped\u2026.. This book spans over a decade in which we follow the ever-changing relationship dynamic between Laurie, Sarah and Jack. The author, Josie Silver, does an outstanding job with character development. I was completely invested in their lives and I simply adored Laurie. The pace and flow of the story was perfect which is impressive considering the many time jumps throughout the plot. I loved the \u2018New Year\u2019s Resolution\u2019 sections \u2013 they were a brilliant addition to the novel.This was a Traveling Sister read which we all adored!

The plot was heartwarming and predictable, but the people in it had a lot more life to it than your run of the mill storyline. Thankfully, the angst and witty narration kept me going during this book where there was a distinct absence of any smut or sexiness, and I did end up teary by the end. Still, it wasn't a new favorite of the year, but it was a nice enough Christmassy read. I will say right off the bat that you won't enjoy this if you detest books with cheating in it. I found it done tastefully--if you'll excuse my calling cheating tasteful--because it explored the emotional ramifications and actually dealt the characters consequences. One unforgivable thing to me, however, was the timeline of this book. It skips to certain portions of their lives over 9 years, and with these abrupt changes in time, several plot points were scattered in as a \"Oh hey, by the way, this happened since we last talked\" rather than a gradual development. By the years being so choppy, it almost distanced the two characters in my mind rather than heightened the angst. I'm torn on whether I would read another book by this author because although I liked it, I wasn't wowed by it. I still say give it a go if you'd like to read something sappy that talks about relationships and hardships within them, but I would call it more of a contemporary than the steamy romance I was expecting.", "Properly kitschy and feel-good.

(c)", "Unputdownable! Yes, this book is that good! I read One Day in December over the course of one day, here in December. I liked the story right away and just couldn\u2019t stop reading it. Laurie takes the bus home one evening in 2008 and locks eyes with a guy through the window who\u2019s a total babe. He isn\u2019t able to get on the bus before it pulls away. Devastated, Laurie spends the next year hunting throughout London for him, with no luck. She does end up meeting him again though, when her best friend, Sarah, introduces him as Jack, her boyfriend. The story spans the course of a decade (2008-2018) as this triangle attempts to navigate difficult situations involving both friendships and relationships, along with family and careers. I thoroughly enjoyed this story! I enjoyed the style it was written in - Each year beginning with New Year\u2019s resolutions from Laurie, followed by major updates or the progression of events that took place during that time period. The story is told from both Laurie and Jack\u2019s POVs. Overall I felt like Laurie, Jack, and Sarah were pretty likable and I liked the modern time frame of the novel. This was a great story, and while hopefully never challenged with all the difficulties this group faced, there are definitely relatable feelings and elements. It is a romance story which I\u2019m not often drawn to, but this one is not cheesy, unbelievable, or over the top. Two of my all-time favorite books are The Light We Lost and This Love Story Will Self-Destruct. This one reminded me of both in certain ways, particularly with the main characters seeming to be of my generation, and the longer course of time in which the story takes place. That said, this story didn\u2019t feel too similar to either of those books. Highly recommend One Day in December for anyone looking for a moving read that runs the full gamut of emotions. I can\u2019t wait to see what Josie Silver writes next!", "Firstly, thank you to the TBR-jar gods for selecting this bloody brilliant book for me!I do not consider myself a romance reader and it wouldn't be a stretch to say that I opened this one up with a fair amount of trepidation. I actually believe one of my comments upon starting was that I thought chances were 50/50 that I would DNF it. That thought now seems utterly ridiculous!I am floored by how much I loved this story.The humor was perfect for me. I loved the pace and I fully appreciated how it was messy and frustrating and never easy. So is life, am I right?It's a long book but upon finishing I feel that it couldn't have been any shorter. To get the full impact of missed chances requires a long scope and that is exactly what this book delivers.I felt like past-Meg, who watched Bridget Jones Diary for the first time and felt, yes, finally there is a character whose love life I can relate to!I am so impressed with Ms. Josie Silver and thoroughly look forward to reading more by her in future!", "The short and sweet version: this was my favorite book of the year, everyone should read it, and it needs to be made into a movie now if not sooner!This is romance done perfectly, yet it\u2019s more than romance - it\u2019s about love and relationships and life and mistakes and forgiveness. So much in one book, wrapped up in a perfect bow that starts on that one day in December. Spanning over several years, this books takes you through the journey of Lu\u2019s life as she\u2019s coming of age after university. I can honestly say this is the most wonderful, funny, delightful trip full of ups and downs and rights and wrongs and love and pain that I\u2019ve read in quite some time. Ms. Silver, you have a forever fan. 5 magical, beautiful, lovely stars!This was a @6bookbesties read, be sure to check out reviews from Mackenzie, Kendall, Holly, Jennifer and Berit! And a huge thank you to Jennifer who included us in her book club from the publisher - I will cherish this book forever!", "Warning: This book talks about love at first sight.Pure and simple: I loved this book.\u2026and to be honest with you, it took me by surprise how much I loved it. It was a perfect book to read, with beautiful writing and fascinating story with feels that gave me shivers.The story follows Laurie who, one day in December, sees a boy and falls in love. They didn\u2019t talk, she knows nothing about him, but the chemistry and the connection they had by just looking at each other is too strong to forget.She spends a year dreaming about that boy, trying to find him and believing they were made for each other.One day, a year later, she happens to meet him, but as her best friend\u2019s boyfriend.Laurie keeps her secret with her because she doesn\u2019t want to ruin her friendship with Sarah. However, erasing Jack from her heart is not an easy task.Going into this book I thought it\u2019ll be a quick, easy read. Boy, was I wrong!I mean, reading this book was pure pleasure, but it was not a light read.It talks about love, life and human relationships, and if you ask me, it stands somewhere on the edge between women\u2019s fiction and general fiction.We follow our characters during a decade and we see what they went through during that period of time.This is pitched as a love story, and it is a love story, but it doesn\u2019t talk only about romantic love.It talks about different shapes of love: platonic love, love between lovers, friends, parents and children.It also talks about grief, falling apart, life taking you different directions, marriage and human interactions.The writing style is beautiful. Some scenes were so emotional and it takes talent to engage readers in a way Silver did.The story is written in first person, following two POVs: Laurie\u2019s and Jack\u2019s.The Christmas setting is captured excellently and the novel really gives you that festive vibe, even if the story itself doesn\u2019t take time only during Christmas.The only thing I wish for is an epilogue. I loved how the story ended, but I think with two, three pages more that talk about some time later it would be even better.I loved this book so much more then I thought I would. It is now one of my favorite Christmas stories, if not even my favorite, and I would recommend it to everyone who believes (or want to believe) in love at first sight, likes to read about friendships and life twists and turns.It\u2019s a brilliant piece of fiction.Read this and more reviews on my blog https://bookdustmagic.com "], "genre": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Chick Lit", "Contemporary", "Holiday", "Christmas"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/56132017-one-day-in-december", "avg_ratings": "3.97", "ShelvedNumber": "2035"}

Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri\u2019s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri\u2019s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it\u2014she has to make it.On the Come Up is Angie Thomas\u2019s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518828924l/35887567.jpg", "title": "On the Come Up", "authors": "Angie Thomas", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35887567-on-the-come-up", "reviews": ["It\u2019s Angie Thomas\u2019 world and she\u2019s just allowing us to live in it.You know when you finish reading a book and there's a moment that feels so remarkable it carves out a space in time and whirls there while the world rushes on around it? In that gap where your real storyline seems very abstract and you're left with such a warm and happy feeling that you're glowing just by being around the book's energy?That was me upon finishing this book. I'm still overwhelmed by the zing of feeling in my heart and I think reading Angie Thomas' books should be honestly classified as an official human emotion.\nSo, what\u2019s this book about?\n16-year-old Brianna \u201cBri\u201d Jackson has channeled all her yearning into one fervent dream: to reach rap stardom. She believes in it with as much certainty as a heart can hold.Bri\u2019s memory of her late father\u2014a legendary underground rapper who was shot dead by a rival gang when Bri was 12 years old\u2014has always been like shadows flitting at the corner of her eye, but Bri\u2019s dream always brought his ghost to stand beside her. Bri held that hope in a desperate grip as her widowed mother, a drug addict eight years clean, ekes out a living on a church secretary salary, and her older brother drudges in a minimum-wage job after years of toil for his college degree. It\u2019s what sustained Bri through the phases of dark, until the return to light. A career in rap could turn the tide of her family\u2019s life. There would be no more gray sift of days where they had to choose between electricity and gas, no more diligent waiting for the dreary future to trickle forth.Bri is also one of the few black students who attend an arts school. Following an incident where she is violently targeted by a security guard, determination burns out Bri\u2019s gathering hurt and lyrics burns bright as tinder in her mind, illuminating the dark corners. Bri speaks of her growing frustration with being discriminated against for being black, of her incontinent ambition, of her family\u2019s grinding financial situation and how her chest is weary from carrying all this repeated hope and disappointment, and the words expanded until they blotted out all else.Bri's song soon goes viral and it was like flying into a tornado. The public wrings out real meaning from her lyrics and assigns it their own. They brand Bri a dangerous, angry black girl and a \u201choodlum\u201d\u2014a word like a wall and Bri runs against it and can go no further. Bri\u2019s disgrace is encouragement, lowering her enough that everyone dares to reach up, including her father\u2019s sleazy old manager who insists Bri caters to the false image they painted of her in order to make more money. \u201cYou know what white kids in the suburbs love? Listening to shit that scares their parents,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou scare the hell outta their folks, they\u2019ll flock to you like birds.\u201dBut Bri's strength and resolution run deep. The trek is arduous but the world's wonders are unrolled like a rug before her, and the future is hers for the taking.\nGift. One word, one syllable. I don\u2019t know if it rhymes with anything because it\u2019s a word I never thought could be used when it comes to me.\nDon\u2019t let the charming exterior dupe you\u2014step into this book and it will step into you.On the Come Up is the kind of story that drags you down so deep that you\u2019re underneath thought, engulfed in a place of pure feeling. It\u2019s a powerful tale\u2014by turns tender and attentive, unyielding and sharp. It made me laugh. It made me crushingly sad. It made me feel like something was growing inside me, like the words were sinking into me and expanding in my chest and it all wanted to spill out in waves of music and silver light.Angie Thomas rolls up her sleeves and tackles Bri\u2019s story with heady mirth. On the Come Up glitters with life, and its conversational, yet profound tone is warm and magnetic when it isn't quietly devastating, and raw as a wound.There\u2019s a prodigious sense of hard, spare wanting in this book that fairly leaps off the page. Bri\u2019s passion is a welter of flame. Just as she is unstoppable and relentless for the ones she loves, she embodies that with her love for rap. She spoke her dream and promptly sealed into the world and woe betide anyone who stands in her way. Her lyrics dug at my bones and made chills shiver across my skin. I absolutely loved Bri\u2019s character. She is always running ahead, never looking to see if she is going to fall\u2014the girl who dances on the trapeze without a net, too young to always know how to keep herself on an even keel. But Bri is a whole character and Angie keeps her struggles energized and absorbing that you can almost feel it in your blood as well: that iron weight Bri had borne so long, that certain recklessness of temper, nourished by the rough world in which she found herself, which had burst thrillingly to steely determination. It was equally harrowing and thrilling to know that Bri was standing at the precipice of something new and it felt like a gift and a privilege to embark with her on this sublime campaign of life-perfecting.\n\u201cSo, who are you?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she repeats. \u201cOf the millions and billions of people in the world, you\u2019re the only person who can answer that. Not people online or at your school. I can\u2019t even answer that. I can say who I think you are.\u201d She cups my cheek. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re brilliant, talented, courageous, beautiful. You\u2019re my miracle. But you\u2019re the only one who can say who you are with authority. So, who are you?\u201d\nBut even more than that, the novel's strength lies in how it succeeds in being both a delightful romp through teenagedom, packed with charisma, firecracker dialogue and well-crafted characters, while also being a bold and illuminating commentary on racism, prejudice, double standards and homophobia. It\u2019s a difficult feat that marks Angie Thomas as a remarkable author to keep your eyes on. On the Come up is set in the same universe as The Hate U Give and the memory of THUG\u2019s tragic events are emblazoned on this book\u2019s pages. Although Starr\u2019s and Bri\u2019s lives could not be any more disparate, the book highlights how discrimination and racism touches them with the same hand, and how it is a constant feature in the lives of the American black community no matter what their socio-economic standing is. I'm excited to see the conversations this book evokes!But On the Come Up isn\u2019t all grim. The novel loosens the chokehold of anger and frustration on the reader\u2019s soul by making space for moments of comfort and vicarious happiness. It\u2019s imbued with hope like a small, mad flame flaring in a dark place as the characters learn to lift their arms to hold up their world. I loved Bri\u2019s friendship with Sonny and Malik, and how, despite the occasional quarrel and misunderstanding, they were always supportive of each other. The current of love and hurt and dwindling resentments flowing between Bri and her family also struck me with a deep poignancy.But what sang to me the most is the message that\u2019s wedged deep inside the novel\u2019s heart: Your voice matters. You don\u2019t have to bend in order to fit the world\u2019s mold. You don\u2019t have to omit pieces of yourself to ensure someone else\u2019s comfort. You don\u2019t have to stifle your opinion. You don\u2019t have to back-pedal and soften it up to cater to someone else\u2019s measure. Be wonderfully passionate about what\u2019s right. You will draw hatred and animosity no matter what you do, so you might as well make a stand and make it count for something.\nYou\u2019ll never silence me and you\u2019ll never kill my dream, Just recognize when you say brilliant that you\u2019re also saying Bri.\nOn the Come Up is equal parts heartrending, insightful, and charming, and as long as Angie Thomas continues to work her marvelous magic, she\u2019ll always have a reader in me!\u2728 wishlist \u2728 blog \u2728 twitter \u2728 tumblr \u2728", "\nAunt Pooh said I only get one chance to let everybody and their momma know who I am. So I take it.\nHow do you follow a book like The Hate U Give? Reading THUG, I got the impression that I was experiencing something momentous. It was breathtaking. Important. I was witnessing a person using their art to say loud and clear \u201cENOUGH.\u201d On the Come Up looks at some of the same things, but it is a different kind of book. I think, however, it is a book which shows that Thomas is a great writer, not just someone who can ride the wave of an important issue.Overall, people will probably like this book less than the author's debut. I've already seen some (understandable) comments about how Bri was a tough character to like compared with Starr. And it's true. Starr is a much easier character to like. She's a clear victim of a screwed-up system; clearly in the right for the whole book. She has very basic easy-to-relate-to relationships with her parents and friends and we are never asked to sympathize with hard-to-like characters. Bri is much more complex.For me, though, she was a far more interesting character than Starr. Her story may not make quite the same impact - being largely about hip hop rather than police shootings - but she herself felt like such an authentic teen voice. She's angry, resentful, impulsive, and outright rude at times. She gets into fights and doesn't play nice. She has a difficult relationship with pretty much everyone in the book. She pushes her family and supporters away, but believes she is doing it to get \u201con the come up\u201d for them. She considers giving up important parts of herself for a shot at fame and fortune.I can see why some people won't like her, but I actually kinda loved her.I felt every bit of her pain and anger as she watches her family scrape together to try to pay the bills, watches her aunt buried deep in the world of drug dealing, watches security at her school targeting black and Latinx students for searches, watches male rappers make sexist jokes or erase her name and voice because she is a girl. And I loved how she turns to hip hop to make sense of her feelings, finding rhymes in her everyday life and spinning clever verses in her head.As someone who finds books about music a bit hit and miss, I have to say this one was a definite hit. I would have welcomed even more rap. You can tell the author used to be a rapper because Bri's songs are genuinely very good. I'd love to hear them recorded. I also love how she addresses sexism and double standards in the hip hop industry, and points out the ludicrous hypocrisy of a white journalist, who is against gun controls, fearing for her children because of the guns mentioned in rap lyrics. I think this is a great contemporary. A mix of music, family dynamics, fun dialogue, social media and activism, with a protagonist who is moody and difficult and everything I love to read about. I can't wait to see what Thomas writes next.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "\"You'll never silence me and you'll never kill my dream,Just recognize when you say brilliant that you're also saying Bri.\"First of all, HAPPY BOOK BIRTHDAY and second of all THIS BOOK IS GONNA BE A FILM YOU GUYS. What a birthday present, am I right?Spoiler free!This is the 2019 release I was most scared to read. THUG was such a major, ground-breaking, and emotional book for me that the stakes for Angie\u2019s second books were mile-high. Now I can assure you that there is no need to worry. Angie will not disappoint. This book is just as essential and spectacular.I don\u2019t think I have ever read a book this black. I can\u2019t think of a single white main or side character just now. And I know this is going to bother people. Just like they are bothered when there is more than one gay character on a show. White people have been the centre of YA (and the majority of other literary genres) for decades. It is time that popular culture makes room for books that represent and celebrate all kinds of cultures as a whole. This will not only help all kinds of teenagers feel represented, but it will also help us understand each other, it will create empathy, respect, and appreciation. I\u2019m not black, I didn\u2019t grow up in a poor part of town where drugs and gangs shaped society, I have never been discriminated against because my heritage or skin colour led others to think less of me. But this book brought me closer to not only understand the struggles of what a life like Bri\u2019s includes, but also how important loyalty, family, friendship, faith, etc. are for a teenager like her.That\u2019s not all, though. Angie addresses a lot of topics that deal with respecting other people\u2019s backgrounds and stories. She does not pretend to know what is going on in a gay teenagers head but she still manages to tell his story with dignity and tact. She outright acknowledges that a gay boy\u2019s story is not hers to tell because she has not made the same experiences as a presumably straight woman. I would love to see more of that in the literature community overall, not just in YA.Let\u2019s talk about Bri while we\u2019re at it. That girl is talented, lemme tell you. I love her family and friends but I often had a hard time connecting with Bri on an emotional level. She likes to jump to conclusions and often acts without thinking about the consequences. Even when people tell her to watch out and lay low because whatever she might say or do will put her in a difficult position, she still doesn\u2019t stop to think. She keeps making that mistake over and over again and I quickly ran out of patience. Then again, she was hilarious and smart and often made me laugh out loud.The writing was great as always. Reading Angie\u2019s books makes you feel things. The lyrics to Bri\u2019s songs gave me goosebumps every single time. The dialogues between the characters were ultimately funny. So. Much. Shade.There are also a few Easter eggs in there. I am sure that I missed some of them and all I am going to say is that I love seeing authors referencing other authors and their books. Or to see them being inspired by other author\u2019s stories.The reason I\u2019m \u201conly\u201d giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of, as I have mentioned before, the lack of a deeper emotional connection. I seriously wept while reading THUG. That book destroyed me. On the Come Up did not have that effect on me. But as I said, do not let this keep you from reading the book. It is just as compelling as Angie\u2019s debut.I wonder whether we will get to see On the Come Up on the big screen. I would love to actually hear Bri perform her songs. They might become actual chart-toppers, who knows.Thank you to Walker Books for providing me with an advance copy in return for an honest review.Find more of my books on Instagram", "[4.5\ud83c\udf1f]This book was pretty fuckin phenomenal. I wasn't sure how THUG could be topped, but Angie Thomas did that!I fell in love with this story, with Brianna, her friends and family and her love for music. All those aspects were pretty much nailed and I couldn't get enough once I started reading. I'm really liking how Angie Thomas incorporates themes regarding social justice in her stories in order for us to get to know how some black communities are living and opening our eyes to it all. It's raw and real and spoken about so well and I want more. So much more!I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. Auto-buy author for sure!Also this is going to become a movie?! Lord, it's gonna be good! --------------------It's haaappening! Buddy-reading with  my babygirl T\u00fcrkan! -----------------I cannot WAIT for this. Cover love. Blurb obsessed!!

Otherwise, BIG MISTAKE because this is something the world needs and I just really want to see a teen movie with a rap battle + romance + family drama + diverse characters + fierce social involvement. Because YES.\n", "\nWhile I didn't enjoy the plot of this one quite as much as I enjoyed the plot of the Hate U Give, this book was still soOoOoOoOo GOOD. Angie Thomas' writing perfectly fits the YA genre and we are truly blessed to be living in the same lifetime as her. SO DAMN GOOD.TW: racism, drug dealing, gun violence\n", "ANGIE THOMAS!!!I am so in love with your words.This story follows, Bri Jackson, who, like Starr from THUG, lives in the neighborhood of Garden Heights. That is pretty much where the similarities end, however, between these two girls.Bri lives with her mother and her older brother. Her father, a once successful rapper, was gunned down in the streets, a victim of gang violence. Bri's mother, a recovering addict with over 5-years sobriety, is doing her best to be able to provide for her children alone, but it's tough.Bri has plans to follow in her father's footsteps and she wants to do it her own way. No matter how hard she strives, however, she struggles to find her identity apart from him. She is super talented and spends most of her time thinking up rhymes and putting together lyrics. She is singularly focused on finding success in order to better the living conditions of herself and her family. To make them 'good'.Bri is a great kid, although she has a short fuse. She puts a lot of pressure on herself and I enjoyed getting some insight into her thought process and how she sees the world around her. There is always something that seems to be going wrong in her world. It's tough. Troubles at school, troubles with bills, being behind in rent and she feels compelled to do something to make it different.I loved this story. The incorporation of Bri's lyrics gave the story such depth. I loved that angle, seeing her try to make it and channel her talents for good. Learning to stand her ground and be true to herself. I love stories with music or musicians as well and this one utilized that trope beautifully.I have read some reviews where readers commented on not enjoying this story as much as THUG. That doesn't surprise me at all but for me, I sort of feel the opposite. I think I actually enjoyed this one more. While Bri, as a character, may seem contentious, to me, she was perfect.As a 16-year old, many aspects of your life can be extremely frustrating. You can feel like you aren't being heard, like your desires are pushed aside or seen as not important, and that may cause you to act out in socially unacceptable ways. I get that. Bri was struggling with some heavy shit and she let it get the best of her sometimes but that happens when you are a kid.I liked how this book focused on a variety of hard-hitting issues that can often be brushed over or ignored. The reality of living in poverty is something that millions of Americans, and people around the world, deal with on a daily basis, and while it isn't pretty, it is important to shine light on and discuss.Examples: the fact that Bri's mom was a recovering addict. The fact of the limits that places on her options to provide for her family. The way Bri, and other black and brown kids, were treated at her school. The lifestyle Bri's aunt lives and how that affects her entire family. Bri's brother's options for a job after college. All of these are difficult issues. I appreciated how much substance Thomas put into this. This was far from a one issue story. This was the whole cake and I was eating every bite!I can see why this format may not sit well with everyone. It punches the whole way through but it is an exceptionally told story. Thomas is a true wordsmith. Her writing leaps off the page with realness...is that a word? Realness? You know what I'm saying. As you can tell, I loved this. I want everyone to read it and seriously, I am on the EDGE of my seat until Angie Thomas puts out another book. I am really hoping for another story set in Garden Heights!!!", "Going to keep this review short because everyone and their rap-loving aunt is going to read and review this book. And, cutting right to the chase, because everyone wants to know how On the Come Up measures up to The Hate U Give, so let me be straight: They're different books. THUG is about a girl, a victim, being shuffled along by something much bigger than her - a socio-political movement hundreds of years in the making. Starr Carter is a quiet girl, a good girl, who tries to keep to herself and waits until pretty late in the game to find her voice. That's not Bri. She's anything but quiet. This is her story. Action is driven, not by exterior forces, but by the choices she makes. On the Come Up is an intimate, interpersonal, tight narrative focused on one girl and the consequences of her actions in pursuit of her dream. Bri is flawed, driven, relatable. Her story is inner-city life, hip-hop, self-discovery and self-image rolled into one. THUG is about external conflict. OTCU is about internal conflict. They're different books, but they're both written by a gifted author who boldly explores themes of systemic racism, racial inequality, social injustice, and gang violence and who excels at crafting authentic voice and believable characters. \nMilez glares at me as he raps. Something about how much money he has, how many girls like him, his clothes, his jewelry, the ganster life he's living. Repetitive. Stale. Prewritten. I gotta go for the kill. Here I am, going at him as if I don't have any manners. Manners. A lot of words rhyme with that if I deliver them right. Cameras. Rappers. Pamper. Hammer - MC Hammer. Vanilla Ice. Hip-hop heads consider them pop stars, not real rappers. I can compare him to them. I gotta get my signature line in there - you can only spell \"brilliant\" with Bri. Aunt Pooh once pointed that out right before teasing me about being such a perfectionist. [. . .]Milez lowers the mic. There are a couple of cheers. Supreme claps, yet his face is hard. \"Okay, I see you, Milez!\" Hype says. \"Bri, you better bring the heat!\" The instrumental starts up again. Aunt Pooh said I only get one chance to let everybody and their momma know who I am. So I take it.\n", " This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can take being described as somebody you\u2019re not.\u201d \ud83c\udf1f If Angie Thomas taught me something is that I should use my voice if I have one and I am going to do exactly that. If you think you will be offended by this review or by this not being my favorite book of the year then don\u2019t continue this review!\ud83c\udf1f A thing I have noticed lately is that it is always a bit harder to view diverse books. For me personally I am going to be fair to a book regardless of who wrote it and just because a book is diverse does not make it good.\ud83c\udf1f I loved THUG and I got both an E-book and a hardcover of that book, so you bet I was excited for this. Unfortunately it did not live to the hype for me! I know writing a second book can be harder than the first one specially when it gets the recognition that Angie\u2019s debut got (A 100 weeks as a NYT Bestseller and most as #1, that\u2019s just crazy awesome).\ud83c\udf1f I felt that the writing in this one was mediocre, I did not have that feeling of wanting to read the book non-stop. I am also starting to get annoyed by the HP references in many YA books. I used to enjoy them but now they are kind of a bookish pet peeve for me in writing. I know many authors were affected by that series but I think of them as a shortcut to being relatable which annoys me.\ud83c\udf1f I am not the biggest fan of Hip-Hop so I knew I won\u2019t relate as other readers. That being said I expected it to be more enjoyable. I did not know where the story was going. I felt like it is a milder version of THUG \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af .\ud83c\udf1f I also did not have that connection to the characters as I did in THUG. There was no emotions on my part while reading this. I was annoyed by Bri\u2019s actions. I like when YA characters act their ages and are stupid and do things wrong. But Bri\u2019s insisting on being an outlaw was bothersome.\ud83c\udf1f Summary: I ma have had higher expectation from the book which resulted in my being disappointed. The book was not bad but was no where as good as THUG for me personally. The characters, writing and plot were just too meh for my taste.

So please, respect my opinion. It's against no one, but if you have a different opinion than mine, or you totally disagree with my thoughts, feel free to say your opinion. I will respect it, no matter what.When I found out about this book, I think it was a couple of months ago or something like that. Obviously, I wanted to read this one too after I loved \"The Hate U Give\". I was wondering what new story Angie will give us this time. I didn't want to know anything about this book, so I just got blind on it, knowing that the chance to not like it was almost inexistent.The way she puts on the paper problems like racism, drugs, poverty, police brutality against black people, and other things like this, is outstanding. She gets us to understand why black people are doing some things, how they think, why they react in the way they do it to the most atrocities against them. In this masterpiece, she shows us that black people have feelings too, even if they are drug dealers, rap artists or gang members. They are humans with feelings, with dreams, with expectations, just like the rest of us. True, they may have more \"balls\" than the rest of us, sometimes, but this doesn't mean they have to be put in the corner just because their skin color is not white.This is a brilliant insight into their lives, their minds, and their hearts. They can cry and love and hope, just like the rest of us. And you know what? We also can be drug dealers, gang members and what other bad things we put them on the corner for, just like them. Sometimes even with more \"talent\" than them. But you know what we can't really do like them? We can't really stick to our family like them. Because black people, no matter what, they stick and support their families, exactly how Angie shows us in her book. We can say about us, white people, the same thing? Yes, there are white people like this too, a lot of them, but the big majority can easily leave their family behind for various reasons. And about this, we, white people that can so easily judge black ones, and put them in the corner even for the thing that they speak their mind, I think we have some things to learn from them. The only thing that separates us, is just the skin color. This is all! And Angie Thomas shows this to us in one of the most beautiful and brilliant ways. I am waiting for her next book, the way I am waiting to have my next breath when I am underwater.", "\n\nInstagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo apparently giving supporting details about your arguments = spoilers. I thought I was pretty vague, apart from mentioning a few potentially triggering situations, but just in case: I talk about the book in this review of the book(!), please consider yourself warned. I've been looking forward to ON THE COME UP ever since I heard that Angie Thomas was writing a new book. THE HATE U GIVE was one of those life-changing books for me, in that it was a pitch-perfect book that came out at a time when the subject material was relevant and necessary, and delivered an emotionally-charged story about institutionalized racism, as well as the importance of movements like Black Lives Matter that shine a much-needed spotlight on racial injustice.ON THE COME UP is a similar story in that it also features a girl in Garden Heights who comes from a low-income family and deals with gang violence and gang activity on a day-to-day basis. Bri's mother is a recovering drug addict and her aunt is in the local gang, the Garden Disciples. Her father was a famous up-and-coming rapper who was murdered. People make assumptions about her just because of the color of her skin and where she comes from, and a racially-targeted bag search that ends in violence inspires Bri to write a rap song that ends up going viral.I really wanted to like this book, but it didn't have the same strength in writing that THE HATE U GIVE had. Starr was a compelling protagonist and it was a really emotional read. ON THE COME UP was emotionally distant, by comparison, and Bri was such an awful heroine. She made one terrible choice after another and treated her friends and family like garbage. I hated the way she talked to her mother, and how she called her mother by her first name with such a lack of respect. I hated the way she treated her friend, and how she made a move on her taken friend who was in a relationship. She also wrote a song with very vivid references to gang activity, which is fine, but then she tried to deny that that wasn't what the song was about when she was called on it. Um, what?Here's the thing, ON THE COME UP was trying to tackle some weighty issues just like THE HATE U GIVE did. This book was about the hypocrisy of white people when it comes to guns (OK when white people have them, thuggish and scary when black people have them), cultural appropriation (white people listening to and consuming rap but not wanting to think about the deeper issues and sociocultural suffering and struggles endemic to the black community due to oppression and injustice), and, of course, institutionalized racism leading to the disenfranchisement, abuse, and even murders of black people over infractions that white people would get minor consequences for.The issue with Bri and her school was not resolved in a satisfactory way. They gave her mother a job, sure, but that felt more like they were trying to buy the family's silence and not a moral turnaround. Bri didn't really advance as a character. She ran around doing and saying whatever she wanted and didn't want to take ownership for her actions or the consequences of her actions. At the end of the book, she's basically rewarded for acting like a total shit because of her raps, and the other problematic aspects of her behavior - getting involved in gang wars, siccing her aunt on a rival gang member despite knowing it could end up in murder, failing in school and treating her tests like they're unimportant, ghosting her friends and/or snapping in their faces, and bitching at her mom - are all basically ignored, because oh, she belatedly became part of a movement and then capitalized on it for financial gain and fame, isn't she a good person? Lmao, her friends basically did all the work getting that movement started, and in the beginning she treated them like trash for it. What in the ever-loving heck? Am I supposed to root for this girl? I mean, I get the fear of wanting to get involved against the same authority figures that oppress you and mistreat you, but letting her friends take the fall for her and then jumping on their shit was totally disgusting and I hated her for it. The writing in this book was a real step-down from THE HATE U GIVE, and seemed unpolished and clunky in comparison. Starr was such a great character, and I loved her so much. Bri was a brat, and the best moment in this book was when her mother gives her a real dressing down over her behavior. #TeamJayHonestly, Jay(da) was the star of this book. I loved Bri's mom. She had so much to deal with, and some of her quotes in this book about racism and police brutality and inequality really reminded me of Starr. I almost wish that this was an adult book about parenting and that Jay(da) had been the heroine, because I was much more interested in hearing about her story than Bri's. Yes, the raps were great and had good flow, and I enjoyed them, but I hated that Bri wrote them because I hated Bri. Jay had to deal with lingering biases over her drug use (including her own daughter), despite being eight years sober. She's in college trying to better her education so she can get a good job, while taking care of two kids and dealing with her deceased husband's younger sister, who's a leader in a gang. The most emotional parts in this book all involved her, especially when she goes to Bri's school to speak up about the racist treatment of her ungrateful shit of a daughter. That packed a punch.Huge disappointment. I was wondering why more of my friends hadn't reviewed this book already and I'm guessing maybe they either didn't like it and didn't want to say so, or they were leery about reading the follow-up book from a successful debut author without reading advance reviews. Well, I didn't like this book and I'm flummoxed at the people saying that this was better than THUG. It really wasn't. If anything, this reads like a debut novel, because of how unsteady it is on its own two legs.I'm so bummed that I can't say great things about ON THE COME UP. :/2 stars", "I\u2019m going to be bold about this and say that I loved this more than THUG. Angie Thomas had a hard act to follow, but this was spot on in every possible way. ", "\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never silence me and you\u2019ll never kill my dream. Just recognize when you say brilliant that you\u2019re also saying Bri.\u201d\nOH, this was absolutely 100% amazing and Angie Talent is WAY too talented for me to handle. Obviously, I literally adored \n\u201cThere's only so much you can take being described as somebody you're not.\u201d \nEasily my favourite part of this book was Bri's character. Bri is the kind of character I've been wanting and needing in YA for so long. She feels so genuinely teen and she makes a lot of mistakes that stem from inexperience and her young age but that is what I loved about it. Bri can be brash, harsh, rude, and act without thinking (so many times) but I felt a bit of myself in her recklessness and identified with her teenage angst. I really love that Angie Thomas decided to write a character that really fucks up, and that is really outspoken, it's refreshing. But it's not just her flaws that made me love her - Bri has so many strengths too! she has a heart of gold, is trying to do her best, and loves her friends and family with so much of her heart. She's ambitious and cool, and funny - and damn, I loved the hell outta that girl! Plot wise, this was a lot more fun than The Hate U Give. It still has a lot of the hallmarks of that book though. It deals with racism and growing up as a black teenager in America. It has strong family dynamics, and friendship focus. The focus on family, especially, was a highlight. Angie Thomas knows how to drill down into the core of a family and examine what makes each one tick, and I love the portrayal of the family in this book. This book also just had so much love and heart in it - you could tell. You could tell Thomas loves rap music and hip-hop, she loved her main character, and she loved writing this book. I think that passion and care really leaked onto the pages and it made me care. This book is about music and family but you don't need to care about music to be invested - it just seems to grab you and in a minute you realise you're a hundred pages deep and so invested in the story and the characters. I love that in books. \n\u201cAll these folks I've never met became gods over my life. Now I gotta take the power back.\u201d\nOverall, I think this was just as good as THUG - just in a different way. It's kind of sad to me people seem to have slept on this book a bit because it's great and has so many themes people can connect with. It's a YA book that isn't afraid to shove a loud and bossy main character into the forefront - and to celebrate them for those traits. It's a book that blends rap and friends and family, that has the hallmark YA tropes like first love and family issues, while also exploring race issues in America in a genuine way that only an #ownvoices author can. I also loved the audiobook for this a lot - the narrator sings the raps and its PERFECT. ", "Well we all knew the Queen of YA would gift us with another incredible story...so brb, just feeling so many things about this one. I also really love Angie Thomas' style, her voice, and her passion and love that you can absolutely feel in every single page of the book. This one is about rapping and being poor and figuring out who you are, no matter what the world is saying or where it's telling you that you fit. It's not quite as dark as The Hate U Give, but that doesn't make it any less powerful or needed! (I maybe liked THUG more, but I also don't want to compare them, because they're different!) \u27b8 So first things first: rapping.Bri's #1 dream is to be a rapper and she's pretty downright good at it. But she writes a song that gets misconstrued and her career sort of snowballs from there. Now, I know zero about rapping ok. So I wont' pretend to have an opinion on this except (1) there are some powerful lyrics going on in this book, (2) I cannot frikkin' wait for the movie version, and (3) I believe Angie Thomas herself is a rapper, so I can imagine a lot of talent and love went into this part of the story! There were a lot of volleying opinions about Bri's rap too: like her family was not happy about her talking about guns and defiance, but Bri was writing about what the world expected her to be anyway.\u27b8Also can we just appreciate Bri for a second???She's amazing. She is a geek (and SO TIRED of how most people in her neighbourhood have zero clue what any of her geek culture references are) and she's so protective and loving towards her little messed up family. I mean they're massively struggling. They're super poor (to the point of sometimes there is no food), her mum is struggling to get a job because of her past addictions, Bri's dad got murdered when she was little and she got abandoned by her mum who fell to drugs and took a long time to rebuild. But their family is EPIC and tight and the banter and dialogue is my favourite thing. A+++ to how Angie Thomas always gives us such epic families!! Trey is such a big brother sweetheart with a tough side, and her mum is badass as well as being vulnerable.And Bri has a whip-sharp temper and she's so passionate. I loved this about her. But of course this lands her with the labels of being \"that sassy black girl\" (which she is furious to be stereotyped) and being aggressive...just for having an opinion. She's definitely not perfect of course. She's 16 and she doesn't know everything and she makes crappy decisions. I really felt for her afjdslkafd. And omg I love her friend squad!! So we have Bri and her two besties, Sonny (who is gay and an artist) and Malik (who loves film and Bri has a Secret Crush on him but that goes...badly lolol). They've been friends since forever, but they're all changing, and I just loved their dynamics. They joke and they fight and I just wanted them to be good !!! friendships get me every time in books. The BEST.\u27b8 Also the romance was so smol but so cute.It was definitely a tiny sidedish of the story, but I loved it! And it was a budding romance, so it was cute to see it unfurl amongst the other messes happening for Bri.\u27b8 The themes are so so good for this too.I mean, but of course. This book has arrived to talk, and it's talking loudly. It unpacks racial profiling and prejudice, it talks about what it really means to be poor, and it talks about defining yourself even though others try to do it for you. There's also a lot of talk about consequences here...ahhh, they often hurt. I'm not American or black, so I definitely want to step back and not pretend to know everything about how Bri felt with living in the hood and struggling with hating stereotypes but wanting to be herself and speak out. I just wanted to quietly read this and absorb it from an #ownvoices author.\u27b8 Also the writing?! YES.Dude, I laughed out loud. And I felt all twisted up with anxious nerves. Like, again it wasn't as dark as THUG, so I didn't feel wrecked reading it. But the emotion was palpable. And some of the lines just totally cracked me up. Also it felt like the 450 page book just swished by so fast?! The book is addictive and Bri's voice is so easy to love.Obviously this is one you don't want to miss!! I loved it so much and seriously cannot wait for Thomas' next book announcement. (pls be soon...)", "Angie Thomas has such a way of incorporating social justice (and injustice) into her stories that is both moving and eye opening. This book focused on so many things - racism, drugs, poverty, family issues, being true to yourself and more & it dealt with each one undeniably well. I was worried going into this book that it wouldn't live up to The Hate You Give for me. While THUG is still my favorite, Bri and her family and friends definitely captured me. I was fully invested in the characters and their story. Thomas' ability to fully capture the community and people around her main characters is one of the things I love most about her books. One recommendation I would make if this one is on your TBR - consider the audiobook! There are lots of infused rap lyrics and I highly doubt I did all the rap battles justice. It would have been awesome to hear them aloud. I have no doubt it would make for an even more amazing reading experience.", "3.5 stars!\n\nAngie Thomas' debut novel 'The Hate You Give' blew me away. I hate to compare it to this, because they are totally different stories, but I couldn't help myself. For me, this was good, but not near as good as THUG. Angie Thomas is an amazing writer and there was lots I loved about this book, but there were also things that missed the mark a bit. Bri is a teenager and an aspiring rapper. She wants to make it big not only because she is talented and wants to be famous etc, but because she wants to help support her family. Times are hard, and now that her mom lost her job they're even harder. Bri feels a lot of pressure. Most of it she puts on herself, but her life is far from easy. I could sympathize with Bri. Growing up in poverty is not easy and I understood why she made a lot of the choices she made. While on the come up, Bri has a lot of hard choices to make. There are people that want to take advantage, to use her to get ahead themselves. She finds out really fast who she can trust and that people will see you the way you portray. This was a tough lesson for her to learn. \n\u201cThere's only so much you can take being described as somebody you're not.\u201d\nThere were so many great moments in this book and characters I loved. Bri's mom was probably my favorite. Jay had been through so much and overcame so much. She was genuine and only wanted what was best for her kids. I also loved Bri's brother and friends. This is one of those books, like THUG, I could see on the big screen. Overall, I did enjoy this one. There was no huge thing that was wrong with it, it just didn't hit me like THUG did. It was still a worthy read and I'm glad I read it. It had emotion, humor, and a good message. Also, the audio book was excellent. Bahni Turpin (the narrator) killed it. If you're going to read it, I would highly recommend listening!", "\nAngie is the best! I loved this book.\n", "Damn, I loved this book!  The Hate U Give was one of my favorite reads in 2017 and it looks like  On the Come Up is going to make my 2019 list. Angie Thomas absolutely nails \"voice\" and \"characterization \" in her storytelling and in 16 year old Brianna, an aspiring rapper, she creates a protagonist that I was cheering for from page one.  That's what we call our goal, the come up. It's when we finally make it with this rap stuff. I'm talking get-out-of-the-Garden-and-have-enough-money-to-never-worry-again make it. This will most likely not be a shock to anyone but I don't know a lot about the hip hop industry and the only time I really listen to rap music is when one of my high school students plays it during basketball in the gymnasium. But Angie Thomas was a teenage rapper at one time and the way this story unfolds certainly makes me wonder how much of the story is her actual story. So many characters remind Brianna to be true to herself, but I liked how Thomas really flicks the microscope on the industry, its artists, and social media.Another clear winner for me is that there are so many types of relationships in this story. Brianna and her mother, Jayda. The tight sibling relationship between Brianna and her big brother, Trey. Probably one of my all time favorite characters was Brianna's Aunt Pooh( Katricia), a member of a local gang who has always been Brianna's chief cheerleader when it comes to her music. So many characters and even though Brianna is the main lead, as a readerI felt really get to know so much about each of them and a sense of their importance in Brianna's life. There are just so many incredible scenes of dialogue between Brianna and the other characters. Without spoiling too much, there is this incredible scene between Jayda and her sister Katricia that still gets me a bit misty eyed.Like  The Hate U Give Thomas also looks at racism in our society. Brianna's rap aspirations come head to head as she is dealing with something that happens at her school and in her home. When her fellow students use one of her songs in their peaceful protest, Brianna finds her identity struggles to now be interwoven with the music she writes.  But I don't want people thinking that this book is just heavy because there is plenty of laughter to be found too. Especially between Brianna and her pals Malik and Sonny. Tweety Bird? The love of my life. Big Bird? I don't trust that ho. Plus, have you seen his nest? He probably hides bodies in it.  But I guess Curtis is cute in the same way rodents are weirdly adorable. You know how you'll see a baby mouse and will be like \"Aw, cute! Until that bitch is raiding your cabinet, eating the Halloween candy you hid from your little sisters.  So I definitely loved this book. I certainly would recommend it to others. Even if you weren't a fan of The Hate U Give, give it a shot. Lastly, I would love to hear what other readers have thought and would appreciate a good discussion.", "Angie Thomas didn't just live up to the expectations I had after reading and loving The Hate U Give, she went to an entirely new level with On The Come Up. As a school librarian and reviewer of a great deal of young adult literature, I can tend to feel a bit of \u201dbeen there, read that\" with many stories. This isn't a knock on YA, it's simply a result of being an adult reading a lot of YA. However, with On the Come Up, Angie Thomas brings a fresh and vital story to the genre, and also one of the most amazing voices I have ever read in any level of literature.This story is about the systemic racism (and poverty) that prevails in America and the realities of so many Black youths in our country. It hits rap culture, racism, police brutality, gangs, drugs, and more. Thomas doesn't hold back in her scathing criticism of the current state of things (and many of the people) in fictional Garden Heights and the surrounding wealthier neighborhoods, projecting to the cities of the US as a whole. What impresses me the most is her ability to build empathy in readers for characters who so often are written as villains - she digs deep into why drug dealers are dealing, why addicts are using, why parents abandon their children, why families are living in poverty, why gang members are in gangs, why some rappers are using the lyrics that they do, and more. The why is honestly the most important part of all of those issues when reading through a critical lens with the knowledge of the systemic racism that has always plagued the US.Reading this book at the same time as The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration and immediately following Heavy: An American Memoir gave me such important context to bring to the story. I also recently read Rap Dad: A Story of Family and the Subculture That Shaped a Generation which helped me immensely as a reader who listens to NO rap music, but holds a very healthy respect for the genre as a cultural standard.On the subject of issue book vs. non-issue book - this is a capital-I-issue book. And it's the gold standard of such. If you get a chance to listen to Angie Thomas' interview on the podcast \"It's Been a Minute\", please do. It added such a rich layer to my reading of this book because it made me understand completely who this book is for and the motivation for writing it. Thomas makes it blatantly clear this book is for the Black kids in neighborhoods like the one she grew up in in Jackson, Mississippi and how closely the neighborhood of Garden Heights is based on this same neighborhood. Sure, this book is a window for suburban white kids and middle-aged white women like me, but that's not who she's really doing the work for.In addition, her words in the interview about the attempts to ban The Hate U Give are spot on. When she describes how an 8-year-old wrote to her after reading it and said his mom gave it to him and he loved it, she talks about how some white moms are worried about their 13-year-olds reading it. She lays it out that if a Black mom feels that her young son needs this story because of his reality, then white moms shielding their teens from even reading about it is absolute privilege. That hit me so hard. The attempts to keep OTCU out of hands of teens will surely come, and I guarantee Bri would have words to throw back about it. This is the life and circumstances that teens are living, and the very least white parents and teachers/librarians can do is encourage more privileged kids to read it, rather than shield them from it. As for the kids that Thomas is writing for, let's all do our part to get this book to them. In any way possible.If you are a white adult who claims to \"not read YA because I'm an adult\", I challenge you to READ THIS BOOK. Open your mind. Listen. Learn. You don't need to review it, but know that Thomas is speaking her truth, as well as the truth of a vast number of people in our country. Honor them and hear the story.", "Uh oh. After loving The Hate U Give, I was very excited to read Angie Thomas\u2019s next book, On the Come Up. I\u2019m bummed, however, to say it was just an ok read for me. Sixteen-year old Bri Jackson lives in the Gardens but attends a prep school in another, better neighborhood. Her mom is 8 years clean, following the death of Bri\u2019s dad, and is now going back to school to become a social worker. Her brother, Trey, recently graduated college and is living at home trying to help his family out - Bills and unsteady jobs threaten their stability. Her father, a local rapper, Lawless, died years ago. Bri also wants to be a rapper, often dubbed as \u201cLil Law\u201d by others, but has difficultly breaking out of the shadow of her father, who was well-known in their neighborhood. Recognizing first and foremost this is a YA book and therefore I\u2019m not the intended primary target audience, I have to say it felt very YA. The dialogue often seemed cheesy. For a book that was not the same as T.H.U.G, there appeared to be numerous similarities: a bad neighborhood (the same one in fact), an older brother the MC seems to idolize, and a stance against social injustice, though more subtle in On the Come Up. The ending also felt abrupt, possibly leaving the door open for future installments? This wasn\u2019t a bad book and it has many great reviews - It just wasn\u2019t for me. Maybe my expectations were too high after T.H.U.G, but I wasn\u2019t wowed by On the Come Up.", "\nWhy isn't this in my hands yet? *sob*\n", "\nANOTHER NOVEL FROM THE AUTHOR BEHIND THE PHENOMENAL THE HATE U GIVE?SIGN ME UP.\n", "So good! I had Bri's songs stuck in my head the whole time I was reading this. Loved how this unpacks the \"angry Black woman\" stereotype through Bri's school experience and music. Audiobook review: Narration is great. It's the same voice actor who did Children of Blood and Bone for reference. There is some yelling, which is always a pet peeve of mine for volume control, but I'd still recommend the audio!tw: racial profiling, gangs/gang wars, drug dealing, addiction (character is recovered, but there are references and flashbacks to when she was using), death of parent (in the past but referred to often)", "This was really good! I wasn't as big of a fan of this book as I was of The Hate U Give, but this book contains the same amazing writing and calling people out on their white privilege. The main character Bri lives in the same neighborhood as Starr from The Hate U Give (which is pretty cool). Bri wants to become the next best rap artist, and this is a story of her rise to fame, but it's also a drama about her family and all the hardships they have to deal with, mostly due to the color of their skin. This book was very eye-opening to me in the same way The Hate U Give was, it pointed out some aspects of white privilege that I once again had never considered. Angie Thomas's writing is so freaking amazing. That is something that is obvious to me, even though I didn't absolutely love this story the way I did with her first book, there's no question in my mind that Angie Thomas is one of the best writers out there today. Her sense of humor is amazing and there were several moments in this book where I laughed out loud. I wasn't a huge fan of the rapping portion of this story. I'm actually a pretty big fan of some rap and R&B music, but I'm not a huge fan of freestyle rap. However, it was kind of fun reading Bri's verses that she would come up with, she is pretty clever. Overall, I really enjoyed this one and I will read everything Angie Thomas writes ever. This was one of my BOTM picks for February and this is the 3rd and final book I finished during the Contemporaryathon. :)", "#mystrangereading On The Come Up by Angie Thomas \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fTHIS BOOK. If you read THUG, then you understand how masterful Thomas is in her ability to write a beautiful story centered around characters that are so three dimensional that the reader can be truly traumatized. Many times while reading this book, I could picture Bri as one of my own students and felt my heart jolt and blood pressure rise as she made stupid choices or walked into tough situations. As a THUG reader, I walked into this book assuming that 'the boy that was shot' was Khalil, but I think there is a beauty in the fact that Thomas never actually says his name--reminding the reader that shootings like Khalil's happen far too often in places like Garden Heights and sadly the names of the victims are quickly forgotten. Bri is a kick-ass rapper from Garden Heights and knows that her verses will be the thing that gets her out of there. However, fame, popularity, race and prejudice are all hurdles she must face in order to make a real future for herself. This story will leave you angry at how much prejudice and racism is so rampant and completely ignored. This story will leave you heartbroken for the tough choices and lack of options that exist for so many people from neighborhoods like Garden Heights. This story will make you scream at Bri's teenage idiocy, and how many people want to take advantage of a kid who is trying to find their own path. But mostly, this story will keep you up late at night reading to find out what will happen next.Beautiful. Wonderful. Gorgeous writing. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "\nI devoured this book in a single day - that's how good it was! Angie Thomas has a magnificent way of writing characters you truly connect with and i was so invested in how things turned out for Bri. \n", "I started reading On the Come Up on 3/16/2019 and finished it on 3/28/2019 at 12:30am. This book is an excellent read! I love that it takes place in the same neighborhood as the author\u2019s first book and the bits and pieces of the first book were mentioned on here. I can\u2019t recall if Bri\u2019s dad was mentioned in The Hate U Give since I read it awhile ago. The characters are likeable. I like Bri\u2019s older brother, Trey. He\u2019s such a caring brother and a good son. I like Bri\u2019s friends Sonny and Malik, especially Sonny and his out of this world specific examples and cute love life. I like Bri\u2019s mom, more on how she protects her kids. I\u2019m disappointed in her when she retreats into her room like a turtle hiding inside its shell. Despite their hardship, Bri\u2019s mom wants no free handouts from her in-laws and wants her daughter to experience her teen life without worrying about bills. I like learning little life lessons from reading books and books by this author definitely has them.This book is told in the first person point of view following Brianna (Bri) Jackson, 16 as she attends an ACT prep class with her best buddies Malik and Sonny. Bri isn\u2019t worry about the ACT, instead she\u2019s waiting for a phone call. She wants to take part in the Ring, a place to give wannabe rappers a chance to be heard through a battle. Bri\u2019s father was a rapper, known as the underground King until he was killed and Bri\u2019s mother is a recovering drug addict. Bri\u2019s older brother Trey, 22 graduated with honors but have a hard time finding a job. Their home life is hard especially when Bri\u2019s mom loses her job. All Bri wants is to make it big as a rapper to improve her family\u2019s life, but with what little she has to rely on, there will for sure be challenges. This book is divided into 3 parts.On the Come Up is very well written and hard to put down. I enjoy reading this book almost as much as the author\u2019s debut, though, her debut makes me laugh more. That competitiveness between Bri\u2019s family on the UNO game and Michael Jackson Wii game is fun to read. I like the bit of romance and flirting though I thought Bri shouldn\u2019t let his hands wander on their first kiss. I like when books are written in the first person point of view because it feels realistic. I like learning how Bri experience discrimination and racism being an African American, either going to a store or attending a school that has fewer students of the same race. It reminds me of why I often stay away from entering those stores with few customers because I don\u2019t enjoy the sales associates\u2019 eyes on my back either. Another winner from Angie Thomas and I highly recommend everyone to read this book!Pro: fast paced, page turner, couldn\u2019t put down, rap music, poetry, family, friendship, diversity, humorCon: noneI rate it 5 stars!***Disclaimer: I borrowed this book from my local library and my opinions are honest.xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details", "Urbandictionary.com shows the definition for \non the come up\n as \n\u201csomething that's not quite happening yet, but on the verge of blowing up or making some serious noise.\u201d\n This phrase definitely applies to Angie Thomas' newest heroine Bri in her goal of becoming a rapper... and in her life in general. If only she didn't have so much weighing her down. Hip-hop is where she finds her solace. Creating deeply felt lyrics allows her to cope and communicate freely all at once. It gives her a voice when she feels invisible and misunderstood, and she is so very good at it. But when her lyrics get taken out of context and used in a way that \u201cthe majority\u201d expects of her zip code, she must decide which direction she will go at this forced crossroad. Will she claim the role of villain that has already been laid out for her or will she choose to define herself? Located in the familiar neighborhood of Garden Heights, On the Come Up is set one year after the events that occurred in The Hate U Give. The murder, legal outcome and rioting from The Hate U Give are revisited in reference as a way of explaining how the neighborhood has been impacted, but this is not a sequel. It is a standalone novel and can be enjoyed as such. And enjoy it you will! Freestyle rap battle scenes meet themes related to identity and overcoming. Full of amazing characters, an engaging story, and a spotlight on racial inequality, On the Come Up is an excellent read. Check it out.Warning: Reading this book will cause an immediate craving for the message-filled, poetry-laden art that is hip-hop. Proceed with excitement!My favorite quote:\"Who are you? Of the millions and billions of people in the world you're the only person who can answer that. Not people online or at your school. I can't even answer that. I can say who I think you are and I think you're brilliant, talented, courageous, beautiful, you're my miracle. But you're the only one who can say who you are with authority. So, who are you?2/7/19:Yes!!! Loved it! RTC", "Buddy read with NkishaOH MY GOD I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD NEVER END!!! Felt like crying when I saw there was an epilogue because I just needed it to be over already!!!!!! This was overwrought, insanely drawn out, laden with stereotypical characters rather than characters that felt visceral in any shape or form. The writing was sub-par, the plot was borderline nonexistent, the side characters were bland and interchangeable and I couldn't cope with the stupidity that the MC Bri frequently displayed. She was such an irritating character with how she basically disrespected her mother and brother at every opportunity which could have made for an interesting person to read about... But frankly she just annoyed me too much to even value those attributes of hers and consider her an interestingly flawed lead character. Such a disappointment after the powerful character that was Starr in THUG and especially when this book had such an important message about the disgusting racial discrimination shown to black and latinx teenagers by authority figures. But sadly that message got lost amidst the less than mediocre writing. Nope. This wasn't at all to my liking. The one positive aspect was the inclusion of Bri's raps. Typically I hate when books include lyrics of songs, poetry etc etc that are supposedly written by one or more of the characters in the book but this was an example of when the rap lyrics were truly much more powerful than anything else said in this book. I was firmly able to believe in Bri's talents and really wished that the emotion of these raps was more evident in the rest of the novel. So I'll give an extra star for them and say two stars overall....an hour and a half later.... nope. I'm bitter. One star it is OOOPS XD", "After the phenomenal success of The Hate U Give, it would be easy to sit back and compare the two novels. However, On the Come Up is a utterly brilliant book in its own right and very much stands on its own two feet. It was superb.I adore the way Angie Thomas\u2019 writing pulls you in from the get go. Her ability to write complexly, whilst at the same time, making reading the raw and heart pounding stories she creates easy, is awe inspiring. The characters and voices in On the Come Up, are full of so much warmth and depth, you can\u2019t help but want to hold onto their story for as long as possible. They\u2019re funny, powerful, passionate, vulnerable, strong, flawed and real. I loved them. The setting was wonderful, as was the connection and mentions of the events of The Hate U Give, proving how big of a lasting impact shootings have on a community. I equally loved the addition of Brianna\u2019s lyrics, which were full of depth and talent.The marvel references were everything and I loved the little but definitely not unnoticed nod to Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.In short, Bri\u2019s story is one I will remember for a long time to come."], "genre": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Fiction"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/56364068-on-the-come-up", "avg_ratings": "4.30", "ShelvedNumber": "2010"}

Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at The Wall Street Journal, got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the Journal were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1556268702l/37976541.jpg", "title": "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup", "authors": "John Carreyrou", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood", "reviews": ["I don\u2019t read a lot of page turners. I often find myself unable to put a book down\u2014but they\u2019re not the kinds of books that would keep most people glued to their chairs. Still, I recently found myself reading a book so compelling that I couldn\u2019t turn away.Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou details the rise and fall of Theranos. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the Theranos story, here\u2019s the short version: the company promised to quickly give you a complete picture of your health using only a small amount of blood. Elizabeth Holmes founded it when she was just 19 years old, and both she and Theranos quickly became the darlings of Silicon Valley. She gave massively popular TED talks and appeared on the covers of Forbes and Fortune.By 2013, Theranos was valued at nearly $10 billion and even partnered with Walgreens to put their blood tests in stores around the country. The problem? Their technology never worked. It never came close to working. But Holmes was so good at selling her vision that she wasn\u2019t stopped until after real patients were using the company\u2019s \u201ctests\u201d to make decisions about their health. She and her former business partner are now facing potential jail time on fraud charges, and Theranos officially shut down in August.The public didn\u2019t know about Theranos\u2019 deception until Carreyrou broke the story as a reporter at the Wall Street Journal. Because he was so integral to the company\u2019s demise, Bad Blood offers a remarkable inside look.Some of the details he shares are\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014insane. Holmes would invite prospective investors to the lab, so they could get their blood tested on a Theranos machine. The device had been programmed to show a really slow progress bar instead of an error message. When results didn\u2019t come back right away, Holmes sent the investors home and promised to follow up with results.As soon as they left, an employee would remove the blood sample from the device and transfer it to a commercial blood analyzer. Her investors got their blood tested by the same machines available in any lab in the country, and they had no idea.There\u2019s a lot Silicon Valley can learn from the Theranos mess. To start, a company needs relevant experts on its board of directors. The Theranos board had some heavy hitters\u2014including several former Cabinet secretaries and senators\u2014but for most of the company\u2019s existence, none of them had any expertise in diagnostics. If they had, they might have noticed the red flags a lot sooner.Health technology requires a different approach than other kinds of technology, because human lives are on the line. Carreyrou writes a lot about how Holmes idolized Steve Jobs and his unwillingness to compromise on his vision. That approach is okay for consumer electronics\u2014if a new phone doesn\u2019t work as promised, no one gets hurt\u2014but it\u2019s irresponsible for a health company. Holmes pushed a vision of what Theranos could be, not what it actually was, and people suffered as a result.Bad Blood is also a cautionary tale about the virtues of celebrity. On the surface, Holmes was everything Silicon Valley loves in a CEO: charismatic and convincing with a memorable personal story made for magazine profiles. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that on its own. A rock star CEO can be a huge boon for a startup. But you can\u2019t let fame become the most important thing.Theranos is the worst-case scenario of what happens when a CEO prioritizes personal legacy above all else\u2014but I hope that people don\u2019t use it as an excuse to write off the next young woman with a big idea. I also don\u2019t want Bad Blood to scare people away from next-gen diagnostics. Theranos went to extraordinary lengths to get around quality standards. The industry is highly regulated, and new diagnostics undergo rigorous testing.Bad Blood tackles some serious ethical questions, but it is ultimately a thriller with a tragic ending. It\u2019s a fun read full of bizarre details that will make you gasp out loud. The story almost feels too ridiculous to be real at points (no wonder Hollywood is already planning to turn it into a movie). I think it\u2019s the perfect book to read by the fire this winter.", "Fascinating accounting of the Theranos scam and I do mean SCAM. Exhaustively reported. I do wish there had been more analysis of how a scam of this magnitude was made possible and enabled. This girl dropped out of college and convinced Henry Kissinger, George Schulz, Rupert Murdoch and a bunch of other famous and/or incredibly talented people to give her money or work with her even though there was no there, there. WHAT? There are so many incredible WTF moments. Just wow. Privilege is a hell of a drug, I guess. ", "\"The resignations infuriated Elizabeth and Sunny. The following day, they summoned the staff for an all-hands meeting in the cafeteria. Copies of The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho had been placed on every chair. Elizabeth told the gathered employees that she was building a religion. If there was anyone not prepared to show complete devotion and unmitigated loyalty to the company they should \u201cget the fuck out.\u201dThe Steve Jobs SyndromeI have covered Silicon Valley as a journalist and author for three decades now. I\u2019m not big on attending conferences, but made a point to go to an awards event at a favorite forum in September 2015. Among the recipients that year was Silicon Valley legend, Andy Grove, getting the lifetime achievement award.Also on the list, getting the \u201cglobal benefactor\u201d award, was someone I had never heard of, Elizabeth Holmes. I had also never heard of her company, Theranos. Though I once worked for a business magazine, I never read any others. And Theranos was in the medical device \u201cspace,\u201d which is pretty different from software and social media.Her presentation was last. Joining her on stage was her Stanford professor and mentor, Channing Robertson. He spoke first. He told this story of Holmes as a kind of prodigy who camped out at the doors of his office and lab until he admitted her as a freshman into his upper division courses in chemical engineering. I would learn later that he considered Holmes a once-in-a-generation genius, comparing her to Newton, Einstein, Mozart, and Leonardo da Vinci. Heavy praise, indeed.Holmes was up next. She wore a black, mock turtleneck that reminded me of Steve Jobs. Her dyed blond hair was up, slightly skewed, that struck me as a bit calculated. She had large, unblinking blue eyes and spoke in a low baritone. By the end of her talk, it struck me that she had essentially said nothing of substance about her product or her company. Instead, it was high-falutin\u2019 claims that reminded me of the rhetoric Steve Jobs used when rolling out a new product, except that he had a real product he was demonstrating each time. I was immediately suspicious of Holmes and Theranos. I had seen too much over the years to take something like this at face value.When I got home, I did a computer search and learned that Holmes had been on the cover of numerous business magazines as the first female tech billionaire. (My wife would always add: \u201con paper.\u201d) In some photos she posed with a tiny vial of blood that was supposed to represent all that would be needed to do numerous tests with the company device.Almost a month later, the first in a series of Wall Street Journal articles about Theranos, by the author of this book, was published. It reported that their technology did not work. (I was to learn later that the author interviewed 60 former Theranos employees for his research). My suspicions were confirmed. I eagerly read every new installment of the WSJ series.But \u201cBad Blood\u201d goes much deeper than those articles. It turns out that Channing Robertson was not the only older man over whom Holmes had a kind of hypnotic power, like the mythical Mata Hari. There was veteran venture capitalist, Donald L. Lucas, whose backing and connections enabled Holmes to keep raising money. Then Dr. J and Wade Miquelon at Walgreens and Safeway CEO Steve Burd, as well as General James Mattis (now Trump\u2019s Secretary of Defense), George Shultz, and Henry Kissinger. All of these men served as enablers, when they were in positions where they could have put a stop to the fraud. Most of these operations had experts who knew the science and tried to warn their superiors, but were ignored. And there\u2019s no doubt that the medical miracles Theranos promised were very appealing to these older men, as well as to so many others who heard her spiel. One of the most important older men was Sunny Balwani, her romantic partner 20 years her senior. He knew nothing about science, but was essentially her primary henchman for bullying dissenters in the company, heading up employee surveillance and doing the dirty work of firing people. He also subbed as CFO after the only one they had was fired for questioning company honesty. Balwani would pull numbers out of his butt and claim they were legitimate revenue projections.Those who weren\u2019t fooled were veteran venture capitalists who had been investing in the medical device space for years. During one of her pitches to these firms, she was asked so many questions she couldn\u2019t answer that she stormed out of the conference room. In a one-on-one encounter with another successful venture capitalist he asked to see her device. Instead, she slapped her notebook shut and said: \u201cif you can\u2019t trust me, I can\u2019t work with you\u201d and slammed the door behind her as she departed.In turns out that in spite of her time at Stanford, Holmes didn\u2019t know much science. She described the process of her device as follows\u2026.\u201cA chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.\u201dThe selling point was no more needles, just a slight lance of a fingertip could provide enough blood to do countless tests. When the author queried Timothy Hamill, from the UCSF Department of Laboratory Science, he told him\u2026\"\u2026.the pitfalls of using blood pricked from a finger. Unlike venous blood drawn from the arm, capillary blood was polluted by fluids from tissues and cells that interfered with tests and made measurements less accurate. \u201cI\u2019d be less surprised if they told us they were time travelers who came back from the twenty-seventh century than if they told us they cracked that nut,\u201d he added.The whole concept was flawed from the beginning. Holmes used non-company technology to try to cover this up. In a PowerPoint presentation she made to investors one slide showed scatter plots purporting to favorably compare test data from Theranos\u2019s proprietary analyzers to data from conventional lab machines. But all the data came from non-Theranos technology. They often used other tech than company technology that could not generate accurate results for patients. Theranos even resorted to using hypodermic needles, instead of the promised fingertip prick. Meanwhile, Holmes continued to expand her Steve Jobs persona. She drank green kale shakes (Jobs was vegan), leased cars with no license plates (as he had), had several bodyguards who referred to her as Eagle1 (Eagle2 was Bulwani) and flew in a Gulfstream Jet. She referred to her device as the i-Pod of Health. And even hired the ad and pr firm that Apple once used, Chiat-Day, even though Theranos could not afford them. And looking back, it appeared that her dropping out of college was part of a script, just the way Jobs and Gates dropped out to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.When she went on the Jim Cramer\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d show to denounce the WSJ, she sounded very Jobs-like when she said: \u201cFirst they think you\u2019re crazy, then they fight you, and then, all of a sudden, you change the world.\u201cNot surprisingly, Theranos kept missing their deadlines. Its contract with Safeway fell through, but Walgreen\u2019s was more important to them. Several stores in Arizona went \u201clive\u201d with testing. Most tests done there were way off, resulting in unnecessary trips to the ER and potential over-treatment. Various doctors and patients published negative reviews on Yelp. This put the company in the realm of reckless endangerment: \u201ca crime consisting of acts that create a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.\u201dThis reality upset many employees who wanted no part of a fraud that would harm people. At company meetings, Holmes would say: \u201cIf anyone here believes you are not working on the best thing humans have ever built, then you should leave.\u201dMany took her up on that, but it was never without controversy. Meanwhile, bulldog Sunny was dispatched to Arizona to intimidate those who had posted negative Yelp reviews. And the company had hired super-lawyer David Boies to threaten suit against anyone who revealed insider info on the company. Just as one example, it cost the Schulz family $400k in legal fees to defend George\u2019s nephew Tyler. Theranos knew Tyler had met with the author because they had a tail on both Tyler and the author.When I finished the book I thought back on that awards ceremony I had attended where I first saw Holmes. I recalled Andy Grove, whose lifetime achievement award represented the original Silicon Valley of sweat equity. Grove lived through the Nazi occupation of his native country of Hungary and escaped after it became Communist. In New York, he worked as a busboy while he learned English and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering from City College of New York. Graduate work took him to the west coast, where he earned a Ph.D from U.C. Berkeley in chemical engineering. He would go on to help found chip maker, Intel, a company that truly changed the world.These days, what I see in Silicon Valley is an increasing obsession with wealth and an absence of ethics, and the spread of the Steve Jobs Syndrome, like some kind of disease. Theranos epitomized all of this. The result is a lack of the honest work that Grove epitomized, in which wealth and notoriety were by-products not goals. The real goal was to do good work, first and foremost. And always tell the truth.=============The beat goes on....https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/...", "Last night when I finished this I just wanted to write a review that was haha repeated like four hundred times. I've gotten some sleep since then and calmed down though. This was really good, like I stayed up until 3 am reading because I didn't want to put it down good. Most I'm just befuddled that this happened at all and at the fact that most of the people implicated in this are just probably never going to face any repercussions. I don't even necessarily mean legal repercussions but like just there seems like there's zero contrition or embarrassment on the part of people like George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, James N. Mattis, or Channing Robertson. Like just their instance until even recently that Theranos has proprietary technology that was novel and that there wasn't merit to anything being said, or the way Mattis was even confirmed as Secretary of Defense not too long ago. I'm just baffled and I think the book shouldn't have said Holmes was solely responsible for the mess that was Theranos when so many people who we're supposed to think as credible couldn't be bothered to do any due diligence. When Schultz's own grandson came to him to tell him that things weren't right at Theranos and he just disregarded him. I honestly couldn't even comprehend how someone could be like that, but I guess what else can you expect from someone involved in something like the Iran-Contra affair. Really good book, would totally recommend, personally could not look away from this god damn train wreck of a situation that was entirely preventable.", "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou is a 2018 Knopf Publishing Group publication. \u2018Super high turnover rate means you\u2019re never bored at work. Also good if you\u2019re an introvert because each shift is short-staffed. Especially if you\u2019re swing or graveyard. You essentially don\u2019t exist to the company.Why be bothered with lab coats and safety goggles? You don\u2019t need to use PPE at all. Who cares if you catch something like HIV or Syphilis?

How to make money at Theranos:1.\tLie to venture capitalists2.\tLie to doctors, patients, FDA, CDC, government. While also committing highly unethical and immoral (and possibly illegal) acts. This is the story of Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 meteoric rise and her swift and spectacular fall from grace-I didn\u2019t closely follow this case in the same way I do some true crime stories, but I did keep up with it enough to get the gist of what had transpired, who some of the players were, and why the company was sued. So, when I saw this book, I knew I wanted to read it. I had to know all the details, the how, when, where, and why because it was just such a bizarre situation. However, after I read this book, I sat back in complete shock. Sometimes, I just could not believe what I was reading!! I also couldn\u2019t believe all the names that popped up in this book!! Before anyone starts pointing fingers at one side of the other, people from all political stripes were misled by the charismatic Holmes. These people are supposed to be the best and the brightest, but frankly, every one of them left me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. For those who many not have kept up with the news stories-Elizabeth Holmes, barely out of her teens, was behind a Silicon Valley startup called Theranos. The company claimed to have invented a device that could take a very small amount a blood, usually from a single finger prick, and perform as many as eight hundred different tests on it, often promising instant results or diagnosis. The demonstrations showed mixed results, so to be sure the results wowed the potential investor, the tests were often rigged. Any unfavorable statistics were simply tossed out or ignored. The device and its potential capabilities were pitched to Safeway, Walgreens, and even the Military. Elizabeth\u2019s magnetic personality was enthralling, and she had a way of convincing people to do what she wanted them to, persuading even the most skeptical to put their faith and trust in her. However, multitudes of her employees found out the hard way, what might happen if they challenged her, or her Svengali -like lover Ramesh \u2018Sunny\u2019 Balwani. Many people were disturbed by the false claims Elizabeth made and were very concerned about the false positive results the blood tests produced on real patients. Employees at the company dropped like flies. Eventually, one employee, Tyler Shultz, grandson of former secretary of state, George Shultz, became a whistleblower, bringing down a nine -billion -dollar operation in the process. This story is utterly chilling, and mind boggling. I marveled at the gullibility of people we entrust our lives to, not only at the base level of health care, but at high levels of the government and the military. I\u2019d have thought some of the people were smarter than that. Apparently not. Look, even someone like me, from Podunk, Texas, would know better than to take a medical claim such as this one at face value. I wouldn\u2019t invest in it, promote it, or test it on patients until the thing had been approved by the FDA or whoever else had to put the seal of approval on it. I damn sure wouldn\u2019t allow our military to be subjected to something so unreliable. Good God! Is common sense dead in the water? It just seemed too far-fetched to me and I really struggled to believe so many wealthy and even powerful people fell under Holmes\u2019 spell so completely.Which of course brings us to the core issue: At the center of all this is Elizabeth Holmes- a greedy sociopath, a megalomaniac- or whatever word you want to use. This woman\u2019s behavior is unconscionable!! She really should be behind bars!! This is a crazy story, just nuts!! You will have to read it to believe it. Now, as far an investigative or true crime book goes- this one is above average, especially give the journalistic background of the author. At times all the medical testing and lab jargon was a bit dry, and sometimes the information or patterns of all the players felt repetitive. The organization of the material was well done, but not as tight as I would have liked. Still, I am thankful the author pursued this story for the WSJ, writing an article which helped to bring down this dangerous company before any truly horrific damage was done!! Theranos ceased operations in August of 2018- Thank God!

This one is awesome. Scary, but awesome.", "The True Cost of IdealismI have been guilty of the grave fault of idealism in much of my professional life. Consequently I cringe when I read of the young Elizabeth Holmes and her idealistic trajectory from the thrilling emotionally-laden launch of Theranos, which promised a breakthrough in medical technology, to its ignominious destruction as a fraudulent scam. In her I see myself - not in her level of talent or her self-confidence but in her profound self-delusion. It is this self-delusion which seems the universal cost of idealism, a cost which is borne not just by the promoter of an ideal but by the rest of the world as well - in her case about a billion dollars in round figures.Idealism sells. What it primarily sells is itself - its promise, its enthusiasm, its own inherent goodness. Modern serial idealists in places like Silicon Valley are idealists about idealism. It is their idealistic energy and talent for putting together pieces in a technological/conceptual/commercial puzzle that gets them what they need: ideas, contacts, talented colleagues, reputation, and money. The code phrase of the idealist is \u2018Making a Difference.\u2019 So Holmes \u201cwanted to truly leave her mark on the world, she would need to accomplish something that furthered the greater good, not just become rich.\u201d But most of all their energy and enthusiasm gets them power, the power to promote their own idealistic self-image. Idealism is always couched in terms of abstract altruism, that is, improving the human condition. But no matter what the area in which a particular ideal is to be pursued - business, politics, medicine, academia - the idealist imperative, his or her sine qua non, is the acquisition and maintenance of power for themselves. Power is a logical and practical prerequisite for the realisation of any ideal. Idealists therefore want to enrol the rest of us in their ideal. This is their route to power. Their role model is not that of Albert Schweitzer or Mother Teresa and the selfless doing of good but that of Pericles and the talking of doing good, usually about what others are required to do to prove their goodness.The world of the idealist is constrained and defined by power regardless of the merits of the ideal put forth as its rationale. Power is the elephant in the room that no one talks about but that must be constantly fed. Eventually there is room for nothing else. The ideal one has started with becomes a nostalgic memory, restored to mind only at the behest of power to increase itself. This is the essential paradox 0f idealism: it will always end in tears.The more articulate and forceful idealists are in presenting their ideal, the more power they accumulate. The idealist is a visionary, a prophet who deserves power because of the strength of their vision and prophetic acumen. Holmes made it clear to her employees that she was \u201cstarting a religion.\u201d It is faith which justifies, for the idealist as for any believer, those actions necessary to acquire power. Chief among such actions is lying. Chronic mendacity is not incidental or exceptional for the idealist. It is a necessary virtue of technique and substance. Lying is expected because all communication is negotiation, is it not? This is the common thread among idealists of diverse backgrounds, views, and personalities. Donald Trump is an entrepreneurial idealist; Benedict XVI is a religious idealist; Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are high-tech idealists; as indeed is Elizabeth Holmes. However else they differ, they share this distinctive trait: they lie instinctively and routinely, and without remorse, indeed, I suspect, without consciousness of lying at all. Although idealists have to be enthusiastic salesmen, they are not mere evangelists who tout the advantages of their ideal, while staying silent about its possible defects or adverse consequences. Idealists are true believers. Unlike typical salesmen they do not present half truths, distortions, overstatement, and tendentious arguments knowing them to be such. They believe firmly in everything they say. They are compelling, even for hard-bitten venture capitalists. The guy Holmes recruited to do the engineering was mesmerised by her take of difference-making: \u201cEdmond, who went by Ed, felt himself drawn in by the young woman sitting across from him who was staring at him intently without blinking. The mission she was describing was admirable, he thought.\u201dThe ideal consumes idealists, including their awareness of reality. In their own minds they do not lie, they convince - themselves as much as others - in order to further the ideal. Lies are aspirational statements not false claims. Their repetition is constructive truth, an embodiment of hope, and a demonstration of that very Christian virtue of faith. So from the start of Theranos, Holmes was faking the results of her diagnostic devices through high-tech trickery - believing, much like Bernie Madoff (another idealist), that the breakthrough was at hand. She was selling nanobot snake oil to West Coast money men at the same time as Goldman Sachs (an exceptionally idealistic firm, just ask them) was pushing its sub-prime portfolios into German pension funds. Same product - efficiency - just different labels, one procedural, the other financial.In short idealism is not merely a neurosis; it is a sociopathology. Idealists don\u2019t simply have ideals; they seek to impose them on the rest of us - at a profit. Idealism is an infection spread from mouth to ear to mouth. As both a philosophy and a practical ethic it is the secular residue of the Christian idea of faith. It may not move mountains directly but it certainly can generate the cash to develop the machines which can. And idealism justifies anything for those who have it; it makes the idealist immune from self-criticism, and indifferent to the consequences of his actions. Idealism certainly gets things done in a world which expects and respects it. But what it gets done is rarely discussed.In business the consequence is constant low-level deceit punctuated by not infrequent criminal fraud; in politics the consequence is extremism and ultimately terrorism; in religion, fundamentalism and doctrinally-justified inhumanity. Idealism, like its progenitor of faith, is something we culturally value. The central question that Bad Blood raises is not legal, or organisational; nor is it essentially about the moral code of Silicon Valley. It is about whether this legacy of what we glibly call Christian civilisation is a salvific virtue or a destructive vice.Postscript: It is also clear that idealists have no shame: https://gizmodo.com/disgraced-therano...", "Early in my career I worked at a next-generation sequencing startup with Theranos-level ambitions. In fact, it went further. The founders\u2019 mission was to cure aging. Literally, the goal was immortality.There were other similarities: The company was founded by wunderkinds, they won the attention and support of a prominent professor in the field, they dropped out and raised millions of dollars from non-hard tech investors off the back of a concept, then tens of millions of dollars off the back of a glued together prototype, all while pursuing a fantastical goal.The company was wild but not fraudulent. Quite the contrary: When the founders realized that the technology was not going to work (or would take many more years to validate) they decided to fold the company. All of the scientists - even the skeptics - were shocked and disappointed. We were on the verge of breaking through in key areas. But, it was over.And, the irony? Many of those scientists went on to work at Theranos. It was just down the street.By 2012 they had all left Theranos. \u2018It's too crazy\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s way worse\u2019. Way worse than an immature company that blew up on a whim? I started following Theranos: the Glassdoor reviews, the funding announcements, the glowing press coverage. It was surreal to know that the company was a fraud and yet to see it rise.Carreyrou exposed it all. How Holmes and Balwani drove an employee to suicide, how they strong-armed employees, investors, even generals and statesmen, how they lied to win multi-million dollar deals from credulous partners. The pulp in Bad Blood is juicy. I read the book on one overseas flight.Theranos is extreme but not singular. Silicon Valley lionizes founders and \u2018overnight\u2019, 100X successes. Investors are pushed & pulled toward a hands-off approach. Founders retain board control and investors don\u2019t meddle. This environment is prime for fraud. My management philosophy: In a vacuum, everyone cuts corners. Everyone gets lazy. And, unscrupulous people do worse.A couple years ago I tweeted: \u2018At what point do high-profile unicorn frauds irreparably damage the philosophy and practice of founder-friendly investors?\u2019 That was about Hampton Creek. It could have been about Zenefits, or Uber (in a sense), or, of course, Theranos. Who will be next? The odds-on favorite is WeWork. Does Tesla (a public company) count? The whisper-consensus has many candidates.There are many frauds left to be exposed. But, none as big as Theranos. Well, maybe one or two.", "\nThis was fucking BANANAS.\n", "Lessons learned:1. Elizabeth Holmes speaks in an unusually deep voice.2. What matters is who you know. If you look good and have the right connections, you can get millions of dollars for your imaginary device, particularly if you model it on the iPhone and dress like Steve Jobs.3. Even very rich people can be stupid with money.4. Sometimes the people that aren\u2019t stupid are only supporting you for the money.Rather outside my normal genres of mystery, sci-fi and fantasy, Bad Blood intrigued me both because of its medical focus and because I heard it was a particularly well-done story. Although I will once again offer up a more appropriate title: Bad Blood Tech, because the blood itself here is perfectly fine. Absolutely normal, in fact. Perfectly healthy blood that\u2019s put into a nefarious machine, sold by a flim-flam operator of the highest level.The storytelling is very straight-forward, generally devoid of literary flourishes and with only minor asides. In fact, at times the writing seems simplistic. On reflection, I think Carreyrou had to keep his sentences as factual as possible, knowing that Holmes\u2019 lawyers would go over every word looking to dispute it. As such, it reads quickly. Until, that is, you you develop Toxic Exposure Syndrome, the experience of immersing yourself in the world of unrepentant and awful people. I found I had to take a break, and once stopped, was reluctant to pick it up. I solved my little dilemma by reading backwards, and was relieved to discover that the narrative eventually switches from the meteoric \u2018rise\u2019 of Thantos to the development of the Wall Street Journal\u2018s expose. That\u2019s when the crazy took an actively evil direction with Thantos harassing former employees, potential sources, and anyone who might speak to Carreyrou about Thantos.What surprised me the most about this story is how many people Elizabeth Holmes was able to convince to part with their money. Sure, it seems she genuinely believed in her product and its potential. But the goal was a product used to test blood for diagnostic purposes. Even the most simple nurse (cough-cough) could tell you that there\u2019s certification involved. This isn\u2019t a Kickstarter for your new book, or a new design for luggage, or even an up-and-coming app that will tell you if the concert you are at will burst your eardrums (this is a thing). Tests almost always have to be run past the FDA. And Holmes never showed anyone proof of such things. Essentially, thanks to an impressive amount of seed money through family connections, she was able to keep her pyramid scam going by finding new people and just enough opportunities to parlay small successes into looking like big ones. Until they turned to outright lies. I will note that many of the scientists and engineers she hired did ultimately quit after sharing their (ethical) concerns with their boss, whose response seems to have been, 'don't worry about it.'I do have to thank Carreyrou, though. We were sitting around work in the break room the other day, in our fifteen by fifteen space shared by roughly twenty people a shift, and someone was commiserating on how awful our jobs were right now. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cat least we have our souls.\u201dThree stars, through no fault of the Author. I just didn't enjoy reading about a rampant narcissist and her team of parasitic lawyers.", "\nHOLY COW. I followed the Elizabeth Holmes/Theranos story slightly but this book does such a fantastic job of showing how completely banana pants this situation was. This was also great on audio, and so addictive that I started making up chores I could do just so I could keep listening.Watch me discuss this book in my July wrap up: https://youtu.be/8kaQcaNn9uw\n", "4.5 Stars\nElizabeth told the gathered employees that she was building a religion. If there were any among them who didn\u2019t believe, they should leave.\nWow! What a powerful story. I'm a fan of financial stories and I personally work in the tech industry so when I heard about this book I knew I had to read it. If you like shows like Shark Tank, I think you will find this story interesting.Elizabeth Holmes is 19 and an incredibly smart girl. She decides to dropout of Stanford because she has an idea for a medical device that could literally change the entire medical industry. The device is supposed to eliminate drawing blood through a large needle and instead simply prick your finger and get results faster. She becomes romantically involved with a guy 20 years her senior named Sunny who becomes a powerhouse at the company. They name the company Theranos. Elisabeth is called the next Steve Jobs. Her company goes and eventually is valued at 9 Billion dollars and she becomes the most valuable female CEO ever. Walgreens and Safeway buy into the idea and invest millions. Other famous names invest as well such as, Rupert Murdoch. This all sounds good and well right? Well what if you worked at a company and found out the entire product was a lie and didn't actually work? What if you realized that the company you are working for made a product that can potentially kill people because the company is faking results and putting innocent lives at risk? Would you quit or say something? If you quit you get harassed & sued (you have to sign an NDA) if you speak a word. If you speak up you immediately get fired and harassed. Let's just say the grass isn't always greener. One day the lies start to come out from a WSJ article when ex-Theranos employees start to speak anonymously...\nBut how could this woman continue to keep this lie going for over 10 years?\nThis story honestly blew me away. I have no idea how large companies such as Walgreens and Safeway were able to not see through the lies. Maybe Elizabeth was an amazing negotiator but if I invested hundreds of millions of dollars and the product wasn't hitting timelines I would end that ASAP. I think that the companies had FOMO (fear of missing out), at least Walgreens did. They were afraid of CVS getting the business instead, only to be duped. The author, who is also the WSJ journalist who broke this story, calls Elizabeth a sociopath. He says they are defined by: not having a conscience in regards to actions they've taken. I'm not sure I would have pegged her as that but when you think about it, she literally could have killed people if doctors actually believe this medical device worked. Luckily, the WSJ article broke before it became a real problem. But morally how can someone do that? Oh and if you look Elizabeth up online she's already starting to try to get people to invest in a new business idea she has. I guess she's moved on...This story was so interesting and I highly recommend for those who enjoy good business scandals/investment stories. It was a wild ride and I also learned a lot about blood science! This definitely lives up to the hype.", "\u201cBad Blood\u201d details the fascinating journey of a brilliant, soulless, young entrepreneur in pursuit of riches and fame. The story has heroes and villains, twisting and turning subplots, political intrigue and -even while we know the eventual outcome- plenty of surprises. It has all the elements of a good fictional thriller, but what makes this story most shocking and intriguing -- is the fact that it really happened. The details in this book will leave you shaking in your boots when you realize the scale of Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 deception and the impact it might have had on public health. While aware of the Theranos story playing out at the time, \u201cBad Blood\u201d provides a more detailed accounting of events. This book doesn't sugar coat the bitter pill and is a triumph of investigative journalism. John Carreyrou's research and reporting for this book were outstanding! By exposing the fraud that Holmes and Theranos were, we now know that intelligent people were duped, money and resources were wasted, and lives were saved. Non-fiction is not really my cup of tea, but I find this captivating , well documented, and it\u2019s narrated like a novel. Don\u2019t let the blood testing science specifics in the first half drive you away --the second half more than makes up for it in drama, and it ramps up at the end. I do carry some doubt that every word written in the book is true. Most of us will never know the whole story, and even every story has two sides. But Holmes certainly didn't make it easy to see her side of the story when all the facts were laid out. I felt Carreyrou tried to give an even hand as much as possible, but the evidence is too damning to be sympathetic on the very long term deception. Transparency and accountability should be paramount in corporate governance, government, and personal relationships --and this is certainly reinforced in this book. While I find it disgusting what Holmes and Balwani did, I\u2019m even more disappointed our society would allow such a sham to be perpetuated. No one brave enough to say \u201cthe emperor has no clothes!\u201dEveryone wanted to believe in the story so badly, that no one did the basic due diligence on many of Theranos\u2019 claims. We should all be grateful that there are people like Tyler Shultz and John Carreyrou out there.", "How does a woman who was once lauded as the youngest self-made female billionaire find herself now broke and charged with fraud? Her face was on the cover of many financial magazines as the golden girl of Silicon Valley, the female Steve Jobs. In her black turtlenecks, she even dressed like Jobs. Elizabeth Holmes had an idea for a medical device that used breakthrough technology that could provide lab results from a simple finger prick and a minuscule drop of blood, and thereby revolutionize the health care industry. Founded in 2003, she raised millions of dollars from investors and named her company Theranos. The problem? The medical device didn\u2019t work. It was all an elaborate scam. Still, the company managed to get Walgreens and Safeway onboard to build on-site clinics and she received multiple awards for her work. Elizabeth was a master manipulator and a dynamic force to be dealt with. She didn\u2019t start out with a plan to scam but she would not accept the fact that her device simply didn\u2019t work. Many people were fooled and she worked her way into rubbing elbows with people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, and Rupert Murdoch. The story is so unbelievable, it reads like fiction. How did she do it? Partly because the company had a culture of intimidation and obsessive secrecy to cover up the fact that it was all smoke and mirrors. And partly because Ms. Holmes had a massive ego. She was charismatic and brilliant but couldn't accept failure.After finishing the book, I spent some time online, still in disbelief that something like this could happen. Kudos to the author, the investigative journalist who blew the cover on this massive fraud. The bigger question? If someone like Elizabeth Holmes could pull off such an elaborate scheme, one that ultimately put patient\u2019s lives at risk, how do we prevent it in the future?A riveting page-turner, and a must-read for everyone! Soon to be a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence.", "A company that set out to save lives\u2026 only to put those same lives in danger with its malfunctioning technology.What a scary and fascinating story. It\u2019s hard to believe that Theranos really happened because you think that nowadays it\u2019s easy to spot liars and lying technologies\u2026 but it\u2019s not that easy after all, especially if the person duping you is as charismatic as this Elizabeth Holmes is. But the main reason why it took a VERY long time for people to catch on that Theranos was doing more harm than good was that people WANTED to believe in the product. If someone is creating a new game and trying to fool you that the game works when it doesn\u2019t, you have doubts pretty early on. But then again, a game is unlikely to change your life like this medical machine promised to do. I, myself, wanted Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s idea to work because how amazing would it have been to have results pretty much instantly and get rid of big scary needles? Pretty darn mind-blowingly amazing. But alas, Ms. Holmes was in no way ready to compromise. She was a CEO alright\u2026 but not a good one. She lied. She hid. She shut down ideas that could have actually made Theranos\u2019 technology work after all. It\u2019s frustrating really. She just couldn\u2019t let go of her idea of making those machines available in people\u2019s houses and miniaturizing medical technology. It took me almost a week to get through this read because it\u2019s a THICK story. It may only have 300 pages but these are PACKED with information and characters. It spans over ten years! But it was hard not to pick it up again every time I needed to put it down because it\u2019s more than just about business and crime\u2014there is so much drama and hope this story could easily be turned into a TV series! Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "I don\u2019t read a lot of nonfiction books. I love the imagination of fiction. When I heard about this book from a television show, it sounded unbelievable. The fact that this was a true story that seemed stranger than fiction, I had to give it a read. I\u2019m really glad I did because this was really good. This story is about the youngest woman, to become a self-made billionaire, and the giant fraud she committed on Silicon Valley. Elizabeth Holmes, was a Stanford drop-out that used her knowledge and family connections to build a billion dollar start-up name Theranos. Theranos invented a blood testing portable machine that could test all the different blood tests a major lab would with just a drop of blood. This was a major breakthrough as it could stop the need for needles and vials of blood sick patients have to constantly be subjected to. Not only that but these machines were to be rolled out in Safeway (a supermarket) and Walgreens (a drug store) all over the USA so everyone could afford to be tested. The problem with this great idea; the machines never actually worked! This truly is one of the biggest scams Silicon Valley had ever seen. The cheating and lies and manipulation are unbelievable. The amount of people Elizabeth managed to bewitch is staggering. These were smart people she swindled. If you live in the USA, you will be shocked by many of the big names that totally fell for the scam. Actually, the names are so big you will probably recognize them even living outside the USA. At one point Elizabeth was worth close to 5 billion dollars. This book is written by the Wall Street Journalist that fought to bring her lies to light. This book is also about the brave men and women who were ex and current employees that risked lawsuits and bullying to blow the whistle. If you have heard about this book and were considering reading it I absolutely recommend it. This is not my normal fiction I love to read, instead it\u2019s the unbelievable truth. ", "Mesmerising. Unbelievable. Compulsively readable. I cannot recommend this highly enough. I sped through this audiobook in a few days because I just could not stop listening to it. There were so many unbelievable things in this true account of the Theranos scam that my mouth dropped open in a way I wouldn't have thought happens in real life.John Carreyrou traces the story of Elizabeth Holmes and her medical start-up Theranos from the beginning with the help of countless interviews and other insights. The picture he paints is breathtaking: of a firm run like a cult, of incompetence that can only be explained by a complete lack of understanding of science by nearly everyone involved, of unethical hounding of those who did see the bad science for what it was. I can tell you, if I can see the science as flawed it is really flawed \u2013 my knowledge of biology and chemistry is lacklustre to say the least.While I overall enjoyed this book a whole lot, there were a few things that did not quite work for me. First and foremost the framing of the story \u2013 as Elizabeth Holmes did not give any interviews for this book, her story is told from the other end, which I am absolutely fine with and I do think Carreyrou did an exceptional job with this, but his clear distaste for Holmes shines through in a way that I did not always appreciate. For example, early on he uses an anecdote of her playing Monopoly with her brothers and being a super sore loser as an indication for how horrible and competitive a person she is \u2013 and I don\u2019t buy that. Lots of kids are sore losers, most of them grow up not scamming patients. I do agree with his assessment that Holmes scammed her investors purposefully and did not care about the patients being misdiagnosed because of her flawed technology but I wish he had let me come to this assessment on my own a bit more.As a case study of how the lack of diverse knowledge can harm a company, this book is priceless. There were many instances where having somebody on the board of directors with just a little bit of knowledge of the science between the big idea would have led to a totally different ending. I would have liked to have seen an analysis of the social structures in place that enabled Holmes to build her company and run it for many years without any pertinent experience as a 19-year-old college dropout just based on knowing the right people and acting the part. But still, this book is amazing in achieving what it set out to do.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.", "A Sanford dropout with no extensive engineering or medical or science or business knowledge 'created' an idea for a product and company that required all of those things. It not only ultimately failed but also put untold numbers of people at risk and harm? You don't say. One thing, for me, that was truly surprising in this story is that the dropout in question wasn't a white male, instead it was a woman, Elizabeth Holmes. Elizabeth Holmes had on the surface a brilliant idea - what if just a couple drops of blood could be used to test multiple health indicators/diseases/chemical levels instead of the large and painful blood draws typically used? Unfortunately this idea was not built on any knowledge of how different types of blood tests work, the limits of accuracy when diluting blood, the difficulties in preventing minute amounts of blood from drying out, and the medicals risks incurred when blood tests cannot be held to the same level of accuracy as normal larger blood draws. So basically her idea was more magical thinking without any actual plan on how to implement it, but that didn't give her pause never mind stop her.This story of how corporate greed and ignorance went unchecked for so long kept me up way past my bedtime. I was completely engrossed, shocked, and dismayed by how this fraud was perpetrated. Even the pharmacy company Walgreen's, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and now ex-Secretary of Defense General Mattis were ultimately involved! ", "From an early age Elizabeth Holmes, wanted to become an entrepreneur, maker her own fortune. Going to Standford, she revered Steve Jobs, and wanted to succeed in a life changing invention of her own. She dropped out of Standford and started her own company. She would Implement, invent and sell a small machine that would only take a pin prick of blood, getting instantaneous results that would allow doctors to make medication changes, much more quickly. Sounds good, many thought so, she raised millions, contracts from leading companies. Many including Joe Biden and Betsy de Boss, contributed money to this promising silicon valley startup. She hired top people in different fields, but soon her company became revolving door as the littlest thing to get someone fired.So what went wrong? How was she able to pull the wool over do many eyes. Smart people, CEOs of leading companies, and the public at large? That is the story Carreyrou uncovered and made public. This journalist from The Wall Street Journal exposes Elizabeth and her company Theranos.This is an engrossing read and another that proves the adage that truth is do often stranger than fiction.", "When we get our blood tested, we naturally assume the results that come back are trustworthy. High LDL cholesterol levels? We're either going to change our diet (whole food plant based is the way to go!), start exercising more, or decide to take statins (tip: WFPB diet and exercise are much better for your overall health than statins). Same thing if our blood work comes back saying we're diabetic. Or any other number of disorders. One thing is certain, when our blood work comes back saying there's something wrong, most of us are going to do something to remedy the problem. We take the results at their word, not second guess them and decide to do nothing. Imagine getting blood work back saying you have cancer. You're going to have a whole lot of stress and worry, hope you have decent health insurance to cover the expensive tests you now need to have before you can start treatment, lose money taking time off work to get tests done, etc. We don't usually question the results of blood work; instead we rely on them to diagnose medical issues or to assure us that we are healthy. Doctors also rely on them, basing 70 percent of their treatment decisions on lab results.Unfortunately, Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos didn't care about the reliability of blood tests. In the early 2000s, she started a company that would, she promised, revolutionize the medical industry. She guaranteed a medical device that patients could have in their own homes which performed hundreds of different blood tests, safely and quickly, and with only a tiny drop of blood. Sounds awesome, doesn't it? No more waiting at least a couple days for results. No more feeling and seeing long needles plunge into your veins, watching (or not watching, in my case!) your blood pour from your body into small tubes. Ick! I get grossed out just thinking about it!  Moving along..... the idea Elizabeth Holmes had was brilliant.... and yet it was just that, an idea. She raised billions of dollars assuring investors that she had a machine that worked and accurately tested blood, quickly and safely. She sold machines to the Mexican government to test for Swine flu (even though she was told you could more accurately test for it through a nasal swab). She signed deals with Walgreens and Safeway and the US military. She became the youngest person to win the Horatio Alger Award. President Obama made her a U.S. ambassador for global entrepreneurship.There was one problem though: the machines didn't actually work. This didn't bother Elizabeth Holmes; she consistently ignored faulty tests and wouldn't listen to her employees when they suggested something was wrong with the technology. She showed not an ounce of regard for patients' well-being; the only thing she seemed to care about was money and fame. She likened herself to Steve Jobs, even going so far as to dress like him, name parts of her lab like he did, and lower her voice several notches to speak more like him. Unfortunately for patients, Ms. Holmes' technology rarely worked, but that didn't stop her from raising billions of dollars and hoodwinking investors and company CEOs alike. I am amazed at how she was able to manipulate people and how these (usually) men took her word that her machines worked, this equipment that could cause suffering and even death to patients if it didn't work. No matter how evasive and dishonest she was, many people couldn't see past her blonde hair and red lips. Thankfully it eventually came out that her technology was not reliable, before it became responsible for the death of anyone. As the author notes, there are \"two nightmare scenarios false blood-test results could lead to. A false positive might cause a patient to have an unnecessary medical procedure. But a false negative was worse: a patient with a serious condition that went undiagnosed could die\". As of the writing of this review, Elizabeth Holmes is awaiting trial on fraud charges, along with her former boyfriend and the company COO \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani.This book is meticulously researched. For me, there was a bit too much detail (I don't care what kind of cars the people in the book drove or where they went to eat) and I think I would have preferred a lengthy magazine article about the story to such a detailed book. I don't care what individual emails said (unless they revealed something new) or who said what about whom. At times, this felt like a gossipy tabloid and at others it was overwhelming with the details. However, it is well-written and well researched and so, whilst it's 3 stars for how much I personally liked it, I think it deserves 4 stars. Unfortunately, I am already cynical and have a difficult time trusting doctors (who often seem to care more about the profits of pharmaceutical companies than about the well-being of their patients) and the for-profit medical system in this country. I think my level of distrust has risen by what I learned in this book. Still, it's always better to be informed.", "Fascinating! Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup is a detailed account of the (perceived) rise and demise of Theranos, a blood testing startup once valued at nearly $9B. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and barely wanted to put it down. It was baffling to read about the scams, stunts and lies this company pulled, led by founder Elizabeth Holmes and her former boyfriend, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani. The red flags surrounding Theranos were rampant, and Carreyrou does an excellent job presenting the full scope of the situation and the company\u2019s timeline.\u201cWhy had Holmes always been so secretive about her technology? Why had she never recruited a board member with even basic knowledge of blood science? And why hadn\u2019t a single venture capital firm with expertise in health care put money into the company?\u201dHolmes was a Stanford dropout who at the age of 19, started Theranos with the intent to revolutionize blood testing using just enough from a finger prick size sample. She exaggerated the company\u2019s technological capabilities and grossly inflated its financial projections, as well as use of its device(s), regulatory approvals obtained, and partnership agreements. \n\u201cTheranos operates under a culture of secrecy and fear.\u201d\n The company was a revolving door for the majority of its existence - Employees were frequently fired for raising any concerns and forced to deal with Balwani, Holmes\u2019 second in command, who, according to the book, was perceived as a tyrant by many. There are plenty of supporting examples for this description of Balwani too. Numerous employees also resigned, unwilling to engage in deceptive, unethical practices and/or impatient with Holmes\u2019 lack of direction, lies, and sharp corner-cutting. In addition to establishing the secretive culture and work environment of Theranos, there is a fair amount of information in Bad Blood regarding the science and technology attempted by the company, as well as its involvement in legal proceedings. Both topics are easily digestible and not written with overly technical language. I am dumbfounded that so many investors just went along with the pitch and that more of them didn\u2019t challenge the constantly ambiguous information being provided. Due diligence is real! It makes you wonder how some people got to where they are. Bad Blood mentions several times that Holmes has a deep voice, often taking many people by surprise. Finally, after reading about it for the 7th time, I Googled a video of her to hear it for myself and I too was taken by surprise - It was not a voice I was expecting! Some former employees noted they suspected it was a front Holmes put on, to be treated equally and gain the same level of respect as men in the male-dominate culture of SV. Maybe, though this seems exhausting - I know I\u2019d be tired from changing my voice that drastically ever time I spoke at work. Holmes had an unabashed fascination with Steve Jobs. It is clear she liked the idea of being perceived as an innovative genius, though she is far from one herself. She wasn\u2019t truly willing to do the hard work with a genuine \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d attitude to get there. Hence the drastic cutting of corners, faulty devices, and unreliable work product of Theranos. She just wanted the fame and fortune, and inflated her sense of worth along the way, hiring excessive security detail and taking up most invitations to speak at industry events. After I finished the book, I found myself reading more about the company and Holmes online, still in disbelief that this BS actually went on for so many years. The following quote from an October 2018 MarketWatch article notes: \u201cAfter Holmes burned through executives, cash, investor goodwill and regulatory patience, nothing of value was left but the company\u2019s patents.\u201dThough Holmes settled her \u201cmassive fraud\u201d charges with the SEC in early 2018, I am extremely curious to see how the remaining various lawsuits will pan out. Part of me suspects wealth and privilege will play a role in saving the day for Holmes, but given the critical nature of Theranos\u2019 deceit (human health), I am hopeful this will not be the case. At some point, we need to bring down the hammer and demand enough is enough - False test results impacting doctors\u2019 treatment plans and patients\u2019 medical decisions seem like a great opportunity to do so.", "Bad Blood is a straightforward read about the rise and fall of Theranos, done in chronological order in third-person up until Carreyrou becomes personally involved, at which point things accelerate to the SEC civil settlement. Carreyrou doesn't end too strongly but says that the criminal investigation may well end up charging Holmes & Sunny. This means that it lacks a really conclusive 'ending': Theranos was continuing to limp on, having received funding from a vulture on the strength of its patent portolio, ironically enough, which apparently was valued at $1b, and Carreyrou mentions in one interview that Holmes was reportedly scouting VCs for a new startup. (After reading BB, I had to think: maybe a second Holmes startup isn't a bad idea - after all, if she could get this far with no working product at all, what could she do with an actual product? It may look bad, but it'd probably work better than most startups.) Coincidentally, I began reading this just hours before Holmes & Sunny were criminally indicted (vindicating what I had been telling people - the SEC civil settlement didn't mean they were going to get off scot-free). Good timing on my part. This puts more of a period on reading BB, although the story is far from over. There's a quip that the most American character is the conman, because America is the land of second chances - Elizabeth Holmes is only 34 years old, after all, and even having aggravated the DoJ by persisting with Theranos, it's hard to imagine her being sentenced (as a woman and without a lot of bodies and without Shkreli's autistic genius for infuriating judges) to more than a few years at worst, so I wonder if we've seen the last of her?In any case, BB is good for resolving a lot of details about Theranos.For example, I was perplexed at the time by the large Walgreens deal: Walgreens is a large, competent, sophisticated provider of pharmacy services, well capable of thorough testing; if Theranos was not what it was hyped up to be, how could Walgreens fail to notice? My assumption was that Theranos had done something clever to produce fake results (if not perhaps as clever as the FSB at Sochi). BB provides the answer, which is dismayingly mundane: Theranos bluntly refused to provide any kind of real validation or access to its machines, and some Walgreens execs were furious about it and correctly convinced Theranos was a fraud, but others were seduced by the vision, and the doubters signed on because they were terrified of forcing Theranos into the arms of CVS, which is a rivalry I had no idea about. (\"Van den Hooff listened with a pained look on his face. 'We can't not pursue this,'' he said. 'We can't risk a scenario where CVS has a deal with them in six months and it ends up being real.' Walgreens's rivalry with CVS, which was based in Rhode Island and one-third bigger in terms of revenues, colored virtually everything the drugstore chain did. It was a myopic view of the world that was hard to understand for an outsider like Hunter who wasn't a Walgreens company man. Theranos had cleverly played on this insecurity. As a result, Walgreens suffered from a severe case of FOMO - the fear of missing out.\" Who knew?) A similar desperation appears to have animated Safeway's ill-fated Theranos commitment. And the general coverup appears to have owed much to the realities of lawfare in the USA: Theranos had enough cash to wield legal threats against the justly-terrified whistleblowers, costing Tyler Shultz a staggering $400,000+ and gaslighting suspects with constant PI surveillance, and possibly tactics that went beyond the legal (Theranos/Holmes appear suspiciously well-informed at times). It's no surprise it took a major newspaper like the WSJ to investigate it.It's also interesting for the unexpected details. For example, dressing like Steve Jobs wasn't Holmes's idea! She was told to do it by one of her ex-Applers. And her family connections were dangerous as much as they were helpful: the shiny board of directors, for everyone it impressed, put other people off and made them suspicious, and without her family connections, the family friend Richard Fuisz would never have tried to patent-troll her out of peevish spite which directly fed into the first Fortune article and eventually Carreyrou's own investigation. (With 'family friends' like these, who needs enemies?)And Carreyrou is good about considering to what extent Theranos really reflects on SV: as he points out, a lot of the actual investors were 'dumb money' (my phrase) who did minimal real due diligence and ignored red flags, like Rupert Murdoch who put in $125m on the basis of 2 meetings with Holmes and a phone call to someone else, while the usual life-sciences VCs were unimpressed with Holmes's bluster & ignorance and took a total pass on her. (Google Ventures took a hard pass when their guy walked into a Walgreens and Theranos couldn't do the test using just a nanotainer of his blood - a simple test that many others also did but then ignored the excuses and failures.) Culturally, Theranos was barely SV: yes, Apple may have fanatical internal secrecy, but they are the exception that proves the SV rule and have suffered for it (in machine learning especially), while everyone else adopts considerably more internal transparency for precisely the reasons that Theranos employees cite - how do you sanely do R&D if no one is allowed to talk to each other? (Again, Apple has suffered for this in trying to keep up in non-materials-science and non-manufacturing R&D, like machine learning: what's the last impressive new tech you can think of which was developed inside Apple?) It's not really that easy to draw a novel lesson here. Was Theranos initially too ambitious? Perhaps, but lots of startups scale back or pivot to new ideas based on their trial-and-error; reality cannot be planned out. Did it get too much money? It raised $6m initially, which is not that much for their purpose. Should new startups not be funded at all or not allowed a decade+ to work out ideas, or Walgreens blamed for seizing on a new opportunity as fast as possible? But people already complain about investors being too risk-averse and short-term (despite Theranos being 17 years old now!) and companies being bloated slow bureaucracies. Was the problem lack of 'peer review'? Except peer review doesn't work and isn't scientific, works the worst in cases of fraud (think of all the cases of people fabricating scores or hundreds of papers which slide through 'peer review' only to finally be exposed not by 'peer review' but when the results failed to replicate), and would've been inferior to simply seeing if the tests worked or not, and that's how all the smart money like Google Ventures took a pass on Theranos. Should we outlaw investing millions of dollars based on a phonecall? Hard to imagine that working out well. Should we criticize VCs for being gullible? But most of the VCs (not) involved weren't gullible! Should we criticize the board for letting her accumulate so much stock and then letting her talk them out of firing her in 2008? Probably, yes, but hindsight is 20/20 and the worst problems hadn't happened yet. Should blood testing in general be verboten to investors? But Holmes is very, very, far from the first person to try to improve on existing blood tests and fail, much like the perennially fruitless quest for a Alzheimer's disease cure - a good book on this topic is John Smith's \nThe Pursuit of Noninvasive Glucose Blood Tests: \"Hunting the Deceitful Turkey\"\n documenting the endless failure of people trying to improve on finger-stick blood glucose tests for diabetics - and people keep trying because anyone who succeeds will make so much money because the human costs of failing to succeed is measured in hundreds of millions or billions of lives over the coming centuries, and failure is simply not an acceptable option.Carreyrou suggests toward the end that Holmes might have psychopathic traits:A sociopath is often described as someone with little or no conscience. I'll leave it to the psychologists to decide whether Holmes fits the clinical profile, but there's no question that her moral compass was badly askew. I'm fairly certain she didn't initially set out to defraud investors and put patients in harm's way when she dropped out of Stanford fifteen years ago. By all accounts, she had a vision that she genuinely believed in and threw herself into realizing. But in her all-consuming quest to be the second coming of Steve Jobs amid the gold rush of the \"unicorn\" boom, there came a point when she stopped listening to sound advice and began to cut corners. Her ambition was voracious and it brooked no interference. If there was collateral damage on her way to riches and fame, so be it.I think this is wide of the mark and he gets closest in the final lines. What is the stereotypical profile of psychopathy? One might put it as: someone who is unable to make or commit to plans, who acts spontaneously on selfish and often self-destructive impulses, covering up for it with manipulation of others or with even more brazen deceptions often so ill-thought-out & easily falsified as to beggar belief, with a history of violence (often unreported) and especially sadistic cruelty (often emerging during childhood and focusing on animals), unable to maintain long-term relationships, sexually promiscuous and often impregnating or pregnant at an early age, often below average intelligence, greedy and covetous of money or rewards, apt to embezzle or steal from employers, typically racing from employer to employer to outrun immune systems etc.The portrait of Holmes in BB is very far from this. There is no hint of tendencies towards sadism or violence in her childhood, merely a mention of competitiveness. Holmes is, at least initially, quite bad at self-presentation: One quoted VC paraphrased describes her early pitches as unimpressive: \"she'd come off as a dowdy young scientist back then, wearing Coke-bottle glasses and no makeup, speaking nervously to an audience of men two to three times her age\" and Carreyrou points out (to my surprise) that her Jobsian wardrobe wasn't even her idea - but that of an Apple designer she hired:Ana felt that Elizabeth could use a makeover herself. The way she dressed was decidedly unfashionable. She wore wide gray pantsuits and Christmas sweaters that made her look like a frumpy accountant. People in her entourage like Channing Robertson and Don Lucas were beginning to compare her to Steve Jobs. If so, she should dress the part, she told her. Elizabeth took the suggestion to heart. From that point on, she came to work in a black turtleneck and black slacks most days.An additional interesting thread throughout BB (although Carreyrou puts no emphasis on this and I wonder if he missed the connection) is how Holmes continuously sought to amass more stocks or voting control of Theranos: one oddity in the end of the Theranos saga was that Holmes was never, and could not be, fired because she continued to own so much stock and voting power. Rather than selling out early and retiring to a life of leisure, she held on to the bitter end. This is particularly striking because, if I'm reading the timeline and indictment right, Theranos reached valuations of $50m+ long before Holmes/Sunny ever did anything that was truly fraud and irreversible; as far as I can tell, Holmes could have sold millions of dollars of stock and left at many points, entirely safely, and when Theranos ran out of runway, it would be regrettable but nothing she could go to prison for. Instead, she invested considerable efforts into clawing back the large, near co-founder-level stake of her first employee, to the point of threatening to sue an extremely wealthy director who wanted to buy some of it himself rather than giving it to her at a huge discount; she further proposed in 2007 allotting a block of stock to a nonprofit foundation in perpetuity (controlled by, of course, herself); and whenever an employee was fired, Theranos practice seems to have been to carefully hunt using coworkers & laptops & files for any reason, no matter how spurious, to clawback stock options.And in Theranos's mismanagement, we don't see much that could be described as sadistic beyond ordinary bounds - indeed, the 'disappearing' is about separating people from Theranos as quickly and totally as possible, rather than toying with their prey. The disappearing served a useful role in enforcing compartmentalization, risk-aversion, and covering up information, but might there not be another reason?Ian Gibbons puts his finger on it exactly when he said that \"It's a \nfolie \u00e0 deux\n.\" Or perhaps it would be more precise to invoke narcissistic personality disorder and compare Elizabeth Holmes to Donald Trump.Holmes did not start off as a psychopath determined to rip off VC and SV by using her cunningly honed social skills and sexuality to manipulate horny old white men, as one narrative goes. She was a normal ambitious Stanford undergrad (having met a dozen or so Stanford undergrads recently, Holmes now seems much more understandable to me), perhaps a little too eager to launch a startup, with delusions of grandeur about a entrepreneurial destiny and a bit of a chip on her shoulder; for reasons which cannot be known (as counterfactuals are not observable), she got lucky or was female or had family connections or something and she got some VC and support from her professors for what was a more feasible sort of idea which might've been workable, dropped out for a startup, was mentored by the likes of Larry Ellison (surely a red flag if ever there was one), hooked up with an entrepreneur even luckier & more delusional in a remarkably long-term monogamous relationship, selected for employees who initially offered helpful advice in fitting into SV tropes & self-presentation but gradually were recycled into sycophants and slaves, and developed her reality-distortion field abilities through practice and self-persuasion and a cultivated paranoia/martyr complex, and mutual narcissistic feedback loops with true-believer employees and Sunny and eventually the media, 'vanishing' anyone who threatened to damage her narcissistic supply and punishing them for being wretched hateful human beings and endangering the mission, all of which lasted for many years (while Theranos was only truly in the public eye from 2014-2017, the first version was founded in 2003, fully 11 years before!). That's very different, even if the end game, where criminal fraud and blatant lies are necessary to keep the show going, looks similar.", "\n Money isn't the root of all evil. GREED is.....\nA Fascinating story, a tale of corporate fraud and a Journalist who uncovers the biggest corporate fraud since Enron. An intriguing story about a college dropout by the name of Elizabeth Holmes who becomes by the age of twenty nine, CEO of a company called Theranos and Silicon Valley\u2019s first ever female billionaire entrepreneur but by 2018 was facing federal charges of massive fraud which could see her facing up to 20 years in prison. I knew nothing about Elizabeth Homes or Theranos but this was an interesting and detailed account about of her amazing rise to fame and her demise and how one reporter uncovered a massive fraud. I think what shocked me most about this book was the gullibility of people in power and how the wealthiest are held in such high esteem that a fraud of this nature could go unnoticed for so long. There are a lot of employees names, medical and legal jargon to get through in this story and it was by times quite repetitive but I do understand it was necessary to the story, however I felt it dragged the story down and hence my 3 star rating. Having said that what an eye opener of a story that has to be read to be believed. There are photos included in the book but I did a little googling after I had finished as I just had to hear \u201c the voice of Elizabeth Holmes\u201d", "What an audacious fraud! Elizabeth Holmes must be the Queen of self-hype to get so many powerful (and allegedly smart) men to support this scheme (Jim Mattis! Henry Kissinger!). I would enjoy seeing both her and Sunny Balwani in jail, for what they'd done not only to their customers, but their employees.Although I am not a fan of Wall Street Journal and the baloney they peddle in their opinion pieces, I was impressed by how their investigative department stood up against legal pressures from Theranos. Real journalism is great!", "Well, friends, by now I\u2019ve read this here book, I\u2019ve listened to The Dropout podcast, and I\u2019ve watched that crazy ole HBO documentary where Elizabeth Holmes stared at me with those creepy, unblinking eyes in front of a white background. I think I\u2019ve covered the story from every angle, consumed it in three different ways, and now I\u2019m wondering how I missed this story when it was a thing. Before all the books and documentaries and stuff. Oh well. It\u2019s always good to read a book directly from the source/ in this case WSJ\u2019s own John Carreyou. He\u2019s the guy who busted this thing open, and when he gets to that point in his little book here you can almost picture him all giddy at his computer, furiously typing away with his fingers just bouncing off the keys and his legs shaking under the table, a big grin on his face, standing up to clap and throw his hand into the air with a loud Ric Flair \u201cWoo!\u201d as he wraps up the chapter. But it\u2019s the details he pulls out along the way that make this book so captivating. He unravels things slowly, introducing us to the vast amount of characters and the Theranos headquarters, making us feel like we\u2019re an employee working in a fake lab. But it\u2019s the story the book is telling that is so unbelievable, as if this must actually be a fiction book because this couldn\u2019t actually happen, right? Somewhere along he way this guy must be embellishing or maybe this is just based on true events and not a true event itself. There\u2019s no way this could have actually been pulled off. It\u2019s a cautionary tale of what money and power can do. I still don\u2019t know if Holmes started with good intentions of changing the healthcare industry and saving lives only to get in way too deep, or was her goal always to just lie and cheat her way into fame and fortune? And why the scary low voice? There are so many intriguing things surrounding this story. It\u2019s now spawned a movie and a Hulu series so we are nowhere close to done with this. There\u2019s also a real life trial coming with real life consequences. This is the only the beginning, and now I\u2019m fully invested to find out where this all ends. ", "Just when I thought all reporters ever did anymore was see what was trending on social media and write stories with titles like \"You'll cheer how this mom clapped-back at her body-shamers on Twitter,\" this book gives me hope that old-fashioned investigative journalism is alive and well and doing exactly what it's supposed to: shine an unflinching hot light on those who abuse their power and privilege. Here, it's aimed at the bizarre cult of Elizabeth Holmes and her \"disruptive\" \"game changing\" company, Theranos.Silicon Valley is the epitome of mediocrity dressed-up as brilliance. Having wasted several years of my career working for two different Valley-based \"start-ups\" (one now on its 18th year of \"staring up\"), I saw a lot of familiar patterns in this thorough, well-organized and well-told story of how a teenaged college drop-out with all the right connections managed to bamboozle people who we would otherwise assume should know better. There was the usual unprofessional office behavior, the disorganization, the endless cheerleading bordering on religious hysteria about how \"we're changing humanity!\" all wrapped with the constant disregard for convention and ethics and the truth. In this case, there were a few new wrinkles: complete contempt for the law, and a willingness to bully people to the bitter end to protect their lies.Although free of literary license and told straight-ahead as a journalistic piece, this book still reads a bit like a thriller. This could easily be adapted to a psychological horror movie, where young impressionable minds sold on the lie that Silicon Valley is full of the world's smartest people operating on a higher plane of existence go to work for a \"disruptive\" start-up, only to slowly have their perception of reality warped by the bullies running the place until they doubt themselves and everything they knew. At the top we have the calm, collected evil genius of Elizabeth Holmes, dressed the part all in black, speaking in hypnotic, reality-distorting tones, staring unblinking at you with massive blue eyes; to her right is her henchman and lover, a mysterious and wealthy older man named Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, who dishes out abuse, punishments, diatribes, and hatchet jobs with complete impunity, to the point you can hear the evil music swell every time his name is mentioned. In the Hollywood version of this story, he would get his comeuppance by being tossed from a cliff, to an eruption of cheers in the theater. (In real life we have to settle for an ongoing criminal investigation.) Backing them up are the tentacles of a powerful law firm; the mere mention of their name sends shivers down people's spines and causes them to give up before they even start. They deploy a nationwide network of spies who know your every move, and who almost literally leap out of the shadows (or in one case, down the stairs) to serve you with papers and bully you into signing away your life.The duping of so many otherwise smart people is like a real-life retelling of \nBeing There\n, where everyone believes that Holmes is a genius for no other reason than everyone else believes she is a genius. There is a passage of a recalled conversation with brand-name people attributing high qualities to her that she herself probably didn\u2019t even say. Once again \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d took a back seat to \u201cwanting to believe,\u201d reminding us of how Bernie Madoff managed to scam a different group of supposedly smart people. Apparently no one is immune to magical thinking.The author did an amazing job exposing this entire sham and documenting it in a way that gives a complete and chronological picture of what is likely just an extreme example of business-as-usual in Silicon Valley. The difference here is the scope and gravitas, since instead of a forgettable and unimportant software company, Theranos was a healthcare provider, operating in a heavily regulated industry, producing flawed results that directly affected patients' lives. (One person, for example, was out over $3,000 in unnecessary medical tests due to an erroneous blood diagnosis from Theranos. At least no one died, though another person is suing for a heart attack he said could have been prevented if their test had been accurate.) It was also an extreme example of paranoia and litigious bullying, using investor money to buy the finest in legal muscle to intimidate anyone and everyone: former employees, former board members, the journalist who broke the story (this book's author), the  Wall Street Journal itself\u2014even the doctors and patients who complained about faulty test results received a personal visit from Sunny, where he threatened to ruin their careers if they didn\u2019t sign away their right to complain. It was one step below a global drug cartel.So even if you never heard of Theranos before this scandal (like me), or are sick of seeing Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 turtlenecked head all over the internet (also like me), this book is definitely worth reading, even if just for the schadenfreude it inspires. And hopefully it will burst people\u2019s notion that the Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cdisruption\u201d is somehow wonderful. Far from being a bastion of the future, the Valley is firmly stuck in the past of its gold-rush days, and this book shows just how far some of those opportunists will go to protect their gains, even if at the expense of employees, investors, patients, doctors, regulators, and any one else they perceive as a threat. Perhaps next time, people will actually do their due diligence.Most of all, I'm just thankful that real investigative journalism is alive and well and keeping us safe and free. Buy this book if for no other reason than that.", "I loved (and was disturbed by) every second of this. It's the exact kind of investigative story that I find fascinating filled with strange figures, secrecy, and moments that will make you say \"how is that possible?!\" Not only an incredible story, but Carreyrou does an absolutely wonderful job in telling it. Though some of the science is fairly complex, he's able to explain it clearly enough to show you just how critical Theranos' missteps were and the impact it had on real people's lives. I powered through because I just had to know how it all would play out; and even though I knew the general outcome in the end from the news, that didn't take away from the power of the story.Stories like this really make you question important things like, do you ever really know a person? How can we be so blinded by what's right in front of us? What is our duty when it comes to protecting ourselves versus protecting others? And how do we allow our desires and fantasies to keep us from seeing reality? Incredibly thought-provoking, well told, and simultaneously infuriating, this all makes for a great read.", "If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Con-Artist: \"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\" by John CarreyrouThis story is fascinating. Yes, how was she able to rationalize lying and endangering so many -- investors, Walgreens, and especially the general public? It was good this book went into her family of origin. Holmes' father expected her to do something that would change the world. Did Elizabeth feel pressure to be some sort of genius influencer? She had this idea that couldn't work. She was told that it couldn't work by experts. Did some experts give her false hope? Did she intend to run this fraud forever, or did she have some hope that it would eventually work?\ufeff", "A captivating, interesting, and (almost) unbelievable story.

Elizabeth Holmes was the founder and CEO, her goal was to revolutionize the healthcare industry and, at some point, she was compared to the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.What very few knew is that the company devices did not work properly and her claims were, mostly, misleading and false.

Oftentimes, you have to stop reading completely because the words are so good and you're so full of excitement and love that you need to expend some of that energy, otherwise you'll just spontaneously combust!It\u2019s that feeling of finally finding something that is all-encompassing enough to hold your full attention and something inside of you just awakens and I love it!!\u2728 so what is this book about?Jude is the bastard daughter of the runaway wife of a Fae general who murdered both of her parents then brought her to a land coiled in the heart of the forest, brimming of monsters and wolves on the prowl, and raised her like a trueborn child of Faerie, despite not having a drop of faerie blood.Jude grew up where the wild is. She learned to keep her head down and pretend the fear away. She endured the contempt of the Fae, swallowed her fear and saw it through. She was the human girl who got pushed to the sidelines, written as a footnote in someone else's story, and always treated as an afterthought.Jude didn't fit into the borders they gave her. She didn't fit into the ways they saw her. She didn't fit and the moment she stopped wishing she could be and instead, held onto the lingering bitter urge to make them all hurt, she\u2019s learned that being ruthless in the face of great terror was her best revenge for being made to endure it.\n\u201cI want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal.In my heart, I yearn to best them.\u201d\nSo, she's traveled in the direction of her fear and let herself be spiraled up into a world of alliances, of fractured loyalties, of deceit, of political games and spilled secrets that chased everyone into their graves. She's joined a nest of spies and assassins and eventually, she's become one. However, now that she's tasted the brine of darkness, it threatened to swallow everything she has worked so hard to build.\n\u201cI have lied and I have betrayed and I have triumphed. If only there was someone to congratulate me.\u201d \nThis book was a wild ride. It was a whole blanket and it was near impossible to isolate the threads. My stress levels surpassed Joyce Byers in literally every episode of Stranger Things. Nonethless, just so you all know\u2026\u2026. if at any point in my lifetime the opportunity arises for me to retreat into this book and into the world of Fae, and politics\u2026\u2026\u2026.I'm gone. Especially if I could run in the hallways of a castle wearing an exquisite silk gown or given an ancient elaborate dagger with my name engraved into the blade as a gift!\u2728 the characters:My favorite thing about this book is how my feelings for the characters seemed to ebb and flow. The biggest plot twist that\u2019s happened is probably the fact that characters I first wished I could strangle with limp noodles became my favorites and others I liked, I\u2019ve grown to absolutely hate. Basically, what I'm saying is that most of these characters are like face masks for my soul; the rest, I\u2019ll see in hell.\ud83c\udf1f JUDEI don\u2019t know if anyone can put into words my unending love for Jude. In fact, I'm sure the only romance in this book was between Jude and whoever was reading it.Jude is a volcano, her heart made of molten, ready to burn the world alive. She radiates such a petrifying energy and I\u2019m not sure I can quite describe it. It\u2019s not exactly bad but it\u2019s not warm either. I feel like she could seriously unhinge my jaw and drag me into the ocean like a kraken but she wouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s undignified, you know what I mean??I love how she was afraid, but did everything anyway. How she didn\u2019t wait to be confident. How her actions stemmed in fear but she didn\u2019t let it deter her from telling the world that she was important through the ways she carried herself and realizing that in order to be what she wanted to be, she needed to take it.\n\u201cInstead of being afraid, I will become something to fear.\u201d\nAnd honestly, I can't wait to see her fully transform into the wronged, fallen angel look she was meant for!!\ud83c\udf1f PRINCE CARDANSometimes, you just have to....you know, *makes heart gestures and motions that probably mean love* root for the most morally questionable asshole.Listen, I spent a good portion of this book violently wishing Cardan would get dry skin that no lotion can moisturize. However, by chapter 23, I was smiling at myself and thinking, \u201cwhat a fucking loser\u201d but like\u2026in the purest and most loving way possible. Besides, if Holly Black really wanted me to hate him, she shouldn\u2019t have given him a strong jawline and put a crown of flowers on his silky black hair. I am too damn weak!Cardan is the cruel prince but then again, they ALL are. The only difference, I suppose, is the High King's sentiment towards them, which roughly translates to: \"when my sons were born, the sun shone bright upon their beautiful faces.....I found Cardan on the sidewalk outside a taco bell.\"Prince Cardan is an elitist prick (I mean, he is) and simultaneously a traumatized victim of years of neglect and systematic emotional and physical abuse. He was cruel by necessity. He grew up in a house where he always had to be clever and cunning to figure out the right thing to say, the right way to act in order to not set his abusive brother off, to estimate how to quickly diffuse bad situations, to find quick ways to escape an escalating argument. He became ambitious only in wanting to get away from his royal family. Cardan was a forged facade and oftentimes, not even he knew which face he was wearing.I am in no way condoning the many contentious actions he's done but my heart still holds a soft spot for him. Because underneath the armor he's built up for himself, there's a complete trainwreck of a person (shows up drunk on the day of his brother's coronation + copes with having a crush by aggressively writing her name on a crumpled piece of paper + has enormous character flaws that he had no intention of working on + has zero sense of self preservation + drinks wine & plays cards with his kidnappers because at this point why not + extreme cynicism towards self + is generally really sarcastic for someone who\u2019s about to start crying most of the time).\ud83c\udf1f JUDE & CARDANWhy can\u2019t I cope with life without depending on the relationship status between two fictional characters???I don\u2019t even want a relationship. I just want to be like them and have a supreme enemy I can make out with sometimes in secret and who\u2019s obligated to stroke my hair and tell me I'm the bane of their existence but they like me anyway!! \ud83c\udf1f GENERAL MADOCMadoc would be so disappointed in all my life decisions, but I feel like I would need that and once he was done telling me to buck up, we would hug and he would give me a cool engraved sword and I would cry and it would all be fine!!Madoc is such a dynamic and well-written villain. And I appreciate his character while also recognizing the fact that he is evil and selfish and has done many terrible, terrible things. He\u2019s full of good intentions that twist on the way out, a warped sense of loyalty and a semblance of love that is so misguided and yeah occasionally, it murders things. He\u2019s built this contoured version of the truth with urban decay setting spray that he can stand to look at, because at the end of the day no one wants to believe they\u2019re the villain in the story.\n\u201cSome are good with pipes or paint. Some have skill in love,\u201d he says finally. \u201cMy talent is in making war. The only thing that has ever kept me awake was denying it.\u201d\nI also appreciate the fact that he refused to switch sides due to his own personal convictions, that not even his love for his family could sate his thirst for power and bloodshed and wasn't eventually \u201credeemed\u201d by being forced into an out of character relationship. I just [clenches fist] really love it when VILLAINS ARE LEFT TO BE VILLAINS.\ud83c\udf1f VIVIENNEI loved Vivi from the get go BUT the minute I learned she was bisexual? she went from a 10 to a 52124822179 real fast.Vivi is Jude's half sister, and general Madoc's legitimate daughter. She's soft, kind and loving but also takes nobody's shit and she\u2019s seen so much sadness and heartache because she\u2019s that friend that everyone unloads on and I hope she takes a bit of me time for herself and her human girlfriend, maybe a hot bath and some jasmine scented candles too. Please, they deserve it!!\ud83c\udf1f LOCKEI have never, in my entire life, gotten into a fist fight but you best believe if I ever meet this piece of shit, I would immediately start swinging. I can deal with literally any ship in this book happening, but if my OTP (Locke/a horrible death) doesn\u2019t become canon, I will throw a fit.I don't even know what to tell you about Locke. But, you know how some shows bring in a love triangle just to try and up the ratings?? that's basically what Locke is trying to do with his life. He\u2019s wishing into existence his own revenge fantasy novel without taking into account real life consequences people face and gets off on watching girls duelling like we're in an episode of yu-gi-oh. what, pray tell, the actual fuck??\ud83c\udf1f TARYNOh, Taryn, such a delightfully paradoxical character: she's a dick despite not actually having one.I hate her so much I wish she would just go take a dip in a lava pool on a 130 degree day at the zenith of a southern summer in satan\u2019s buttcrack. Honestly, the level of Done that I am with her is utterly insurmountable. Someone fly her to a golf halfway around the world and just leave her there. Please.Anyway, that's all!! if any of you guys need me, I'll be down here on the floor, dying and slowly fading into an elaborately constructed maladaptive landscape where my favorite characters are well and content and I don't have to wait an entire year to find out.\u2728 wishlist \u2728 blog \u2728 twitter \u2728 tumblr \u2728", "\n\n\u201cHe looks like a faerie lover stepped out of a ballad, the kind where no good comes to the girl who runs away with him.\u201d\n\nIf you guys ever want to see what my true heart\u2019s desires are on paper, read this book. This book is a piece of heaven that was sent from above, this book is the perfection incarnate, this book is nothing short of magical, this book easily makes my top five books of all-time list, and this book is without a doubt the best book I\u2019ve read in 2017. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m even going to attempt to come up with a review fitting for this masterpiece, but I\u2019m going to try. Okay, maybe I should start this review off with a personal story. You know, full disclosure and all that. I was a young girl, at the mall with my mom, and we walked into a Borders Outlet. I\u2019ve always been a rather ravenous reader, but at that time in my reading life I was reading only crime thrillers. Think things like James Patterson and John Grisham. Well, while I was perusing the new releases on this autumn day back in the 2007, a worker came up to me and started talking to me about her love for books, but more importantly her love for fae books. She was so kind and warm and enthusiastic, I couldn\u2019t help but ask her to pick me one of her favorite fae stories. Well, she ended up handing me two, but one of them was Tithe by Holly Black, and this godsend Borders Outlet employee completely changed me and my reading life forever. After that day, and after I inhale read that book, Holly Black became one of my favorite authors and my parents couldn\u2019t keep unread fae fantasy books on my shelves. And ten years later, I\u2019ve never looked back. I\u2019ve been completely obsessed with fae stories ever since. And if I ever develop magical powers, one of the first thing I\u2019m going to do is track down that Borders Outlet employee and thank her for making me the reader that I am today. Okay, sappy and heartwarming story aside, this book was honestly perfection in every aspect. You want fae courts? Bloodthirsty fae royals fighting for a crown? Twists after twists and reveals after reveals? Heartwarming scenes followed by heart wrenching scenes? The slowest and most agonizing but also the most romantic and powerful and rewarding hate to love romance in the world? Pick this book up.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re like a story that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.\u201d\n\nAnd the writing? I mean, not only is Holly Black the literal queen of all things fae, she is also the queen at stringing together words that make me feel everything in the entire universe. The amount of sticky notes and highlights I have in this book is ridiculous, but Holly Black\u2019s writing is so poignant and lyrical and honestly the most perfect thing my eyes have ever seen. This entire book reads like one giant tragic ballad, yet it is equal parts heartbreak and hope. This book is so haunting, so dark, and so twisted. \n\n\u201cBut I will not stand in front of your happiness. I will not even stand in front of misery that you choose for yourself.\u201d\n\nJude is a very young girl when she witnesses her parents murder. After that terrible night, she and her sisters are whisked away by the murderer to live in Faerie. Now, ten years later, Jude is trying to live among the fae, while constantly being reminded of her mortal human status. Yet, she soon gets wrapped up in a very elaborate game, from many different sides, which will cause a civil war to break out in the Courts of Faerie if the game isn\u2019t played properly.The High King has ruled for centuries, but people feel like it is finally time for him to step down and give the royal crown to one of his children. In this world, the king chooses his successor; it doesn\u2019t automatically go to the oldest child. And the High King has six children in line waiting for him to make his choice. Prince Cardan is the youngest son of the High King. He is wicked, and charming, and smart, and maybe even a little cruel. Oh, and he makes Jude\u2019s life a living hell most of the time. He\u2019s also one of the best characters I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. And with Cardan, comes his group of friends: Nicasia who likes power, Valerian who likes violence, and Locke who likes dramatics, but they all love tormenting Jude in very different ways.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what comes of hungering for something; you forget to check if it\u2019s rotten before you gobble it down\u201d\n\nEven though Jude is the only point of view, and is the main protagonist of this amazing story, her two sisters play a huge part of this story, too. Taryn is Jude\u2019s twin, who must watch all the torment that Jude endures, and Vivi is their older sister and one of the best side characters I\u2019ve ever read. She\u2019s unique and defiant and strong and devoted, and her romance with her girlfriend meant everything to me. Also, Vivi is on the page bisexual and that representation meant even more than everything to me. Oh, and speaking of adorable queer relationships; Ben and Severin, from The Darkest Part of the Forest, make a cameo in this and I was crying the happiest tears! I don\u2019t think I will ever be over THAT whisper, and I\u2019ve just completely accepted that. Be still, my heart.But Jude is our main character of this story, and you can tell from everything that I\u2019ve written above that she doesn\u2019t have the easiest of lives. See, the fae in this world are very dependent on humans, even though they remind them of their lower status constantly, because the fae women have a very hard and sporadic time conceiving and bearing children, therefore, they rely on humans reproducing for them. Well, Jude doesn\u2019t want that life, she wants to make a name for herself and be one of the greatest knights that the Courts of Faerie have ever seen!Jude is strong willed and very determined, but she is also one of the most selfless characters I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reading from. She is a very morally grey character, yet she will completely capture your heart. But she\u2019s young and learning that love comes in very different forms, and sometimes we are unable to control what we feel.\n\n\u201cI stand in front of my window and imagine myself a fearless knight, imagine myself a witch who hid her heart in her finger and then chopped her finger off.\u201d\n\nOne of the most beautiful things about this book is that none of these characters are perfect. Jude, Cardan, all of them do bad things, and none of them are ever excused of their crimes, but they learn to deal with them and the other ramifications that come from their actions. I mean, none of us are perfect people, and we all make bad choices at times. But this book accepts that and reflects that, but also highlights the importance of growing, and becoming a stronger person, and picking what battles you choose to fight. It\u2019s a truly beautiful message and I really appreciated having a full cast of nonperfect characters that do nonperfect things. \n\n\u201cBut we all want stupid things. That doesn\u2019t mean we should have them.\u201d\n\nAlso, this is a spoiler free review, but I just have to yell from the rooftops say that Chapter 26 is the best chapter I\u2019ve read in all of literature. I will fight anyone that says otherwise. Chapter 26 tortured me, broke up, killed me, rebirthed me, and gave me new life. The end of Chapter 25 through Chapter 26 was the most romantic scene my eyes have ever witnessed. I feel so blessed to have even been able to read those glorious paragraphs. Like, I\u2019m a different person after experiencing Chapter 26. When I\u2019m sad or hurt or angry, I\u2019m going to reread Chapter 26 so I know the true meaning of this life.\n\n\u201c\u2026like taking a dare to run over knives, like an adrenaline strike of lighting, like the moment when you\u2019ve swum too far out in the sea and there is no going back, only cold black water closing over your head.\u201d\n\nAlso, fair warning, this book has a cliffhanger ending that puts all other cliffhanger endings to shame. Just typing that sentence gave me full body goosebumps, by the way! Oh, and the title of this book is absolute perfection, as well. This book has touched me in a way that very few books have in my life. This is the type of book that reminds me why I fell in love with reading in the first place. This is the type of book that makes me believe words have the most powerful healing magic of anything in this world. This is the type of book that completely sets my soul on fire and makes me feel utterly enchanted. I just know that The Cruel Prince is a once in a lifetime series, because this first installment was everything I have ever wanted in a book.Holly Black immerses me, captivates me, and makes me believe in magic. I have no words of gratitude for that, and I\u2019m not sure what the world has done to deserve her stories, but I will forever be grateful. Holly Black helps me forget all the actual cruel princes in our world today, and their terrible choices that they are making for all of us. And honestly, I\u2019d be super surprised if she isn\u2019t an actual fae queen, that just escaped faerie to torture us with real stories that went on while she was ruling. Again, if you can only preorder one book for the rest of the year, please pick The Cruel Prince by Holly Black. It\u2019s not only my favorite book of the year, it\u2019s one of my favorite books of all time. And then read the rest of Holly Black\u2019s work, because her books are truly the closest thing to magic and each is a tangible vessel of joy that I have an an unconditional amount of love for.\n\n\u201cIf I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.\u201d\n\nBlog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch Content warnings for bullying, talk of suicide, and abuse.

I am mortal.I hate that most of all.\n4 1/2 stars. Over the course of this year, I've read both books that I've liked and books I've disliked. I've read books that I've loved and, it's fair to say, books that are better written, more unique, and more groundbreaking than this book. That being said, however, I am struggling to recall a book that has left me this excited about a YA series in a very long time. It seems like forever since I read a completely juicy YA fantasy with just the right amount of drama, action, surprises, nastiness and the tiniest hints at romantic possibility. The wait for the next book is going to be torture!Holly Black knows her audience so well. She's not kind to us because she knows we don't really want that anyway. So of course The Cruel Prince opens with a brutal murder that leaves Jude, her twin sister Taryn, and their older sister Vivienne at the mercy of the redcap general - Madoc. Jump to ten years later, and the three sisters are all living in Faerie. They've been raised as Madoc's own, more or less, and each is trying to find her own place among the beautiful but cruel, deceitful but always honest, fey.For Vivi, return to the human world is the answer. For Taryn, assimilation and playing by the rules is the only way. For our narrator - Jude - rebellion, bloodshed and winning her place in the King's council is what she desires.\nNicasia's wrong about me. I do not desire to do as well in the tournament as one of the fey. I want to win. I do not yearn to be their equal.In my heart, I yearn to best them.\nIt is extremely compelling. Even before the real drama kicks off in the later chapters, I was so wholly pulled into Jude's world. The bullying she endures at the hands of her fey classmates adds a heavy dose of unfairness to keep you pissed enough to turn the pages. Then we get to the spying, secrets, betrayals, side-switching and, oh wow, can I just have the next book please?In truth, not a single character is entirely likeable. All are complex, more than a little flawed, and nobody can be trusted. Even Jude. It's really quite wonderful. Cardan, the \"cruel prince\" from the title, is an asshole. A drunken, bullying, selfish asshole. And yet... and yet. We shall see.In case it wasn't obvious, I loved it. All the drama is absolutely delicious and, while Black does draw on some familiar tropes, the world, characters and politics feel fresh in her hands. It charges to a climax full of surprises and the ending doesn't disappoint. Nicely wrapped up but with enough to leave me desperate for the next instalment. I can't wait!\n\"Nice things don't happen in storybooks,\" Taryn says. \"Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.\"\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "So, where to begin. Hype as we know it, is quite futile. The buzz it ignites is amazing. They create this excitement within you that has your mind wandering to all of the possibilities and direction the book can go in. Because of the hype, I assumed I would enjoy this book. I'm quite an easy-to-please reader, so usually when a book is hyped up, I tend to enjoy it. Or even if I don't, I will feel indifferent. But this book brought about a rage within me; I hated it with every fibre of my being. You may be thinking that because of the fact I 'succumbed' to the hype, it ruined the experience for me. That was not the case at all. I always go in weary, but with a sense of optimism when it comes to hyped books. As for the book, well, everything was wrong with it for me. Other than the slight addictive quality it had - which died for me after I passed the halfway point - this book was weak in every sense of the word. From the protagonist, to the characters, the plot and the world building. There was no development or growth that brought those aspects to live, not even the writing. The story-line started off quite tragic, with Jude's parents being brutally killed off from the bat. From that, I was expecting some kind of revenge story, or emotionally harrowing character development, because to witness that when you're young will obviously take a toll. But no. That wasn't explored. Right off the bat, our main character goes on to enter some kind of tournament she has no experience in whatsoever. There's nothing ingrained within her to take on this challenge, no power she embodies, intellectually or physically. Whilst it took place, all I kept thinking about was how flimsy the battle was, neither did it feel complete. Just rushed. Thus this was the narrative the story carried on. Our main character had no proper background that we as readers were exposed to in order for us to connect with, no experience, and neither had she trained to gain any of it throughout the course of the book. Everything was just thrown (characters and world) at the reader, and felt as if we were expected to go with the flow and further clarification was not given or explained. Event after event took place with no sense of proper progression of the overall plot. No aspect to it whatsoever felt substantial or concrete. I got angrier as I read on and when it got to the last 50 odd pages, I refused to carry on, because I couldn't bring myself to care one bit. It wasn't that it was even mediocre; the whole book felt pointless to me. INITIAL REACTION REVIEW:Well, I'm pretty sure my soul just died. No, it is dead.I haven't hated a book this much since Caraval and I don't tend to hate books that often. I'm indifferent most of the time, and I do enjoy a lot of the ones I read. But this... god. I have no words.Review to come when I can feel again.Ugh.", "\n\n\n\nIf I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.\n Jude (and her twin, Taryn) are human but their older sister (Vivi) belonged to another world.

The Cruel Prince showcases Holly Black at the top of her game: it is exquisitely dark and delightfully wicked, set in an intricate world of highlighted sensation--the taste of faerie fruit, the feel of rich, decaying fabrics, the smells of dangerous old chambers--and populated by a cast of characters that left me dying from feels.

So many great plot twists and high-intensity, suspenseful moments!TW: murder, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicideHolly Black is truly the queen of creating exquisite worlds. Her interpretation of faeries is always so fascinating and glorious. It\u2019s hard to fully capture what it is about her world-building that is so magical, but her books are always my favorite when it comes to faeries. I believe a part of it is that she flawlessly captures the danger and darkness of fey while also displaying the beauty of their magic. There are few words to accurately describe her talent for writing intriguing and beautiful fantasy worlds.I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Jude is a great protagonist \u2013 her fierceness is complimented by her vulnerability, which makes her very realistic considering her circumstances. The relationships between characters are also fascinating, especially the family dynamics. The way Jude views her sisters and \u201cadoptive\u201d family are very unique in my opinion. I also enjoyed the fact that this is not a romance novel. Though it is weaved in here and there, I feel the overarching plot becomes full of politics as the story progress. I will admit, I did lose focus at sometimes while listening to the audiobook because so much of this novel is centered on political relationships, the complications of monarchies, dynamics between different courts, and plotting to overthrow. That being said, it is so well developed and different from many YA books that I overall had a great experience with in.In total, The Cruel Prince was fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in fantasy, faeries, political intrigue, or just an all-around immersive novel.", "You know a story is good when, at night, before falling asleep, you eagerly replay the story in your mind, but this time with you as the main character living an exciting adventure full of intrigue, danger and romance. It\u2019s one of my preferred ways of falling in the arms of Morpheus. What we have here is Holly Black\u2019s best work if I dare say so myself. I am amazed with this author\u2019s ability to paint scenes of faerie romance, glamour, deception and terror that make your heart pound and stop, pound and stop, pound and stop. I\u2019m glad she experimented so much with the faerie world in the past, because it led her to write this precious book.Holly Black doesn\u2019t reinvent faeries, but she does give them flair. Before I came across her stories, I thought of faeries as annoying little snickering creatures you have to try hard not to step on. But these faeries are\u2026 powerful and sexy. They\u2019re in full control, because the story is set in their territory. This isn\u2019t about faeries invading the human world; it\u2019s about a human girl doing everything she can to gain strength against the creatures who have kept her from having a normal, human childhood.Jude is so flawed it\u2019s beautiful. She doesn\u2019t pretend to be strong, she knows she isn\u2019t. Still, she tries to be and tries harder than anyone else, because she knows her species is at a disadvantage. She lies, she cheats, she kills. There is nothing she isn\u2019t willing to do if it means accomplishing her goals. At the same time, she is not unreasonable and devoid of compassion. I loved her dark side. One element that could have been better is the writing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s very addictive and effective, since it manages to crawl deep into your soul, but the syntax is far from perfect (e.g. Mom screamed. Jude screamed. Taryn and Vivi screamed. Everyone seemed to be screaming, except the tall man. page 5). I\u2019m all for writers taking certain liberties, but this is pushing it. I needed to mention this, because while I do think this book is a great addition to the fantasy genre, I will always value a book with beautiful, well-formed sentences more. Anyhow, read this if you\u2019re in need of a fast-paced, unstoppable adventure. Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "\n\n\"If I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.\" \n\nI see why people call Holly Black 'Queen of the Faeries'. Hoooly wow. What a delightfully dark, twisty novel.If you know anything about me, I'm all about the court politics & intrigue, villains & anti-heroes, and schemes within plots within schemes. This book had my name written ALL over it.Okay so here's the basic rundown without giving away too much. Jude and Taryn are twins. Vivi is their older sister. It turns out, Vivi's real father, Madoc, is fae. When the girls are young, he comes for Vivi, kills their parents, and sees Jude and Taryn as his responsibilities since their mother was his... ex. To put it lightly. He whisks them away to Faerie to be raised alongside his family. Having grown up with Madoc as the only father they knew, Taryn and Jude have come to love him like a father, while Vivi promises to always hate him for what he did.Being the general's daughters, Jude and her sisters are raised alongside the High King's sons and daughters. Each sibling has their own group of friends, spies, etc. Enter Cardan.Cardan is the youngest prince, and on the surface, the cruelest. Anyone who gets in his way, annoys him, or disrespect him, ends up paying dearly. Jude hates him with a passion, to say the least. He has that whole 'school bully' syndrome and is impossibly arrogant (all the makings of a delicious prince, amirite?)Jude just wants to belong. Unlike her sister, she loves the land of Faerie. Her dream is to become a knight. She wants a position of power that will earn her freedom and respect. But after being bullied and harassed by Cardan and his lackeys, Jude is fed up. \n\n\"My good intentions evaporate on the wind. My blood is on fire, boiling in my veins. I do not have much power, but here is what I have - I can force his hand. Cardan might want to hurt me, but I can make him want to hurt me worse.\"\n\nSo we have a bit of a prank war, but a life-threatening one. Jude stops trying to control her temper, and she starts fighting back. She gets in a few good swings at Cardan, which royally pisses him off in the most delightful way. It catches the attention of the rest of the royal family, including Prince Dain. He meets Jude in secret and offers her a position of power if she spies for him. Dain is the chosen son, the one that will inherit the crown via his father's favor. So Jude accepts his offer and becomes part of his 'Court of Shadows'.Political games insue. Jude gets in over her head. (Or does she?)I don't want to say more than that, but that's the general idea of the opening. Only, it becomes so much more. Jude discovers secrets within secrets about the court, and with the coronation coming up, things get especially intense. Not to mention, her twin sister says she has a secret lover but she refuses to reveal his identity. When shit hits the fan, oh man, it gets SO good. The ending was phenomenal, and the sequel is set up to be AMAZING and I dont know how I'm going to wait... *screams into the void*That. Epilogue.Help.Bah, ok. Anyway... Jude is a fantastic main character. She's cunning, witty, and so supremely dark. Perhaps darker than Cardan himself at times. She's complex (so is everyone else) and relatable and easily has one of the strongest voices I've come across in a YA novel. I loved how complicated things get with her sisters and Madoc's family, and how buried some of the secrets are. Oh man. What a cool (and awful) family dynamic. I also looooved how vivid the royal family is. Of course, Cardan is my favorite, because I am utterly helpless when it comes to characters like him. Is there ever something between him and Jude, you ask? I admit nothing, but if you could pass me your fan...Ugh, and the world. Holly Black's writing is lush in every way imaginable, and she excels in bringing such a fantastical world to life. None of it felt made up. She doesn't shy away from anything dark, either. This isn't a pretty fairie land, folks. Here be monsters.My Blog ~ Instagram ~ Twitter ~ Etsy", "while everybody else is happily reading the third book in this series...my full (negative) review of the first book is now POSTED ON MY BLOG! https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...you're welcome?---------------*clears throat*Excuse me, uh. Who cares?This is not a rhetorical question. I truly want to know. I read this whole ass book and I am still at a complete loss for something, anything, to care about. Not a plot point, not a character trait, not a single line of quirky banter I could get myself emotionally invested in.This is a book about fairies and it was a trial for me to get through. Me, a person who loves fairies so much she spent her entire third grade year absolutely convinced, in a non-ironic manner, that she was one. It doesn\u2019t get much more dream audience for this book than me. And I couldn\u2019t give two sh*ts, or one sh*t, or even a fraction of a sh*t, for so much as a moment. So. Who among you was able to pull off such a feat?Okay, to be fair, maybe I\u2019m not the dream audience. Holly Black and I have a rocky past. I grew up on the Spiderwick books (well, mostly the Field Guide, which I used as a means of learning about my own species. See the above \u201cI thought I was a fairy\u201d admission). But The Coldest Girl in Coldtown is one of 9 books I\u2019ve DNFed in my entire goddamn life, and The Darkest Part of the Forest was another snoozefest.I like character-driven stories. I like slow books with beautiful writing. But I don\u2019t like Holly Black characters, and I don\u2019t love Holly Black\u2019s writing, and basically all of her books put me to sleep every time. And also make me feel like I\u2019m reading the exact same book over and over. Seriously, they all read the same. Including Spiderwick, which is shocking because that 1) is middle grade and 2) has a good deal less sexual tension than a lot of her other stuff.Anyway.This book was so, so boring.Nothing really happens until past the 200-page mark, and by then everything is so silly and ridiculous that I was mostly along for the ride. What, you say? More of the synopsis is out the window? We\u2019re just deleting more character development from our brains? Delightful. Because, again, who cares.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Jude. I don\u2019t know why they love Jude. Is she supposedly \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cpowerful\u201d or \u201cbadass\u201d or one of those words we assign to characters when there isn\u2019t much to describe? Because I\u2019m not seeing anything to fall in love with.I know a lot of people love this book because they love Cardan. I know exactly why they love Cardan. It is because he is one of three or four YA boy character archetypes that draw in blatant adoration (and delightful fan art) from readers WITHOUT. FAIL.Basically, here are the acceptable YA male traits. You pick a combination of these, and you have your flat, uninteresting, repeat character.- handsome OR beautiful OR hot- funny OR mysterious OR charming- banter-y OR bully-y OR flirtyAnd that\u2019s it. I often like the handsome/funny/banter-y archetype. From time to time, I\u2019ll enjoy a hot/charming/flirty one. I always, always, always hate the beautiful/mysterious/bully-y one. I hated Will Herondale, and boy oh boy do I hate Cardan. And I know a lot of people love this book because of the plot and the world. But the plot to me was nonexistent, because for 200 pages this book largely made me drag myself through it, with no action or momentum to pull me along. And the world is just Every Holly Black Book But With A Slight Twist, Maybe. And that world hasn\u2019t worked for me since I was nine and thought myself a resident, my dear boy.Bottom line: I guess the thing with Holly Black is that if one book works for you, they all will. But baby, that goes both ways!---------------pre-reviewthis book is...lame.review to come!!!---------------buddy reading this with lily and may and we are definitely all thriving and having a good time. no rage or boredom involved at all---------------just received official word that i WILL be excommunicated from goodreads if i do not have this book on my shelves", "Read 2 | January 2019because one must prepare for an eternity of internal screaming, I reread this before The Wicked King and just let me say: aaaaaaaaaaaa wHY IS IT SO GOOD THOUGH. It is vicious and merciless and gorgeous and bloody and ajdfkslad I don't know what this says about me, but this is my favourite type of book. I really didn't ship Cardan/Jude the first time but I do now. Look at these two completely dysfunctional slytherin darlings go.*:\u00b7\uff9f\u2727*:\u00b7\uff9f\u2727Read 1 | January 2018I CAN'T GET OVER HOW FREAKING BLOODILY FANTASTIC THIS WAS. I WAS GOING TO BE CHILL ABOUT THE WHOLE THING MY LMAO NO. THIS BOOK IS STABBY AND MARVELLOUS AND I WANT 9 MORE.I'm actually reeling okay?! Holly Black has been a favourite of mine for years and I was craving more murderous dark faerie books. This is not about Tinkerbell. This is about the monsters in the woods and enchantments and torture and massacres and conniving. This book is, most definitely, about cruel wit. And I absolutely love it. Although honestly I thought it'd actually be a bit darker? But I probably shouldn't mention that because I can literally see you all throwing salt at me and asking if I was a stolen malicious changeling baby which......yes? I totally see how that could be.Anyway, onwards.+ First off, this is the ultimate Slytherin book.It's really complex and twisty with the fey royalty plots and the conniving courts and the intriguing and the backstabbing and twisted plotting. Like the fey do REALLY well to get around the \"we can't lie\" thing. I have taken notes. Because obviously this is the kind of book you learn from. #NoPleaseDontRunawayFromMeImNiceSometimesImSure But it's CLEVER and complex and I crave that in a book and I got so so much of it.+ And it's fully set IN the fey world.Usually books about fey are more about the overlap, but this is like 98% set in Faerieland! I'M SO FREAKING HAPPY ABOUT THIS. It's saturated in the rich luscious world. The descriptions were gorgeous and just popped off the page. And everything was beautiful and pure deadly. Like hey welcome to my hOME where the fruit will kill you and there are death monsters in the pond and also if you piss off a gentry fey you'll die and also EVERYTHING IS GORGEOUS SO THERE'S THAT! Basically I was so in love with the gorgeous and brutally nasty world.10/10 chances that if I got lured into faerieland I'd be like Jude and stay too. (I can handle the stabbing, ok? Once I even killed a fly.)+ There's plenty of blood and stabbing.Like, mate. We aren't going to muck about. There is MURDER and it's chilling.+ I really loved Jude, our protagonist!She's such a complicated person, born fully human and being fostered by, basically, her parent's murderer (also her human mum's ex husband...look the fey world is complicated). She's been raised in a world where the fey will ALWAYS despise her for her mortality. And the bullying, I think, was done really well and actually quite relatably. I mean, we're in the fey courts, for goodness sakes, but you have a relatable story line of a girl who is never fitting in or accepted because of who she was born + putting up with the cruelness of the other fey kids in her classes. And Jude was just NOT going to be run over. She wasn't overconfident or heartless, but she was badass and terrifying and clever and such a schemer. <3 <3+ There's a lot of emphasis on family too!Although I kind of thought Taryn was a flake and Vivi had little to no point to the story but heyyy sisters!! I do love books with SO many interesting women. Plus Oak was an adorable brat. And I loved how morally grey Madoc was. Like the dude was bad but also good?!? But BAD. Nice.+ I admit I totally feel things about Prince Cardan.He's so nasty and cruel and makes Jude's life miserable...which is 100% the recipe for me to hate him. I do NOT like the \"ooh I like you so I'll be mean to you\" story lines but it wasn't like that! I loved the twists in their interactions, but this isn't the kind of ship you'd expect. It's not even a ship?!?? Is it?!? I DON'T KNOW. (FYI I guessed what was going on with Locke VERY early.) But Cardan was mean and actually a little tragic underneath and I'm desperate to know what happens next.ajfdsklad I didn't mean to care about this boy ajfkdlsad why why + I also really took my time reading and it was worth it!Every page was gorgeous and satisfying and interesting. I can't even with how detailed the world was and how smoothly the plot ran. I LOVED Jude's narration and watching her change from someone struggling not to be walked over, to someone an acorn and a thumbprint away from manipulating the world. Ugh Jude. I love everything about you. + PLUS THE ENDING. HOLY YES.EVERYTHING ABOUT IT MAKES ME DESPERATE FOR BOOK 2. Is it too early to declare a favourite of the year?! Or favourite of ever?!?BASICALLY: READ THIS.If you like dark fey stories and books that aren't afraid to get bloody and girls with swords and clever crafty plots -- this one. This. Eat it. Be entranced. It's terrible and beautiful and everything I was hoping for.", "\u201dFaeries make up for their inability to lie with a panoply of deceptions and cruelties. Twisted words, pranks, omissions, riddles, scandals, not to mention their revenges upon one another for ancient, half-remembered slights. Storms are less fickle than they are, seas less capricious.\u201dAnd this is exactly why I \nLOVED\n this book! I dunno about you but I love my faeries wicked, cunning and cruel and unfortunately not a lot of authors are able to pull that off. Many faerie books are pretty soft and the MCs are like Twilight\u2019s Bella and Edward only that they are faeries instead of vampires. So I\u2019m always beyond excited and more than just a little delighted (oopsie that rhymed again, I can\u2019t hide my faerie heritage after all) when I find a book and an author that actually knows about the true legends and fairy tales. What it comes down to is that Holly Black definitely is one of those mentioned authors! I swear, I didn\u2019t have as much fun reading a faerie book ever since I finished Melika Dannese\u2019s \u201cDeadmarsh Fey\u201d and Melissa Marr\u2019s \u201cWicked Lovely\u201d series. If you don\u2019t know either of those two you better check them out and see if they might be something for you. ;-) I admit they aren\u2019t for everyone because they stick to the facts of legends and myths (especially Melika\u2019s book) but if you\u2019re into well researched books and want something that\u2019s close to the common folk tales but still has its own voice I can totally recommend them. Anyway! After finishing \u201cThe Cruel Prince\u201d I was so satisfied, I felt like I needed the proverbial cigarette after. Since I don\u2019t smoke I settled for a whiskey instead and enjoyed one of those rare silent evenings when you\u2019re able to let your thoughts wander. In the end I can say that I loved all the characters and their duplicity and I\u2019m definitely craving for more! I can\u2019t wait to read \u201cThe Wicked King\u201d soon, but for now you\u2019ll just have to endure one of my long and super spoilery reviews. This is how faeries are done and I\u2019m so going to write an essay about it! *lol* If you want to read my full review you can do it here! The characters:\nYou\u2019re leaving the mortal realm and are now entering Faerie. Keep your friends close to you, don\u2019t accept dance proposals and if any food is offered to you and you take it\u2026 well, then you\u2019re already doomed. XD Spoilers ahead of you. Be my guest! And btw did I mention that it would be a pleasure to dance with you? *offers hand* ;-P\nJude:\u201dNo matter how careful I am, eventually I\u2019ll make another misstep. I am weak. I am fragile. I am mortal. I hate that most of all. Even if, by some miracle, I could be better than them, I will never be one of them.\u201dAhhh now Jude is what I call a driven character! That girl\u2019s on fire and no matter what kind of obstacle is in her way she\u2019s ready to take it up with the entire world. I kinda like her for it. *lol* I mean she\u2019s very self-conscious, she knows her limits and that she\u2019ll never become one of the faeries she lives with but she\u2019s still sort of brave and reckless. Just because she\u2019s a human and weak in comparison to all the others this doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019ll back down. Jude might be human but she won\u2019t allow her weaknesses to define her and that\u2019s amazing! I know many people might think that she\u2019s dumb for even trying and that she should keep her head down just like her twin sister Taryn, but if you\u2019re constantly being picked at there comes a point where you can\u2019t and won\u2019t take it any longer. I loved that Jude is courageous enough to take that extra step, to do what no one expects her to do and to laugh in their faces even if they are trying to push her down. Is it dangerous? You bet it is. Was it fun to watch Jude dish out retaliation to those obnoxious faeries? HELL YES!!! I adore my cunning and determined baby and I can\u2019t wait to see what she\u2019s going to do next. XD\u201dI am going to keep on defying you. I am going to shame you with my defiance. You remind me that I am a mere mortal and you are a prince of Faerie. Well, let me remind you that means you have much to lose and I have nothing.\u201d\u201dWhat could I become if I stopped worrying about death, about pain, about anything? If I stopped trying to belong? Instead of being afraid, I could become something to fear.\u201d\u201dIf I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.\u201dLocke:\u201dThere is pleasure in being with them,\u201d he says. \u201cTaking what we wish, indulging in every terrible thought. There\u2019s safety in being awful.\u201d Now that\u2019s a character that had me yelling at the pages, in a good way of course. ;-) Haha! I can\u2019t believe that none of them realized how dangerous Locke truly is! I never bought into his \u201clonely boy\u201d fa\u00e7ade and if you ask me that one is going to be big, big trouble in book two. He might have taken a backseat in \u201cThe Cruel Prince\u201d at the ending but that was only because he enjoyed \u201cwatching the story unfold\u201d. XD Locke is a perfect example of a trickster and his story, well, it\u2019s not over yet. Not by a long shot! And tell you what? I can\u2019t wait to see what that wicked young faerie is going to do next. *lol* He might have fooled Jude once but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s on guard now and knowing her she won\u2019t let him off the hook so easily. He\u2019s most certainly prepared for her revenge though so Cardan and Jude better tread carefully around him. ;-) That boy\u2019s got skill and he\u2019ll use every little bit of it to get what he craves and wants. I guess he already proved that he has absolutely no qualms about playing unfair. XD\u201dI like for things to happen, for stories to unfold. And if I can\u2019t find a good enough story, I make one.\u201d He looks every inch the trickster in that moment.Cardan:\u201dAnd Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest, with black hair as iridescent as a raven\u2019s wing and cheekbones sharp enough to cut out a girl\u2019s heart.\u201dOkay, let me get it down on this page: I LOVED Cardan that little **** (insert swear word of your choice here)! *lol* GAH! I didn\u2019t see such an arrogant and obnoxious character ever since I finished Melissa Marr\u2019s series. Cardan is so cocksure of himself that it was a pleasure to watch him in action. Like seriously! That boy!!! All tough and mean on the outside but once you see beyond that he\u2019s vulnerable af! <3 What was really curious about him was that he has a tail! XD No one ever mentioned that in the reviews I read and I loved how it was implied that he hides it because it\u2019s giving away his feelings. If there was one thing I didn\u2019t like then it was that he wasn\u2019t an all too big part of the story. I would have loved to see more of him and I really hope that Holly Black will do me that favour in \u201cThe Wicked King\u201d. There are so many sides of his character I didn\u2019t see yet and I want to explore them layer by layer! (Double meaning totally intended here! *lol*)\u201dDo you know what mortal means? It means born to die. It means deserving of death. That\u2019s what you are, what defines you \u2013 dying. And yet here you stand, determined to oppose me even as you rot away from the inside out, you corrupt, corrosive mortal creature. Tell me how that is. Do you really think you can win against me? Against a prince of Faerie?\u201d\u201dYou are terrifying. Nearly my whole family is dead, and while they never had much love for me, I don\u2019t want to join them. I\u2019ve spent all night worrying what you\u2019re going to do, and I know exactly what I deserve. I have a reason to be nervous.\u201dVivi:\u201dI think it broke Vivi\u2019s heart to return, but she did it. And she stayed. Whatever else I can say about Vivi, when it really mattered, she stuck by us.\u201dWhy did no one ever mention that Jude and Taryn have a big sister?! I was like: WHAT?! when I started to read the book and the fact that she has a mortal girlfriend was even more intriguing! I mean yes, Vivi is a side-character but she\u2019s a pretty cool one and seems to have her heart in the right place. I like her way more than I like Taryn and I wish Holly Black would have taken more time to flesh her out. So far all we know is that she\u2019s a rebel, kind and wants to live in the mortal world, which isn\u2019t an awful lot if you ask me. I really hope that\u2019s going to change in book two though! =) Vivienne shrugs, and I am reminded of how, despite her being my sister, we differ in ways that are hard to comprehend. \u201cYou did a brave thing. Be glad of that. Not everyone can be brave. I\u2019m not always.\u201dThe relationships and ships:Jude & Locke:\u201dI brace myself for more scorn, but then one corner of his mouth lifts. He winks, as if in acknowledgement of being caught out. As if we\u2019re sharing a secret. As if he thinks I am not loathly, as though he does not find my mortality contagious.\u201dALL of my faerie instincts screamed \u201cHELL NO!!!\u201d when Locke started to show interest in Jude and as it seems I was right. I\u2019ve to admit that I have a lot of respect for Locke though. I mean that boy managed to seduce and confuse Jude big time and this even though she\u2019s so distrustful and basically only sees the bad in every faerie. That\u2019s quite an achievement and one of the main reasons I love Locke. He\u2019s a manipulative, conniving and intelligent bastard and their relationship was nothing but cold-blooded calculation. Ahh how I admire that kind of ambition. *lol* Anyway, we all know that Jude will do everything possible to settle that score so Ha! You better wrap up warmly, Locke and Taryn. There\u2019s an ice storm coming right your way. ;-P \u201dIt takes us a long time to wend our way back down the stairs. My hands are in his hair. His mouth is on my neck. My back is against the ancient stone wall. Everything is slow and perfect and makes no sense at all. This can\u2019t be my life. This feels nothing like my life.\u201d\u201dDo you love me enough to give me up?\u201d I am sure my expression is stricken. He leans closer. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a test of love?\u201dJude & Taryn:\u201dYou think I\u2019m weak.\u201d\u201cYou are weak,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou\u2019re weak and pathetic and I \u2013\u201c\u201cI\u2019m a mirror,\u201d she shouts. \u201cI\u2019m the mirror you don\u2019t want to look at.\u201dWell, if Taryn isn\u2019t a two-faced snake then I dunno. There\u2019s Jude trying to save her na\u00efve and stupid sister, just to find out that our young and innocent girl is anything but! I knew there was something up with her and Locke and I was not surprised to find out the truth. Unfortunately this can\u2019t be said about Jude and I\u2019m pretty sure Taryn just gambled her only chance to win the award for \u201cbest twin sister\u201d. Not that she ever stood a chance to get it. I mean she always let Jude struggle on her own, she never helped her, never tried to defend her, she just let those faeries do what they wanted and if Taryn would have been my sister I would have broken with her a long time ago. Guess Jude got to that point now as well. >_<Jude & Cardan:\u201dI hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.\u201d I ship them. HARD!!! I loved those two! This kind of hate-love is so damn intriguing I can\u2019t even! It\u2019s so rare to see it on page and boy did Holly Black surpass herself! There are those two people that hate each other so much that they want to kill each other yet at the same time they have this incredible attraction and can\u2019t seem to be able to fight it. I\u2019ll only say it once but: YAS!!!! This is the supreme discipline of a love-hate relationship and if it continues to be that good in book two I\u2019ll be in seventh heaven and will savour every second! It\u2019s obvious they want each other but whilst it was pretty evident that Jude hated Cardan more than he hated her, the same can\u2019t be said for the ending of the book. I think at the end they might have switched roles and I\u2019m more than just certain that Cardan hates Jude with a fierce passion now. She forced him to take over the throne, the one thing he never wanted and he\u2019s bound to her. Ohh damn! This is going to be fun once the one year and one day is over! *lol* But until then we can expect deadly C.H.E.M.I.S.T.R.Y and I\u2019m so ready for it! <333He leans in and closes his eyes. \u201cMost of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It\u2019s disgusting, and I can\u2019t stop.\u201dI\u2019m shocked into silence.\u201cMaybe you should shoot me after all,\u201d he says, covering his face with one long-fingered hand.I fix him with a look. \u201cI can be charming. I charmed you, didn\u2019t I?\u201dHe rolls his eyes. \u201cDo not expect others to share my depraved tastes.\u201d\u201dCardan looks at me with helpless rage. Then, the full minute of my command up, he rises slowly to his feet. The fury in his eyes is familiar, the glitter of them like banked fire, like coals burning hotter than flames ever could. This time I deserve it. I promised he was going to be able to walk away from the Court and all its manipulations. I promised he would be free from all this. I lied.\u201dCardan & Locke:\u201dEnough,\u201d Locke says sharply to Cardan. He\u2019s got his hands on my shoulders and is pulling me roughly to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m taking her home.\u201d\u201cAre you, now?\u201d Cardan asks him, eyebrows raised. \u201cInteresting timing. You like the savor of a little humiliation, just not too much?\u201d\u201cI hate it when you get like this.\u201d Locke says under his breath.Okay, seriously. What is it with those two? *lol* There is something between them and I just can\u2019t put my finger on it! Judging by Cardan\u2019s comment Locke didn\u2019t try anything with him yet, but I think Cardan might have a soft spot for Locke? I mean he basically admitted that he\u2019s insulted because Locke never showed any interest in him. XD Is this one-sided? Or is there more to it? Mhmm\u2026 those two are a tough nut to crack but I\u2019ll find out sooner or later! Hopefully \u201cThe Wicked King\u201d will be revealing. If there is actually something I\u2019ve to admit that I\u2019d definitely ship it! *lol* That makes his smile grow. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t. Maybe either of you would have done as his first mortal conquest. I believe his goal is to have both of you in the end.\u201dI don\u2019t like any of this. \u201cWhat about you?\u201dHe gives me a quick, odd look. \u201cLocke hasn\u2019t gotten around to seducing me yet, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. I suppose I should be insulted.\u201dConclusion:I loved everything about this book! From the scheming to the intrigue, from the duplicity to the bitter truth, from lovers to haters and the other way around\u2026 Written down on 370 pages of perfection there was basically everything I crave for in a good faerie book and I really couldn\u2019t be even more delighted than I already am. <3 This book was AMAZING and totally worth the hype! Enough said! ;-)", "\n\"Father, I am what you made me. I've become your daughter after all.\"\n", "4.5/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3a\n\u201c(\u2026) cheekbones sharp enough to cut out a girl\u2019s heart.\u201d\nI love me a cruel and tipsy Faerie prince and that\u2019s Cardan and only Cardan.I mean everything I said in the previous sentence. Every. Word. Is. True.Cardan was the best thing happening to this book and if you deny this that that\u2019s strictly your problem. He\u2019s a charmer.*I don\u2019t read hyper-hyped books in general. But when I do, I read them aeons after they\u2019re out so the hype has worn out and I can enjoy the book (or not) in peace. This one was super hyped. I was plainly curious to see if it really is worth a shot.I truly didn\u2019t expect the beginning of the book to scream like that. That was a power move. And I liked it.Everything that came after that was to lure us into the Faerie world, of what, I must admit, I have only a minimum knowledge of. Everyone is beautiful, but everyone is cruel. Basically, it looks like a circus.It is important for me to be able to grasp the world from the beginning. I feel frustrated when the whole universe unravels as if I just dropped in the middle of what was going on and no one had the time to acknowledge me. I want to feel important from the beginning.Thank you, Holly Black, I did feel important!\n\u201cBeing born mortal is like being born already dead.\u201d\nThis is the story of sisters. Vivienne, Jude and Taryn are three sisters who began their lives in the mortal world and but then were forced to come to Elfhame after their parents got brutally murdered by their soon-to-be foster father \u2013 Vivienne\u2019s real father. Vivi is one of them; Jude and Taryn, the twins, are not. This is the story of the sisters\u2019 struggle to be accepted in a world that doesn\u2019t want them to be part of.  Although Jude and Taryn are twins, they are completely different from each other. Where Taryn is ladylike and delicate, silent and obedient, Jude is determined and loud and wild. Where Taryn wants to be granted a place in the Faerie world through marriage, Jude wants to be a knight and play at war.The story is narrated from Jude\u2019s point of view. That is probably why many people find her annoying. The whole story sounds like her own roaring thoughts and feelings. Maybe she annoys herself too as many of us get annoyed with ourselves and our own thoughts.\n\u201cYou\u2019re like a story that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\nIn a purely honest note, I kind of liked Jude in this book. Sure, she was a bit annoying sometimes, but truth be said, I liked her better than Taryn. There was something about her twin sister that made me repel her. Jude was interesting in a way that made me relate to her. I could totally see me sometimes in her actions. I felt like she was full of her own personality.She\u2019s power-thirsty. But this is how she was raised to be. To fight, to scheme, to seek and seize power. She\u2019s the foster daughter of the great general of the Faerie after all. I still consider that a badass trait about her. Don\u2019t you think?Now, as I previously stated, I think I might have a soft spot for Cardan, the youngest Prince of the Faerie.\n\u201cThere\u2019s safety in being awful.\u201d\nCardan Greenbriar might seem cruel, reckless, thirsty for violence, but I think he is totally the good boy in disguise type. I mean, at first, I couldn\u2019t stand him (even though I hated his friends more than I despised him). Then, there was this period of transition where I had mixed feelings about him. 65% in and I just slowly but steadily started to fall in love with him. I started to realise things about him as presented by his actual, intimate actions. And how couldn\u2019t I fall like a fool? He was a lonely and broken boy. All he wanted was to love and be loved, but no one seemed to care about him enough to grant him that little. What is the whole power in the world of Faerie without an ounce of affection to it?\n\u201cMost of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It\u2019s disgusting and I can\u2019t stop.\u201d\nHe hates. Hates because he loves. Hate because he\u2019s not loved.His relationship with Jude starts and unfolds slowly. They have that wonderful love-to-hate relationship that I actually enjoy in books in general.I consider their relationship a bit unhealthy though. What happens between the two of them is a peculiar kind of hate-love. It\u2019s a game played out of spite. It\u2019s all about power and desire. I am not sure this is right, but I do believe that this type of relationship is going to improve because from hate to love to hate to love again \u2013 that\u2019s an endless wheel that could be stopped anytime, anywhere. One can make a beautiful thing out of something hideous, but one can also ruin the beauty of a thing. Their relationship, in this book, is dangerous ground.Indeed, something about the book seemed off. Even though the world-building was very good and the action was fantastic, the depth of the characters was somehow missing. I wanted them to be more individualised, but I think that\u2019s just because we see the story through only one character\u2019s point of view. When you personalise the action, it\u2019s hard to create well-developed individuals.That, I think, it\u2019s the only contradictory thing I have to say about this book. Really. I even enjoyed all the bloodshed there. And that\u2019s not okay. But it was so cleverly crafted that I just had to enjoy it somehow??(x)", "Well, despite marking this as \"currently reading\" (I put books there that I plan to read within the next week or two) I finally cracked this bad boy open today...and finished it in one three-hour siting.So, if that's not an indication of something being a seriously above average read, I don't know what is. Jude was a really edgy, imperfect, relatable character and I really liked her. So often, I want characters to do something - maybe say something or do something I want them to do in a specific moment - and I am left feeling frustrated and annoyed when they don't. They DON'T deliver the nasty comeback I feel someone so amazingly deserves. They DON'T punch the face of the asshole who has done them wrong.They DON'T say \"fuck you\" to the person who just betrayed them. But, Jude?Home girl DID all of those things and more and I loved it. She saw that proverbial high road on some occasions, the one other characters sometimes begged her to take and she said:Get it, girl. On top of that, the plot here was pretty well thought out and I enjoyed the twists and turns, none of which felt convenient or trite. It will definitely be interesting to see what happens with the plot and certain character relationships in the next book. The wait will be long. Oh and PS...fuck you, Taryn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "some books are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. this book is all of the above. my mind simply cannot comprehend what i just read because its greatness transcends human understanding. what a blessed world we live in where this kind of greatness exists for us mere mortals. i cant even fathom what sort of perfection \u2018the wicked king\u2019 will be. the last half of this book is one of the best build-ups to a sequel i have ever read. like, are you kidding me!? holly black is not of this world and this book is proof. very much looking forward to the further greatness of this series! \u21a0 4.5 stars", "I already knew it was coming but here is my Fairyloot box =) Clink link below pic to see about the items!

She gets dragged away with her two sisters to Faerie by the man that killed her parents. Lives in Faerie most of her life. Is training to fight and can handle a sword very well. She wants to be a Knight but she turns into so many other things. She takes bullying every day and doesn't let them get her down. You go girl! She plots and plans and gets it done!!!!! Well, this is only the first book. We have to see how she can handle it all in the next book/s. I love some of the side characters in this book; The Bomb, Roach, The Ghost. I love Bomb the most. She's awesome, hence her nickname. We have little Oak who is the little brother. Madoc who is an off and on jerk. Oriana who is an off and on jerk. Prince Dain who I never trusted to begin with and Locke who I never trusted to begin with either. Prince Cardan is a jerk face too. But, he has his reasons. There are more peeps -er-faeries that are jerks in the book but it's pretty common. Lol Anyhoo, I loved it and I'm glad because I own 3 copies of the book in all the beautiful covers =DHappy Reading! Mel \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListAMAZON: REVIEW", "Brace yourselves, folks, we're jumping on the hype wagon!\n\n\u201cIf I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.\u201d \n\n\nFirst Stop: Elfhame\nWith all the raving reviews about The Cruel Prince, how could little ol' Katerina resist? The Hype (yes, Hype with a capital H because it's a being of its own that swallows the innocent and the weak) was a siren, luring me to dive into its dark waters, and, thankfully, I was not eaten alive. With a successful blend of modern world and faerie lore, Holly Black created a dangerous and mesmerizing tale, a gripping saga focused on intrigue, schemes and backstabbings. Jude was seven years old when a cruel fae showed up on her doorstep, murdering her parents and taking her and her sisters to the realm of the Immortals, a realm so beautiful and imposing that hid how rotten and tainted it was on the inside. Despite her best efforts, Jude was always humiliated and taunted, a worm daring to live and train among their perfect kin. And her greatest tormentor? Prince Cardan and his band of merry evil men minions. With the coronation of the next king approaching, Jude found her opportunity to shine, to grab a place for herself and hold it with her bleeding hands. But with plots set into motion, and disorienting deceptions, maybe finding her place means giving up the little humanity that's still left in her.\n\n\u201cBecause you're like a story that hasn't happened yet. Because I want to see what you will do. I want to be part of the unfolding of the tale.\u201d \n\n\nNext stop: Lake of Backstabbing\nPeople who compare The Cruel Prince to Game of Thrones are not exaggerating. The conspiracies, the hidden agendas, and the masterful way they unfold manage to keep you at the edge of your seat thoughout the story, you sweat and sweat and wonder who has the upper hand and who is going to perish, whose blood is going to spill, who is the good guy and who the villain (well, in all honesty all of them are the villains but a girl can hope, right?), and you can't help but feel a rush of adrenaline each time those horrible creatures plot and stab and spy and then plot some more. And when all this plotting and stabbing and spying takes place in idyllic landscapes, manors and balls, you can understand why I'm such a goner.\nNext stop: Temple of Hate\nA curious thing happened with The Cruel Prince; I didn't like the main characters. At all. Was I fascinated? Of course, they were beautiful and monstrous, and that combination sparked a flare of curiosity to see how their stories will play out, but come on, they're horrible! (expect Vivi, you go girl!)Beneath her frail mortal body and her too-short lifespan, Jude was a hungry, ruthless beast craving power, scheming, betraying, and wanting with a fiery need to become one the creatures that tortured her and rejected her. I was rooting for her to an extent, if only to teach those awful fae that expendable humans can outmaneuver them, but she really needs to calm down, this hunger consumed her thoughts and didn't leave place for other, more pleasant sentiments. Don't get me started on her parade of stupid decisions. And Cardan was not better. Fine YES I had a tiny crush on him (thumbs up for dark jerks who hide their pain), but that doesn't erase the fact that he's cruel, irresponsible and petty, a true bully. Madoc, Locke, Dain, Taryn, they were hideous, but let me tell you this, that is not a bad thing. Sure, I didn't particularly connect with them, but this detachment liberated me from the usual fear for their lives, or sorrow for their misfortunes, only the occassional anger and disgust. I was invested in their story and not in them, but somehow this magnified the reading experience! I was there for the bumpy ride, for the malice and the power bid, I sank my teeth into their rotten fruit and was bewitched by their depravity. \n\n\u201cThere's always something left to lose.\u201d \n\n\nTerminal station: Vale of Fangirling\nThe Cruel Prince was a beguiling, wicked tale of power, lust, secrets and magic. The world Holly Black painted, with her lush descriptions, the revels and the colourful creatures that came straight out of a storybook is a place worth visiting, and cherishing. Drunk on enchanted wine, exhausted from dancing in fancy dresses until my foot hurt, clammy from the swordfights but deliciously invigorated, I am all too eager to return to Elfhame and be a part of the High Court!You can find this review and more on BookNest!", "\u201cNice things don\u2019t happen in storybooks. Or when they do happen, something bad happens next. Because otherwise the story would be boring, and no one would read it.\u201dPERFECT. This book is PERFECT. So\u2026BUCKLE UP! \u2018CAUSE YOU\u2019RE IN FOR A WILD RIDE!Holly Black, you are going to be the DEATH of me! I loved the Spiderwick Chronicles as a child (so cute!), mildly enjoyed the Modern Faerie Tale series (kinda cringey, not gonna lie :-/), appreciated The Darkest Part of the Forest (so much faery tale-esque whimsy!), tolerated the Coldest Girl in Coldtown (vampires are pass\u00e9, okay?), and adored the Curse Workers trilogy (a magical mafia, need I say any more?!)\u2026but the Folk in the Air trilogy is on a WHOLE \u2018NOTHER LEVEL!!! Authors\u2019 writing obviously improve over time. That\u2019s a given. But Holly Black practically did a 180\u00b0 from her d\u00e9but, Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale, to this release, The Cruel Prince. Both involve faeries, which Holly is known for as the Queen of the Faeries in YA literature (Yes, she predates Sarah J Maas, having practically kick-started the faerie obsession in YA in 2002), but the similarities end there. My goodness, THIS BOOK! The plot, the characters, the world, the romance, the political intrigue, the faery lore\u2026anything you could possibly want from a novel is HERE! WELCOME TO FAERIE.\u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is this: Yes, they frighten me, but I have always been scared, since the day I got here. I was raised by the man who murdered my parents, reared in a land of monsters. I live with that fear, let it settle into my bones, and ignore it. If I didn\u2019t pretend not to be scared, I would hide under my owl-down coverlets in Madoc\u2019s estate forever. I would lie there and scream until there was nothing left of me. I refuse to do that. I will not do that.\u201dPersonally, part of my enjoyment of this book has to do with the unpredictability of the storyline itself, so I\u2019ll be brief in terms of the plot. The prologue begins with your modern American mortal family: a mum, a dad, an older sister, and a younger set of twins. Lo and behold, a redcap faery, General Madoc, shows up, slaughters the parents, and takes the children back with him to Faerie. The older sister also happens to be Madoc\u2019s biological daughter, making her half-faery. Fast forward a few years and the children have been reared as Gentry faery children, without truly belonging there. The older sister, Vivienne, longs to return to the mortal realm and disavow everything that makes her a faery. The twins on the other hand, Jude and Taryn, seek to find their places among their faery peers. They want to belong, despite not being faeries themselves. In fact, they are constantly bullied by Prince Cardan and his friends, Locke, Nicasia, and Valerian, but that doesn't deter them. Taryn wants to belong by marriage and Jude wants to belong by knighthood. The real question remains\u2026just how far are they willing to go, in order to finally gain their rightful place in Faerie?\u201cIf I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.\u201dJude Duarte has sky-rocketed to my top 10 list of favourite protagonists. She\u2019s definitely no Mary Sue with her swordsmanship skills and political strategising! At Holly Black\u2019s book signing for The Wicked King, she stated that she intended for Jude to be the female version of the antihero with a tragic backstory trope, you know, with her parents being murdered before her eyes and being bullied throughout those crucial childhood development years. As a result, Jude begins to become very violent and makes some pretty unhealthy choices. She starts fighting back by challenging people to duels and then it\u2019s all downhill from there. It\u2019s at this point that we witness Jude\u2019s descent from your run-of-the-mill YA protagonist to an utterly ruthless antiheroine. Her childhood bully, Prince Cardan, even explicitly recognises how \u201cterrifying\u201d Jude has become. She wants what she wants and she doesn\u2019t care what she has to do or who she has to step on in order to get it\u2026and THAT I RESPECT! \u201cFather, I am what you made me. I\u2019ve become your daughter after all.\u201dOne of my favourite relationships is, funnily enough, the one between Jude and her foster father, Madoc. She might inherently hate him, as he is the murderer of her parents, but she is also, slowly but surely, turning into his mirror! Of all of his children, she is only one as enthused about duels, swordsmanship, and strategy as he is. In all honesty, I looked forward to all of his interactions with her because you could see how much he genuinely does love his girls, even if two of them aren\u2019t biologically his. When he hears of the bullying that Jude endures, he\u2019s basically ready to kill whomever hurt her. What a great, if slightly bloodthirsty, dad! Gah! I love them SO MUCH! This is a perfectly morally grey familial bond, and I am so grateful to Holly for actually including parental figures in this trilogy. They always tend to conveniently disappear in YA literature, for some reason. *shrugs* I hope that we see just as much, if not more, scenes with the two of them in the next instalment! \u201cMost of all, I hate you because I think of you. Often. It's disgusting, and I can't stop.\u201dCardan. Oh, Cardan. Just where do I begin? ;) When we first encounter Cardan, he is nothing more than a common bully. But then, as the novel develops and the plot thickens, we begin to see that there is MUCH MORE beneath the surface. Cardan, in comparison with Jude, is only KIND OF terrible. Jude, on the other hand, surpasses him completely. He makes the appearance of being terrifying, whereas Jude actually IS. In addition, he, like Jude, is rather tragic, as well. He has an awful home life, is perpetually drunk on wine, and is completely unable to cope with his feelings for Jude. Needless to say, their sexual tension was so hot that I\u2019m surprised that the pages of my book didn\u2019t catch on fire. They take the enemies-to-lovers trope to new heights, and I thought Magnus and Cleo from Falling Kingdoms had sexual magnetism! Oof! Never have I been so invested in a YA ship before. But I am ALL ABOARD for #Jardan!!! There better be more kissy-kissy scenes in the next book, or I shall confront Holly with ALL of my grievances!!! As is the case with most of Holly\u2019s novels, we were blessed with quite a few cameos from her previous books! My favourite, of course, being my faery crush, Roiben. What a sexy faery\u2026sigh. If only Kaye would let me have him. That\u2019d be the dream! :D\u201cI have lied and I have betrayed and I have triumphed. If only there was someone to congratulate me.\u201dI\u2019m not even going to discuss Locke and Taryn. Those pathetic wastes of space don\u2019t even deserve the energy that I\u2019ll use to type. They deserve each other and I hope that they\u2019ll be completely miserable for the rest of their sorry lives!So\u2026I\u2019m going to go and read The Wicked King now. And then I shall mourn the fact that I have to essentially wait two years for the finale of this AMAZING trilogy! I\u2019m not even going to bother recommending this series. Anyone who hasn\u2019t read it should just feel ashamed of themselves and go remedy that IMMEDIATELY!", "me reading the folk of the air trilogy in a day *spoilers*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLg5D...hi i'm chandler and this is my favorite book of all timeno for real, this book has EVERYTHING. but first off i just want to say that y'all have been SLEEPING on holly black. she is incredible and i genuinely love every single one of her books that i have read. so i guess it's not surprising that i loved this one. what did i love you may ask?- the writing... HELLO! YES! how can a book that is short and straight forward in writing pack such a big punch. this is no SJM, overly complicated and long bullshit. holly black writes with intention.- the family... the theme of family in this was amazing. jude's relationship with madoc and her sisters was so realistic and nuanced that i felt like it could have existed in real life. i loved it.- the world... somehow it slipped past me in the description of this book but this is set in present day. there are malls and mcdonalds in the human world. how fucking cool is that??? super cool juxtaposition with the seemingly antiquated fae world.- jude... sweetie. you are awesome. you are a bad ass. your feelings are so fcking valid. also the way her feelings about cardan are described in this book... perfection. i seriously related to her which is rare. why are females in books so damn annoying usually? idk but jude IS NOT.- CARDAN... i mean do i really have to explain this one? he's perfect. (but i will say, dunno what y'all are talking about with him secretly being a soft boy... he is NOT. he's a dick, and i love him) if you love yourself, go read this book.", "\n\nIf you hurt me, I wouldn't cry. I would hurt you back.\n\nUm, then why didn't you, Jude? I think I need to get it out of the way: YA fantasy is not suited for me anymore. I've made a quite very easy choice of letting go of the genre slowly. Although I'm no longer going to be checking out YA fantasy from my library, I'm still planning on reading and finishing the ones I own and then donating them to my library, the book store there, and some donation centers in my city.Before starting this review, I had thought about what I would have to say that hasn't been said, and I also thought if I should even say anything. The Cruel Prince has got to be the most hyped up book I've encountered as of now, and I can't say I feel the same about it like everyone else. I think the biggest problem is that I'm no longer such a fan of YA fantasy that it's gotten to the point where I don't even wanna read these type of books anymore, but it's also because I kind of knew what I was getting myself into. I had already been familiar with the characters, the plot, and the ending. Like many others say, this is my opinion, and everyone and anyone is entitled to their own opinion. I\u2019ve said this numerous times, but I actually enjoy seeing other people love books I didn\u2019t enjoy at all. It\u2019s nice seeing a book I didn\u2019t praise be praised. With that being said, please don\u2019t attack me. Sometimes I read to better myself and sometimes I read for pure fun and I rate books based off enjoyment, and in this case, I didn\u2019t enjoy the book at all. Like I said, if you enjoyed this book, great, if you didn\u2019t, cool! If you don\u2019t agree with anything I said, well, I\u2019m sorry, but not every book is written for everyone. At least I gave it a shot.Anyways.I said in an update this book was binge-worthy, and by that, I meant I wanted to finish it in one sitting. Everything was going so well, until Holly Black decided to just throw in everything as if I knew every little detail of Jude's background and of every other character; as if I just somehow knew how and why Jude was so eager to enter this tournament we had never heard about until she mentioned it; as if I knew what Jude really did after she was taken from the mortal world into Fairie.\n\nYou're no killer.He has no idea what I am.\n\nShe may not be a killer, but Jude is used to keeping her head down and her lips shut, used to accepting her flawed mortality, and used to being treated as nothing but a mortal who has no place in Faerie, being told she has nothing to lose because of what she has never earned. Having had to endure it for 10 years after witnessing her parents murdered and being taken to a world she had never heard of and had never thought she would consider her home, Jude is tired of not being seen as no one and nothing but a mere human who should follow the rules. But Jude thinks and acts differently, and she's no longer the seven-year-old girl she was when she and her two sisters were taken by a general whom she now refers to as her dad at times. Jude wants to prove herself worthy for a place in the court, Jude knows she has to accept the consequences she will begin facing if she does not listen and give up. Used to being isolated, unwanted and seen as useless, she begins tasting the true taste of darkness. She sees through the tunnels she had never walked through. She becomes the human girl the fey never thought would fight back. She's not like her twin sister, always following the rules and thinking that's the best choice, and she isn't like her half-blood older sister, Vivi, who wants to return back to the mortal world. Instead, Jude wants to become the human girl the fey never thought would fight back. I honestly thought Jude would end up getting herself a place in the court, but she got stuck in her own mess.I'm honestly just confused. Not at the book, but at myself. Majority of the time, I end up disliking very hyped up books while I end up loving very underrated books, so I don\u2019t even know why I bother keep trying. It feels as if these hyped books should be read by me before they actually become hyped, which is never the case because I had bad habits of reading books that will soon become movies or tv shows or I end up reading books after the sequel is released and has taken over all the hype the first book received.I wanted to love Jude and root for her from the bottom of my heart. After she had to witness her parents be murdered, I expected her to grow from it and teach herself ways to defend herself, but Jude, instead, let her weakness get to her and didn't grow as a character at all. Like other novels and even similar ones, the protagonist sometimes says she will get revenge, whether it's for her or for who she's avenging, but Jude was none of that. She wanted revenge for herself and wanted to earn herself a high place in the court, but that never happened. It's as if the author had made her strong at first but then decided to throw every obstacle to make her weak. At times, she even reminded of Kate from This Savage Song. Both characters had started off strong in a way where they didn't take anyone's bullshit, but then they ended up getting too caught up on the own web they started and it's as if they got too strangled to the point where they couldn't escape from it.I didn't mind Jude calling Madoc her dad at times, but it was annoying how she would refer to him as her father and the next day, she would say she isn't his daughter while saying she is the next day. She asked him for permission for certain stuff, wanted him to accept her, train her, help her, but then she would remind him that she actually isn't her daughter, even if he raised her and has provided her with everything she has needed. Adding on to that, he's the only reason she's \"strong and able to defend herself with the knife she carries\" because, after all, she didn't train herself. Unlike Jude, there wasn't a moment where I ended up supporting Cardan or rooted for him. I really wished Jude would have killed him or made his life miserable. Instead, she ended up helping him and then realizing she actually fucked up. Typical of her though, to realize her dumb mistakes after they're done because of how obviously fucked up they are.One of the biggest problems I had with Cardan was his personality. Apparently, he's charming and sarcastic, but I feel like the sarcasm is so natural that it's just part of his attitude and instead of charming, he's an actual douchebag. He makes Jude's life miserable and uses his past as an excuse to being a dick to Jude. Seeing that he can't redeem himself from the misery he had to live through, he uses them as his power in order to get what he wants. Personally, I didn't find it attractive and I just couldn't accept his reasons as justifications for his actions.  I constantly saw reviews praising Cardan and saying how Cardan shouldn't be blamed for his actions because of how he had to live and what he had to put through. For example, he was beaten up by his brother, his father hated him and his whole existence, no one helped him in any way, and he was never loved by anyone, so in order to put up with it, he would get drunk on wine, push little boys who didn't bow at him, and would have a group of friends who had a love for violence, dramatics, and power. So many people sympathized with him that I feel like I'm either heartless or just don't get the memo here. The whole I was also hurt so I'm going to hurt you too idea can be sympathetic to me even if it isn't done right. I mean, I haven't read enough fantasy books with morally questionable characters who are cruel and ruthless, so maybe that has a connection with this and how I'm one of the only people out there who does not feel bad for Cardan one bit. All in all, I feel like you either like Cardan or you just straight up hate him.\n\nInstead of being afraid, I will become something to fear.\n\nThat all just became true in the ending, but throughout the whole book, Jude would constantly say she will never want to be one of the fey and that they have no idea who she really is, for she is not just any human girl getting in people's business as if it was hers. It got to the point where very time Jude described herself as strong, ruthless, or as anyone who is capable of doing so much, I ended up visualizing her as the typical female protagonists we always read about in YA fantasy. Those female leads who pretend to be strong but in reality, they still walk with their weakness on their shoulders, giving them all the weight which is why they fall down so much and are incapable of getting up. In reality, that never happened, but she felt like that, like a character who carried so much weight that it dragged her.Moving on, I'm also confused about the enemies to lovers trope. I'm simply confused even more as to why that trope is being used. I can see the enemies, but the lovers? Uh, not so much. I see them more as puppets for each other instead, both getting in each other's head to the point where they despise each other but then end up letting themselves be controlled at the same time.I mean, I haven't read a lot of enemies-to-lovers type of books, but I don't mind the trope being a main plot device in the book, as long as it's actually . . . the plot device.Oh right, we also have Taryn, who I hated. There isn't anything good I can say about her, so I'll leave it there.The only character I truly adored was Vivi. I think Vivi was the only one who helped Jude in the best possible way. Not only that, Vivi is bi and wants to go back to the mortal world to be with her human girlfriend AND leave Madoc because Vivi actually kept her promise and the vow she made of hating Madoc forever. Adding on to that, she vowed to hate Madoc, and she never broke that vow, but she also made Madoc so angry and annoyed, it was hilarious. Seeing her carefree when she noticed how annoyed Madoc got when she didn't listen to him made her satisifed. After all, her goal was to annoy him, and she lived up to the promises she made and never went back to it, unlike Jude.Also, I won't even lie, I liked Locke for a while. But then his true identity was revealed and it turns out he was another one of Cardan's puppets who pretended only to control Jude as well. The Cruel Prince was obviously not for me. I think, overall, these hyped up fantasy books are not for me at all. The genre is not for me anymore in general. As I haven't read it for a while, especially a hyped one, it seems as if I had never read it at all. I used to be conflicted about it, but I think now, according to the ratings I've given to the fantasy books I've read, it's probably best I should just let go of it once and for all. Maybe it's because I can truly never connect with the characters in any way, whether it's emotionally or personally. I mean, the last time I read a fantasy with a female lead was in November of 2018. I also think that, sometimes, it's best to stay away from hyped up books or to read them before they get super hyped. Or, maybe, not have any expectations at all because then it all works out and there are no surprises.\n\nWe don't have forever to wait for them to let us do things we want. I don't care if they don't like my being in the tournament. One I become a knight, I'll be beyond reach.\n\nI wish that would have been the case, Jude, but you ended up letting your weakness really get into you that the little hope you had left inside of you was completely forgotten and thrown out the window you were looking at when you imagined yourself as a knight.", "\u201cI have lied and I have betrayed and I have triumphed.\u201dUm yes, I totally gave in to the hype and for once I am glad.After reading The Darkest Part of the Forest, I developed a sudden thirst for more faerie stories and more Holly Black. The Cruel Prince was like a gift from heaven. By the way, if you have only read one of these two books, you might be interested in checking out the other. You might recognise a few characters.This book is like paradise for fans of young adult fantasy. Naturally, I was captivated right from the start. I had no idea where the story was going to go. So many unexpected things were happening, and even though some of them were somewhat predictable, I was caught off guard several times. However, I cannot decide whether I think the plot was chaotic or refreshing. The events in this book could have gone in so many directions. And this book tipped the fine line between a complete mess and a good structure.This might also be related to the main character. I could not get a good feeling for her, as in, her goals and motivations were clearly spelt out, but her voice did not match her actions. On one hand, Jude is this ruthless human with a backbone like a lion, and on the other hand, she is a typical young adult main character that could be interchanged with several other MCs from different novels. I could not make these two aspects fit in one person. I hope she grows into her skin and goes through strong character development in the sequels.Now, the hate-to-love trope is one that I love. It can be so much fun if it is well-written. However, I condemn volatile and unhealthy relationships in novels. That is not romance. It troubles me to see characters that hurt and treat one another in the most despicable ways develope a romantic relationship based on such feelings. This sends a wrong message to the readers. I cannot see such behaviour turned into a pairing and I seriously do not know how this relationship would ever work in the future. I hope Holly Black does not plan a happily ever after for the characters that I have in mind.Other than that, I am so looking forward to The Wicked King. The Cruel Prince was already wicked, thrilling, nerve-wracking and enchanted, and I must admit that I am a little scared to see what will happen next.Find more of my books on Instagram", "#1 The Cruel Prince \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605#2 The Wicked King \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605#3 The Queen of Nothing ??? If I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.It had been years since I\u2019d picked up a Holly Black book, but I loved her writing as a kid, so I was a little bit apprehensive about re-entering her little fae world. Believe me when I say, though, that this book was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. Her writing is impeccable, the lore is woven seamlessly through the tale, the characters are lovable and disastrously grey (which is my favorite, forever), and I just wanted \nmore.\n\n\u201cI promise you this\u201d \u2013 I throw his own words back at him \u2013 \u201cthis is the least of what I can do.\u201d\n\u2192 Jude \u2190I\u2019m going to get this out of the way early: if you asked me what my favorite thing about this book was, I would probably take three years to decide between Holly\u2019s writing voice itself\u2026 or this fantastically grey, authentic, human protagonist. She is angry, terrified, clever, and determined. I\u2019ve heard many people say they thought she was annoying, and while I totally respect everyone\u2019s opinions, I can\u2019t see it \u2013 if anything, she just felt tremendously real to me.\nEven if, by some miracle, I could be better than them, I will never be one of them.\nShe has undergone incredible traumas, and continues to live through daily abuse \u2013 be it verbal or physical \u2013 yet, she manages to shove down her pain and fears for the most part. The fact that she was willing to admit to herself that she was secretly terrified, every moment of every day, made her a three-dimensional character that I could relate to. Despite her fears, she does everything she can to even the playing fields, which I found rather admirable.And then\u2026 that ending? I mean, I won\u2019t spoil, but damn. Jude is more than willing to vilify herself to do what she thinks is best for the people she loves and hopes to protect, and it just made me love her even more than I already did.\nI am coming unraveled. I am coming undone.\n\u2192 Prince Cardan \u2190For all that I loved Jude\u2019s moral greyness, Cardan\u2019s left me feeling conflicted a lot of the time. I feel like I have a little bit of an unpopular opinion in that I wasn\u2019t left swooning for the prince; unfortunately, a lot of his behaviors were borderline unforgivable for me.That said, I do understand that Cardan\u2019s life has been far from easy, and a lot of his behaviors can be somewhat explained (though not justified) by his circumstances. And, I won\u2019t lie, the shift in his attitude towards the end of the book is adorable and far more lovable than his entire existence in the first half of the book, so I still have high hopes that he\u2019ll win me over in the sequel!\nDespite myself, despite what he\u2019d done and what he was, I came to love him. I do love him. It\u2019s just not a comfortable kind of love.\n\u2192 family \u2190Reason #347 why Holly is such a fantastic author: she can make your feelings for a character shift so quickly in one direction or the other, with little to no warning, and Jude\u2019s family is evidence of this from start to finish.\u2022\tMadoc \u2013 Jude\u2019s \u201cfather figure\u201d, who took away her parents only to take her in and raise her. He\u2019s brutal, yet doting, and Jude\u2019s feelings for him were a really interesting and realistic view of Stockholm syndrome, in which she constantly was reminded of the terrible things he had done for her, yet she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself from loving him and wanting to please him. The best part of this is that his character arc is written so flawlessly, I fell for it, too.\u2022\tTaryn \u2014 her twin sister, who ranges from \u201cmeh\u201d to downright infuriating and hate-worthy, depending on which scene you\u2019re reading. (Mostly the latter.)\u2022\tVivienne \u2014 she\u2019s bisexual, rebellious, fun, caring, snarky, and one of my favorite characters in this book by far. I loved each chance that we got to spend time with her, and if there was ever a novella about her life with her cute little mortal girlfriend, I\u2019d be so here for it.\u2022\tOriana \u2014 the other half of Jude\u2019s makeshift parenting duo, who strikes out as aloof and cold, but has a surprisingly love development process throughout the story that made me genuinely hope we see more of her in the future, as I think she could be a valuable ally for Jude in the coming trials.\u2022\tOak \u2014 Oriana\u2019s son, who is tiny, adorable, and wild. He\u2019s the perfect portrayal of Fair Folk in that, despite how lovely and charming he can be, he has a vicious and mischievous streak in his bones that few fae are wholly exempt from.\n \u201cPlenty of mortals are better at plenty of stuff than the Folk. Why do you think we steal them away?\u201d\n\u2192 fair folk \u2190One of the many things I enjoyed about this story is how many side characters there were, and how fleshed out most of them felt! My favorite side character was easily one of Jude\u2019s fellow spies, Ghost, who takes it upon himself to spend immense amounts of time training her in how to sneak, steal, and kill. It\u2019s not just that he mentors her, though \u2013 it\u2019s that he respects her, and treats her as his equal throughout all of their interactions. So help me, if he does not get MAJOR screen time in the following books, I WILL RIOT.Among other noteworthy characters were Locke, who is a complete raging asshole that I will never forgive in a million years ever, and the rest of Cardan\u2019s posse, who were also, well\u2026 complete raging assholes that I will never forgive in a million years ever.\nFaerie might be beautiful, but its beauty is like a golden stag\u2019s carcass, crawling with maggots beneath his hide, ready to burst.\n\u2192 final thoughts \u2190All in all, while there were some aspects to the story that I didn\u2019t love, I thought this was such a phenomenal story with a delightfully bizarre and varied cast of characters. I felt like I couldn\u2019t get enough of the world that Holly Black wrote, and the idea of having to wait an entire year to see what happens next physically pains me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories of fair folk, political intrigue, backstabbing, love, family, and conniving schemes.Content warning: Let me emphasize that, when you see TWs for abuse, people are not joking \u2013 as someone who has been bullied and abused, parts of this book were actually incredibly difficult for me to swallow. If you are triggered by scenes of abuse and harassment, please practice self-care before, during, and after this read.Buddy read with Julie! <3", "Please enjoy the following presentation of my reactions whilst reading this book:Beginning:Middle:End:This was NOTHING at all like what I expected it to be! I am completely shocked by how much I enjoyed this. Honestly, I didn't think I would. I had previously read, The Darkest Part of the Forest by Black, and it was just okay for me.Going into this one, I was expecting angsty romance, whiny little girls and unlikable love interests.I am so happy to report that none of these items can be found within these pages!I love strategic and politically motivated characters, which this story has in spades.Jude is a goddess, an absolute goddess, and I cannot wait for the next installment.I may write more thoughts on this once I get my shit together but maybe not. How can words even describe???? What is love???? Baby, don't hurt me.The Wicked King better be bringing all this political intrigue BACK!!", "I want to begin with saying that what probably killed this book for me was the hype. I was literally expecting the feels I got when I read A Court of Mist and Fury or Strange the Dreamer. Instead, I would have gotten the feels like when I read A Daughter of Smoke and Bone or Caraval: It was good, but like it wasn't astonishing or mind-blowing.So, story begins with a Fae coming and murdering the parents of a pair a twins and their half-Fae older sister. After witnessing this tragedy, Jude and her twin sister Taryn and her older sister Vivi are forced to live with the Fae-murderer as their father figure in the world of the Faes. Fast forward ten years, and Jude is well on her way to becoming a warrior. She knows she isn't ever going to become as good as the rest of the fae with their skills in weaponry and their reflexes, but she is trying her best if she is allowed. But, her classmates and the faes never let her and her twin sister forget that they are mortal. Always playing cruel tricks on them and pushing them around and glamouring them. Jude is done being the butt of the jokes, even though Tayrn just tries to keep her head down. One of these bullies happens to be a prince. When Jude pushes him too far, she finds herself in the middle of a game of politics that could cause a war between all the Fae Kingdoms. Doesn't that sound so legit and epic?The writing was exquisite and I just could feel the world building around me and through me and it was such an amazing experience. The faes in this world have horns or tales or different colored skin like blue or cat eyes or wings. I absolutely love those kind of fae books, which makes me believe I should pick up more of these books.Then.. there's the reason why the stars are so low: Jude. Jude was beyond A N N O Y I N G . She was aware that she wasn't a fae and she wanted to be one of them or better than them. But she never stopped complaining about being mortal. Ever. I get it: You hate being human and want to be fae. I get it: You are mortal and you want to be fae. I get it: You are weaker than the immortal beings and you want to be like them. I get it: You are slower than the faes and you want to be one of them.She never shut up about it to the point that I found myself rolling my eyes. And her character half the time did exactly the opposite of what she said she would be doing. I was just completely over her; but not to the point that I didn't love the book and wouldn't want to continue on with it. I mean, the end was a little more calm for me than I would have liked (I need more war/blood/twists.. because I obviously need to see a professional about that) but I still enjoyed it well enough. But I didn't think it needed the hype it got. It's good, but it isn't obsessively dramatically good.

Either way, here's to book two which comes out in less than a week!______________________________________\u223f4.75/5\u223fThis was absolutely lovely and magical. Ya'll, the hype surrounding this book is all very real. Please do yourself a favor, sit down with a large cup of tea/coffee and READ THIS.Where do I even begin? My mind is still reeling from all of the twists and turns! Holly Black really outdid herself with this one, you guys. She really did.The characters were amazing. Not all of them were, but the ones that had to be were brilliant. I mean, I love Holly Black for making Jude the way she was. As a girl with a heart who cares for her family and whatnot, but can also kill you and make serious threats. I mean what?! Are we finally getting strong and evil and cunningly awesome females? I seriously hope so! And, of course, I don't condone villainous people, but if it's in a book, I freaking love reading from their perspective. And let me tell you, Jude isn't that nice girl next door. She's absolutely ruthless.Then there's Cadan. I saw someone write an update saying that \"Bad guys turned to good guys is so overused,\" when describing this book and Cadan. I guess I agree with them, in a way. However, when it's done well, like the way Black made you despise Cadan in the beginning and then come to love him, is just magic in its own way. Seriously! I knew I should hate him but I couldn't stop loving him.I just realized this review has a million exclamation marks and is probably one of the worst reviews I've ever written. Oh well. I can't help myself. This was too good, and I can't coherently put words together.But honestly, if any of ya'll love magic, deception, spies, forbidden love, a kick-butt heroine, beautiful people, folklore, etc... Then, this is a book for YOU!Overall, I don't know what you're still doing here, 'cause you really ought to be out there getting into that horribly sad, yet flawlessly written, prologue. Go on.

They don\u2019t let you go around again until you get it right.\u2019People have been predicting the end of the world almost from its very beginning, so it\u2019s only natural to be sceptical when a new date is set for Judgement Day. But what if, for once, the predictions are right, and the apocalypse really is due to arrive next Saturday, just after tea?You could spend the time left drowning your sorrows, giving away all your possessions in preparation for the rapture, or laughing it off as (hopefully) just another hoax. Or you could just try to do something about it.It\u2019s a predicament that Aziraphale, a somewhat fussy angel, and Crowley, a fast-living demon now finds themselves in. They\u2019ve been living amongst Earth\u2019s mortals since The Beginning and, truth be told, have grown rather fond of the lifestyle and, in all honesty, are not actually looking forward to the coming Apocalypse.And then there\u2019s the small matter that someone appears to have misplaced the Antichrist\u2026", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1392528568l/12067.jpg", "title": "Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch", "authors": "Terry Pratchett", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12067.Good_Omens", "reviews": ["Remember back when funny books were funny? Back before you went to college and found out that Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen weren't funny after all, but Samuel Beckett and Charles Dickens were hilarious? Remember when the words on the page didn't just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity, but actually made you laugh out loud? Well, that's the kind of humor that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's 1990 release Good Omens brims with, and it is so damn good.The two British authors were both relatively unknown at the time of their partnership, having met when Gaiman (working as a journalist at the time) interviewed Pratchett on the success of his first major novel, The Colour of Magic. The two became quick friends and proceeded to write the 398 pages of the now cult classic novel by sending floppy disks through the mail and calling each other on the phone. Of course, that story is all explained in the appendix, provided you don't pick up an original printing of the book (if you do do that, however, you can probably sell it for quite a bit of change, so don't be discouraged by your lack of author interviews).But the real story at hand is, of course, the narrative of Good Omens itself--the tale of two friends, a demon named Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale who have spent all of human existence on earth and have rather come to like it, so when it comes time for the Apocalypse, they try to do whatever is in their powers to stop it. The cast of co-stars can only described as \"vast,\" with some characters only popping in long enough for Aziraphale to take over their body or to go on a shooting rampage. The main other characters though, include: the Antichrist himself, a young boy named Adam, and his gang of friends; a witchfinder named Newton Pulsifer and his love interest, Anathema Device, who just happens to be a witch (and one whose ancestor, Agnes Nutter was burned at the stake by Newton's great-great-etc. grandfather, Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer.Perhaps you're beginning to pick up on that sense of humor I mentioned?That's what makes this book so great. I'm sort of a sucker for religious humor (and religious horror movies), and I've read a lot of books about the End Days. This one has to rank near the top, maybe even as the downright finest. It's humor ranges from simple little comedic bits to social commentary on religion and the human race--but no matter how big or small the joke is, every one of them is attended to equally, and they are all funny because of that. Though some of the British jokes and references flew by me (a problem the authors usually account for in their humorous footnotes), I really did enjoy this book, all the way from the plot down to how it was written. It really is an impressive feat for a co-authored book to feel so seemless (this honestly almost puts shame to the excellent Stephen King/Peter Straub double-ups, The Talisman and Black House).So let down your guard, pack away that condescension that your professors poured into you Lit class after Lit class, and resist the urge to turn up your nose at any novel you can buy in trade paperback form in airports for $7.99 (but higher in Canada--oh wait, not anymore!). I actually laughed out loud as I read Good Omens. A few times, to be completely honest. And that's pretty impressive for a cynical, jaded old bastard like me.", "I somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously. So I couldn't help wonderingWhat Madam Bovary Might Have Thought Of Good OmensThree days later, a package arrived; there was no return address, but she immediately recognised Rodolphe's hand. It contained a paperback novel, whose title was Good Omens. Feverishly, she cast herself over it. Her English was poor, but, with the aid of a dictionary, she persevered and soon made great progress.The more she read, the greater her bewilderment became. The book at first reminded her of Candide, which she had surreptitiously read at the convent, but M. Voltaire's \u00e9sprit had been replaced by another ingredient she was unable to name; she suspected that it must be the strange English invention they called humour. All the personages were well-meaning and agreeable; the witches, the torturers of witches, the prostitutes, even the Demons of Hell; they were filled with kindness and compassion, and their worst faults amounted to an occasional mild irritability. Where were the indifference and thoughtless cruelty that surrounded her, and which had now become the very air she breathed? She did not know whether Rodolphe had sent her the book to comfort her or to mock her in her despair, and her futile attempts to resolve this question gradually resulted in an agonising headache. Her husband prescribed an infusion of valerian, and persuaded her to retire for the night; she lay sleepless in her bed a long time, until the drug finally took effect just as the sky was beginning to lighten. She dreamed of apocalyptic prophecies, red-headed women wielding swords, endless circles of horseless carriages, young boys with dogs.In the morning, she remembered that she should purchase some arsenic.__________________________________It seemed unfair for this to be one-way. So, in the spirit of granting a right of reply, here's What Good Omens Might Have Thought Of Madam Bovary\"I saw this smashin' film yesterday on TV,\" said Adam, as the Them listened attentively. \"It was called Madam Bovver-Boy -\"\"She was a lady skinhead?\" interrupted Brian.\"No, stupid,\" said Adam. \"It's a French name. Bovver-Boy. By Flow-Bear.\"\"You mean Madame Bovary, by Flaubert,\" said Wensleydale. \"I read about it in The Encyclopaedia of World Literature.\"Adam gave him a withering glance. \"That's what I said,\" he continued. \"Madam Bovver-Boy, by Flow-Bear. She's married to this doctor, and he's dead borin', so she starts hangin' around with these two lovers, and then she maxes out her credit card, so she eats arsernick and poisons herself. The bit where she's dyin' of the arsernick is dead good. Her tongue's hanging out and she's screamin' -\"\"Why did she max out her credit card?\" asked Pepper.\"She was buying presents for her lovers,\" said Adam. \"Roses an' boxes of chocolates an' stuff like that -\"\"I thought the lovers were supposed to give her presents?\" said Brian dubiously. \"My sister's boyfriend gave her this huge bunch of roses on Valentine's Day, and a box of Quality Street, and a balloon with -\"\"She gave them presents instead because it was a proto-feminist novel,\" explained Wensleydale authoritatively. \"That's what The Encyclopaedia of World Literature says.\"Adam felt that his control of the situation was slipping, and decided to up the stakes. \"It's all true,\" he said, in an exegetical move that would have had Flaubert scholars around the world clutching their foreheads. \"Based on a true story,\" he added prudently, in case the The Encyclopaedia of World Literature happened to have opinions on the subject. Behind the bushes, Aziraphale raised an eyebrow. Crowley looked defensive. \"Very loosely based,\" he whispered hastily. \"I mean, I tempted her, it's my job you know, but Gustave changed the ending for dramatic purposes. Said it didn't work to have Rodolphe sort out her debts and then settle down in a cozy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 quatre with her, L\u00e9on and her husband. I told him that's what actually happened, but he insisted the arsenic worked better...\"", "\n\n\n\n\u201cDON'T THINK OF IT AS DYING,\" said Death. \"JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.\u201d \nThe Apocalypse is not off to a good start.Ten years ago, Crowley (a demon) brought the  infant Anti-Christ to a group of Satanic Nuns who swapped the Anti-Christ with a human child.  For ten years, Aziraphale (an Angel) and Crowley educate the child on the finer points of good and evil.  \n\u201cPeople couldn't become truly holy,\" he said, \"unless they also had the opportunity to be definitively wicked.\"\nThen, when the Anti-Christ was supposed to come into his full powers, Crowley and Aziraphale realize that they didn't have the right child.\n\nSH*T\n\nFurthermore, they simultaneously realize that they rather like Earth. If the holy war was allowed to finish, then everything would be destroyed and divvied up between the two realms - and that divide would be terrible. \nHell may have all the best composers, but heaven has all the best choreographers.\n So, it's up to them to find the Anti-Christ and stop the apocalypse. They only have seven to days to do it. It's just going to be one of those weeks.This one was absolutely hilarious! There were so, so many fun quirks and tangents in this book. Seriously great satire throughout! All the little details just make it pop. Such as Crowley's plant-tending method: \nWhat he did was put the fear of God into them.More precisely, the fear of Crowley.In addition to which, every couple of months Crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly, or succumbing to leaf-wilt or browning, or just didn't look quite as good as the others, and he would carry it around to all the other plants. \"Say goodbye to your friend,\" he'd say to them. \"He just couldn't cut it. . . \"Then he would leave the flat with the offending plant, and return an hour or so later with a large, empty flower pot, which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the flat.The plants were the most luxurious, verdant, and beautiful in London. Also the most terrified.\nDefinitely one of those off-the-wall fun reads.

The varied tone and inflection just made it come alive.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!", "Overall, this book was a huge disappointment for me. I\u2019d heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years. When I finally started it, I was about 20 pages into it and thought, \u201cYes! This is going to be one of the most entertaining books I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d It was like reading The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide for the first time again. It was witty and fast-paced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion. And then about halfway through, I realized that I just wasn't really laughing as much anymore. The story seemed to get bogged down with characters that weren\u2019t that interesting for me to read about and who I often found a bit annoying. Most notably, the 11-year-old Antichrist and his friends seemed really out of place in the book. They felt like they would have been at home in a Norman Rockwell painting (or British equivalent)\u2014a ragtag bunch of kids with slingshots and backyard adventures. I think that I was supposed to find them and their inane conversations entertaining, maybe even a little bit cute, but every time they came around, which felt like quite a bit, I thought that the book just screeched to a halt.Most of the other characters in the book were great fun to read\u2014the demon and the angel and their strange sort of friendship was easily the best part of the book for me. The four horsemen of the apocalypse were also a lot of fun, at least most of the time. Overall, the premise was brilliant. What a disappointment for me that it just couldn\u2019t keep it together throughout. The ending seemed contrived and the resolution was just unsatisfying for me. I know that so many people loved this book. I wish that I could have enjoyed it as much as they did.", "(A-) 80% | Very GoodNotes: Not as funny as I\u2019d anticipated, and at times it\u2019s a bit too absurd for my tastes, but a good ending and loads of charm.", "Image source imdb.Don\u2019t be misled by those who class this as fantasy, humour, or just fiction. This is actually a profound philosophical and theological treatise, exploring good and evil, nature versus nurture, free will, war, pollution, and organised religion. \ud83d\ude09But it\u2019s cleverly disguised as a madcap caper featuring angels, demons, the M25 motorway, Manchester, raining fish, dolphins, Atlantis, aliens, the Apocalypse, the young Antichrist, Americans, footnotes for Americans, tunnelling Tibetans, witches, witch-finders, whales, Hell's Angels, Queen and Freddie Mercury, junk food made of junk, nuclear power, a flaming car, satanic nuns, an inadvertent baby-swap, a book of prophecy, and more besides. Lots of ineffability, too.The writing is so like Douglas Adams that it could be mistaken for a missing volume of Hitchhiker's, except for the pages of Just William slipped in, Calvino style.The Heavy StuffInscription from Terry: \u201cWe made the Devil do it\u2026\u201dIt echoes a line in the book: \u201cThe Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything. He didn\u2019t have to.\u201d The weight is smuggled into a plot that is simultaneously simple, complicated, and counter-intuitive. The Antichrist is born, but accidentally goes to a boringly normal, rural couple, rather than the intended satanists. With the Apocalypse due around his 11th birthday, opposing forces try to ensure they\u2019ll win, which requires first realising there\u2019s been a mix up - and then fixing it. On that simple trunk, a plethora of sub-plots and an even larger number of larger-than-life characters twist, and climb, and intertwine.Amidst the chaos and the warring factions, the fundamental question is whether Adam, the young Antichrist, will fulfil his destiny, whether \u201cBirth is just the start.. Upbringing is everything\u201d. After all, the Devil started off as an angel.The Odd CoupleAziraphale (angel) and Crowley (demon) have been on Earth a long time, developed a grudging fondness for it, its inhabitants, and even each other. Their tetchily co-operative, affectionately teasing relationship is central to the plot, the philosophy, and the humour.They\u2019ve reached an \u201cArrangement\u201d after realising \u201cthey have more in common with their immediate opponent than their remote allies\u2026 tacit non-interference\u2026 made certain that while neither really won, also neither really lost.\u201d Heaven wants to win the war; humanised Aziraphale comes to realise that he would prefer to avoid it.Bibliophilia\u201cAziraphale was an angel, but he also worshiped books.\u201d \u201cAziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours - he was incredibly good at it.\u201dNear where where Pratchett spent much of his life, was a cottage given over to second hand books. There were no unpleasant smells, but opening hours were limited, as were payment methods. Books were piled high and deep (double/triple) and vaguely sorted by category, but not by author... except for Pratchett. Here it is (sadly, it closed in 2018): There\u2019s a larger version in my GR photos HERE. Quotes - Religion* \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.\u201dI particularly like the fact the last phrase is emphasised with italics, even though, in a pitch-dark room, it\u2019s barely relevant. * \u201cWhen it came to avoiding going to church, the church he solidly avoided going to was\u2026 no-nonsense Church of England.\u201d* \u201cBeing brought up as a Satanist tended to take the edge off it. A Saturday thing.\u201d* Crowley is embarrassed by the enthusiasm of satanists, just as a \u201cVietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to Neighbourhood Watch meetings\u201d. * \u201cVoodoun is a very interesting religion for the whole family, even those members of it who are dead.\u201d* \u201cMarvin got religion. Not the quiet, personal kind, that involves doing good deeds and living a better life; not even the kind that involves putting on a suit and ringing people\u2019s door bells; but the kind that involves having your own TV network and getting people to send you money.\u201dQuotes - Good and Evil* \u201cMost demons weren\u2019t deep down evil\u201d but like \u201ctax inspectors - doing an unpopular job, maybe, but essential to the overall operation\u201d.* Often, the difference between good and evil isn\u2019t obvious: some of the world leaders Aziraphale thinks good are assumed to be evil by Crowley.* \u201cIf we beat them we\u2019d have to be our own deadly enemies\u2026 it\u2019s no good anyone winning\u201d. So, \u201cYou just had to decide who your friends really were.\u201d Quotes - Destiny versus Free WillSlightly spoilery.* \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse to be who you are\u2026 Your birth and destiny are part of the Great Plan.\u201d...\u201cI don\u2019t see why it matters what is written\u2026 It can always be crossed out.\u201d* \u201cHe was left alone! He grew up human! He\u2019s not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate, he\u2019s just\u2026 a human incarnate.\u201d* \u201cNo one around Adam was ever in full control of their own mind\u201d.Quotes - Time* \u201cThe future came and went in the mildly discouraging way that futures do.\u201d* \u201cMemory\u2026 works backwards as well as forwards\u2026 Agnes didn\u2019t see the future. That\u2019s just a metaphor. She remembered it.\u201d* \u201cOn the cusp of recollection, a memory of things that hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d* Accurate predictions are little use if they\u2019re too narrow and specific. For example, \u201cDo notte buye Betamacks\u201d was only meaningful for a few short years.* \u201cDON\u2019T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.\u201dQuotes - People and Relationships* \u201cMany people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide.\u201d* \u201cCourting is always difficult when\u2026 an elderly female relative in the house\u2026 It\u2019s much worse when the relative has been dead for three hundred years.\u201d* \u201cNewt had indeed been harbouring certain thoughts about Anathema; not just harbouring them, in fact, but dry-docking them, refitting them, giving them a good coat of paint and scraping the barnacles off their bottom.\u201d* \u201cPollution [one of the Apocalyptic Horsepersons], while still walking, nevertheless gave the impression of oozing.\u201dQuotes - Other* \u201cA rain-swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins.\u201d* \u201cLeaping gratefully onto this new ice floe in the bewildering stream of consciousness.\u201d* \u201cHer spelling\u2026 was not so much appalling as three hundred years too late.\u201d Similarly, if anyone questions something my father says or writes, he claims it\u2019s just archaic; impossible to disprove!* \u201cEvery dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf.\u201dQuote - Best One-LinerA Hell\u2019s Angel asks one of the biking Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse what chapter they belong to: \u201cREVELATIONS, he said. CHAPTER SIX. \u2018Verses two to eight\u2019, added the boy\u2026 helpfully.\u201dTV AdaptationFab cast, and Gaimain was heavily involved, so my hopes were high, and largely rewarded. David Tennant as Crowley and Michael Sheen as Aziraphale were brilliant together, and it looked great. It suffered a little from being too similar to the very recent adaptation of American Gods (see my review HERE). And Aziraphale's bibliophilia was underplayed, but overall, good.

Eight-year-olds with overactive imaginations were really NOT the intended audience of *that* book, after all.WARNING: THERE WILL BE MILD SPOILERS. BECAUSE I CAN.As predicted by the titular 17th century witch Agnes Nutter in her extremely nice accurate book of prophecies, handed down through centuries to her last living \"professional descendant\" Anathema Device, Armageddon is quickly approaching.

And Grievous Bodily Harm, Cruelty To Animals, Things Not Working Properly Even After You've Given Them A Good Thumping but secretly No Alcohol Lager, and Really Cool People travelled with them.\u201d \n And this upcoming major event is a source of some serious worry for eternal-enemies-turned-reluctant-friends Aziraphale (An angel, and a part-time rare book dealer) and Crowley (An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards), the duo who, after six thousand years, have \"gone native\" and would infinitely prefer this world to the future where either side wins - the future (oh the horror!) without good music or bookshops or sushi restaurants. And so the unlikely allies decide to band together to prevent the end of the world.\"That's how it goes, you think you're on top of the world, and suddenly they spring Armageddon on you.\" Except things do not go as planned....(The lovely images above can be seen here and here).You see, the young 'Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness', due to an unforeseen turn of circumstances, happens to grow up outside of the influence of either celestial/underworld force. Aptly named Adam, he grows up - as his name suggests - perfectly human, in a little corner of paradise - the English village of Lower Tadfield. But Agnes Nutter is never wrong, and as her prophesies suggest, shortly after Adam's eleventh birthday (on which he DOES get a much wanted Hellhound Dog) the events of the end of the world are set in their inevitable, ineffable motion. But Adam's essential humanity puts a new spin on this old story:\"Something was happening inside his head.It was aching. Thoughts were arriving there without him having to think them. Something was saying, You can do something, Adam Young. You can make it all better. You can do anything you want. And what was saying this to him was ... him. Part of him, deep down. Part of him that had been attached to him all these years and not really noticed, like a shadow. It was saying: yes, it's a rotten world. It could have been great. But now it's rotten, and it's time to do something about it. That's what you're here for. To make it all better.\"The problem with the Antichrist Adam is that he, a human eleven-year-old boy, is fueled - unexpectedly - by Love and righteous indignation. He loves this world, and he, coming into his power, wants a very human thing - he wants to make it better. Don't we all? But do (and can?) his good intentions make any difference in the way things have been prophesied to go?\n\"It's like you said the other day,\" said Adam. \"You grow up readin' about pirates and cowboys and spacemen and stuff, and jus' when you think the world's all full of amazin' things, they tell you it's really all dead whales and chopped-down forests and nucular waste hangin' about for millions of years. 'Snot worth growin' up for, if you ask my opinion.\"If there is one thing this book gets through it's the belief in humanity. Not in its wickedness or goodness or anything like that. Just humanity, in all the multifaceted nature of it, in its righteousness and wretchedness, love and cruelty, strengths and weaknesses, stupidity and wisdom. \"And just when you'd think they were more malignant than ever Hell could be, they could occasionally show more grace than Heaven ever dreamed of. Often the same individual was involved. It was this free-will thing, of course. It was a bugger.\"Sometimes, maybe, when left to our own devices, when not preached to in one way or another, we can perhaps develop into flawed but hopefully decent beings - like Adam, named after the first human in the prophetic fashion, after all. Because what makes life interesting, as a particular angel and demon would loudly attest to, is precisely the combination of good and evil, nice and nasty, mean and kind that we all possess, in the precarious and miraculous balance that is the true treasure of humanity. Because it makes us act like people.\"I don't see what's so triflic about creating people as people and then gettin' upset 'cos they act like people,\u201d said Adam severely. \u201cAnyway, if you stopped tellin' people it's all sorted out after they're dead, they might try sorting it all out while they're alive.\"And maybe, just maybe, due to our always-balancing nature on the borderline between two conflicting universes that we, humans, inhabit, we will be able to eventually figure it out - without anyone messing with our heads, filling them with the Good or the Evil, endlessly preaching what they believe to be true - but simple letting us be ourselves. Maybe we will figure things out on our own.\"Adam stood smiling at the two of them, a small figure perfectly poised exactly between Heaven and Hell.Crowley grabbed Aziraphale's arm. \"You know what happened?\" he hissed excitedly. \"He was left alone! He grew up human! He's not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate, he's just ... a human incarnate.\"==============================........The brilliant Pratchett/Gaiman duo provides everything these two authors are famous for - easy readability, dry intelligent sarcasm-infused humor, seamless plot that pushes the limits of imagination while staying perfectly grounded in (albeit fantastical) reality, and first and foremost, very apt observations about human nature, as well as (in a true Pratchett-like way) a complete irreverence for the set-in-stone beliefs and ideas. At times it's easy for those familiar with their respective styles to tell which one of them penned which part, at times it's impossible - but it doesn't matter as their writing styles blend together so well, so seamlessly, so seemingly effortlessly.This is an excellent book - both funny and serious, at times utterly unpredictable, at times baffling, at times logical. It's a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to seriously reflect upon after having a good laugh. And for all of that it gets the ineffable five stars.\nHe stared down at the golden curls of the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.\"You know,\" he concluded, after a while, \"I think he actually looks like an Adam.\"\n--------June 2013: I just listened to this one on audiobook - AGAIN. I love it more and more with each time I do. I have to advise - if you plan to listen to this one, please get the British version with Stephen Briggs as the narrator (Isis Publishing) - it is lightyears better than Harper Audio. Stephen Briggs is amazing!", "I knew from the first page that this book would not work for me.I slogged through about half of it and gave up. I lost the thread of the plot long before due to my lack of interest in everything this book is. It all felt forced, like the themes and ideas were shoved into the narrative and that the plot had to adapt to fit them in. It was trying too hard to be funny rather than actually being funny. Life is far too short for books I don\u2019t enjoy. And I could never enjoy this. It felt like it was written by two guys who had just finished school and were ready to explode their ideas into some creative project that could be a piece of brilliance or a real chore depending on the reader tastes. And this just sent me right to sleep. I was glad to stop when I did.I think my main problem is that I\u2019ve seen how much better each writer can do. I\u2019ve read Gaiman at his best. I\u2019ve been inspired by his words and I have found part of myself in his stories. I\u2019ve laughed out loud with Pratchett and I\u2019ve tasted the sharpness of his wit. This felt like a shadow of what each writer can do; it holds a mere suggestion of the brilliance and creative spark each would wield at his fingertips. It was just juvenile. Maybe I came into with the wrong mind-set. Maybe I expected too much or perhaps the humour is just wasted on me. Either way, this one just isn\u2019t for me.", "\nThis book has been recommended to me for years. Everyone has been telling me how funny it is and...Nope.Didn't laugh. Didn't smile.

With an endearing cast of characters, wit-laden dialogues, and brilliant British humour, phenomenal writers Pratchett and Gaiman concocts a story about the end of the world in cataclysmic (hilarious) proportions. Everything seems set and the cosmic game of chess is about to happen... well, close enough except that someone has terribly misdelivered, misplaced, and misguided the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness, aye, lost the anti-Christ, have we, mates?

However, in the talented minds of Pratchett and Gaiman, it\u2019s the perfect setting. Another disclosure, I\u2019m a sucker for British humour \u2013 give me Monty Python, Douglas Adams, Benny Hill, Red Dwarf, and even Rickey Gervais and I\u2019ll right larf out loude! It\u2019s just the right mix of clever, deadpan, sarcasm, innuendo, and self-deprecation for me.I wanted to get this read before I watched the new Amazon Prime series. It\u2019s a good time to be reading this book, as we all need a laugh (or at least I do). In a time where some days feel like the start of the apocalypse (climate change, Middle East violence, American & British politics, virus pandemics, etc.. etc.), it feels good to laugh at Judgement Day.For me this book read much more like a Terry Pratchett story, than a Neil Gaiman tale. I was impressed that the writing style seemed to be consistent throughout. I think that\u2019s as much Gaiman\u2019s ability to write in a Terry Pratchett style as anything. In the aftermatter, P&G amusingly reveal that they can no longer remember exactly who wrote what and suspect that neither wrote some of the parts.As to the story, this book has many great characters, a complex, winding plot, and plenty of charm and surprises. You\u2019ll meet angels, demons, inept witch hunters, the four horsemen, and even the anti-Christ. However, it\u2019s primarily the humor that carries it. It\u2019s full of twists of phases, funny observations, and of course, the trademark Pratchett footnotes. I enjoyed the humor more than the story, but it never was boring. Once again, I feel compelled to explain why I am just now reading this novel, first published in 1990. Well, in the 1990\u2019s, I had a wife, two young children, a cat, an older, fixer upper home with a needy yard, and an intense job. Something had to give. So I fully admit I missed an entire decade of literature, news, and music. I really got into Pearl Jam in about 2002 . . . Any who, if you enjoy British humor, you\u2019ll enjoy this book, if you don\u2019t, you likely won\u2019t. If you are easily offended by religious satire, you should probably skip this.

[Then in her normal voice] Geronimo is that you? [And again in the deep voice] Yes, this\u2019n is me.Neville: This is just like in that old book by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, Good Omens, I mean JUST like it!Madam Tracey: [In the Geronimo voice] How you mean?Ron: I read that book, you\u2019re right; there is a spiritual medium who pretends to be led into the spirit world by Geronimo!Madam Tracey: Eh, gentlemen, please, you must concentrate \u2026 Um, hey, wait a minute; I really am feeling a presence!Freddy Mercury: [singing] Can anybody find me, somebody to love?Neville: What?? Who\u2019s that? Where did that voice come from, is that Freddy Mercury?Freddy: Yes, Neville, it is I, Freddy Mercury, coming to you from the Great Beyond! This s\u00e9ance has created a paranormal gateway by the mention of Pratchett and Gaiman\u2019s collaboration.Terry Pratchett: Hello! What have we here?Neil Gaiman: It appears that we have intruded upon a s\u00e9ance, I feel invited, don\u2019t you?Terry: I do, as well, Neil, and how is everyone tonight?[the table sits in stunned, awkward silence]Freddy: Onstage, I was a devil. But I was hardly a social reject, may we be included in your s\u00e9ance, you were attempting to contact the spirit world weren\u2019t you?Marge: Um, well, I wanted to speak to my deceased sister Pamela.Terry: Now there\u2019s a lovely girl, dear, dear Pamela.Neville: Wait! I see, we mentioned your book Good Omens and we are here with Madam Tracey, and \u2026Neil: And here we are, lovely to join you, also nice to see Lower Tadfield still standing after all this time, and that you remember us. Yes, Good Omens was a first-rate occult book, full of catchy prophecies and witty Pratchett sayings.Terry: Yes, indeed, like this one: \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.\u201dNeil: Yes, that was a good one, and pivotal for that story. Also, here was one that I very much liked: \u201cMost books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft were written by men.\u201d Isn\u2019t that right, Madam Tracey?Madam Tracey: Um, er, ah \u2026Ron: What was so special about Good Omens that could create a spiritual gateway to open up and visit us here?Terry: Good Omens was about the end of the world, about a spiritual conflict, but mainly about being human, and how even angels and demons, yes even the Anti-Christ can find happiness here on earth and so we should too, or some such balderdash, I recall it selling rather well.Neville: The end of the world? Is it coming?Freddy: Sooner than you would think, Neville, but then I\u2019m just a musical prostitute, my dear.Neil: Armageddon is scheduled to begin next week.[The table sits in horrified silence]Neil: Naaah! Just messing with you! [All the ghosts laugh]H.P. Lovecraft: Hi guys, interrupting a s\u00e9ance? Can I join in?

Unfortunately, I'm just not one of them. I usually like Pratchett's work, and there are a few comic touches that I liked here, but overall the unbelievably slow pace of the latter half of this story nearly drove me bonkers. It skips over about 10 years in a few chapters, and then camps out at 6 hours 'til doomsday for hundreds of pages. The dialogue of the children was tiresome, and the only character remotely 3-dimensional was the demon Crowley. I began skimming pages before giving up altogether on it a few chapters from the end. I would say it's not my style of book, but that's not true: again, I like Pratchett's other works, and I'm a Douglas Adams fan as well. This one just didn't hit my funny bone, I guess.

You know, see if it was really as good as I remembered?Huh.It was actually better. Hilarious! The 5 star rating stands!Good Omens is going to go down as one of my favorites. I wouldn't say that I laughed out loud, but I snorted once or twice and smiled the whole way through. Who would have thought the apocalypse could be so funny?! Evidently Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Personally, I thought it was a great coming of age story about a boy named Adam Young.  Warning: If you are one of those people who wear a What Would Jesus Do? bracelet and believes that the purple Teletubby really is gay? This is not the book for you. Just put it down and grab something by C.S. Lewis.The story centers around an angel and a demon who have spent thousands of years on earth together and have quite a good working relationship. Everything is running along smoothly until Crowley (said demon) is charged with delivering the Antichrist to his new family.In other words, handing over the Spawn of Hell to a bunch of (satanic) nuns who will switch him out with a human baby who has just been born. Once the deed is done, Crowley decides to enlist Aziraphale (said angel) to help him stop the coming apocalypse. Because the food and music on Earth is really good.They have eleven years before the boy reaches his full potential, but unfortunately, due to a mix up with the Satanic switcheroo, the wrong kid gets pegged as the Antichrist and the real Antichrist gets a normal life. It's a Nature vs Nurture + The Power of Friendship + The Odd Couple kind of thing.There's a lot more to it than that, but you get the gist.Excellent story. Go give it whirl!", "This novel spoof of THE OMEN is absolutely hilarious. From the four bikers of the apocalypse to adorable hell hounds, it's my absolute favorite offering from Terry Pratchett -- his humor mixed with Neil Gaiman's is absolute win in my opinion. ***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read. Consider a novel's presence on my Goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement.

Even though I adore almost every word he puts to paper, I am still aware of the fact that he is not everyone's cup of tea. More often it is the over-saturation of his cheek that becomes too much and people loose the underlined analysis of human behavior in which lays his greatest strength. I would be the first one to recommend his work, but I will also be the one to warn you to space his works good time apart in order to truly savor his wisdom and turn of phrase. After finishing any of his books I am always tempted to immediately jump into the next, but that would do me and the book a disservice. So now I treat them as precious gems - the rarer, the more time and adoration I can lavish on each!!! \n\"... \"Over the years Crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness.

The series misses on one count, we could do with more of the Them, but really now! Child labor laws and all that. Episode 3's epic cold open is, by itself, worth subscribing to Prime for.

Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon\u2014both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle\u2014are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . . My Review: The Son of Satan is coming, and that's gonna be that. Except the angel who's supposed to defeat him and the demon who's supposed to make sure he triumphs have mainstreamed and don't much feel like giving up their cush jobs. HQ on both sides isn't having any, and hijinks ensue.I got this book at \"New York Is Book Country\" in 1990. Workman had a big push on to make the book a hit...their booth that year had a bunch of editorial assistants and editors all dressed up funny, waving signs about the world ending tomorrow, passing out fliers promoting the book, yelling provocative predictions drawn from the book at passers-by. I loved it as street theater, and bought the book because I liked their energetic promotion of it.I chuckled several times, laughed out loud once, and put the book away from 1990 until it was lost in the move in 2008, and never once in 18 years remembered that I owned it or had read it. I found the above para and was mildly surprised I'd bothered to review such a slight bagatelle of a book.But credit where credit is due: The fact that Pestilence, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, retired when penicillin was introduced and was replaced by Pollution, made me laugh and laugh hard. I'm still giggling 22+ years on.", " This has got to be one of the funniest satires I've ever read. I suppose the closest comparison I could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to Dogma, but filtered through a distinctly British lense. That description doesn't really do the story justice, but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book. The whole premise, and I'm not giving much away here, begins with the accidental \"mis-placement\" of the infant Antichrist during a complex baby-swapping procedure intended to kick off the Apocalypse. It's all down hill from there.  This book is funny, irreverent, and at times surprisingly insightful. While some parts of the book may seem cliched or even kitschy, the book never puts up the pretense of being revolutionary or edgy. The characters, like any melodrama, are intended to be archetypal, so even the relatively predictable changes that occur seem appropriate in the context of the story. The surprises are really in the details, and in that regard the execution is brilliant. To give you an example, the devil Crowly drives a car in which the tape-deck will transform any tape placed in it into a copy of \"Queen's Greatest Hits\" within a very short period of time after one hits the play button. Now I love \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as much as the next guy, but an eternity of nothing but THAT particular album?! That's the kind of devilry that works on many levels.", "I read this book before I tried to tackle Pratchett on his own merit, so I may have to retroactively skew this review based upon what I now know. The book is enjoyable, but may suffer from the fact that it represents its two authors at what seems to be their most basic states.There is no question as to the recognizability of both Gaiman's and Pratchett's respective styles here, but neither seems to add anything to the other. One of Gaiman's weaknesses is surely his general lack of humor. Anything that makes you laugh in his books isn't likely to qualify as a joke. While this could have been remedied by Pratchett's collaboration, his humor tends to be more groan-worthy than profound.It seemed to me that, by collaborating, both authors felt a need to simplify and de-personalize their respective styles, which for Gaiman meant an unfortunate loss of much of his dark charm, and for Pratchett that he was even more watered down than usual.I know a lot of people, especially fantasy fans, love this book, and I will admit that it is romp-y, easily digestible, and certainly doesn't betray the inclinations of either author. Unfortunately, it also doesn't surpass them or create anything new or interesting. The whole is less than the sum of its respective parts. However, certainly worth a read; if only to get a fix of Gaiman while waiting for him to actually finish his next book.UPDATE: After reading Gaiman's Anansi Boys, I have come to find that he can be quite uproariously and side-splittingly funny. I am now unsure just what part Pratchett played in Good Omens at all.My Fantasy Book Suggestions", "In the beginning, there were a few words, and the words were with Neil Gaiman, and he saw that they were good words, so he passed them on to Terry Pratchett, so that he could make light of them. And it was morning (and Neil slept and Terry wrote) and it was night (and Terry slept and Neil wrote) - the first chapter. Thus (or similarly, for the book in the book is only rarely cited directly!) spoke Agnes Nutter, the nice and very accurate prophetess. She would also have said (if she had been blessed or cursed with not only the facts, but also with the UNDERSTANDING of the facts) that it was prophesied that the bible was written to become the confusing yet entertaining template for a masterpiece of comic fiction - and everybody knows that is a devilishly hard task to pull off, the comic genre being the most complicated one, but divine if if works out! (The reason holy books aren't funny is that they haven't gained the required level of sophistication yet - they take themselves too literally and too seriously, and that is stylistical suicide, as we all know from listening to the holy books' human personifications - the preachers and politicians - which is why they are better suited to be comic material than comedy show producers).If anybody (Agnes Nutter for example) had told me in 1990 that there was a recently published book which told the incredible story of the world in 2019 and showed the perfect parable of our current mess in the body of an Antichrist - born to save the world from destruction by the joint narcissism of Heaven and Hell - and that the said Antichrist would take the shape of an 11-year-old environmentalist worrying about our eco systems, I would have been doubtful. I would even have said it sounded way too much like the conspiring universe of the unbearable awfulness of The Alchemist, which was interestingly written at about the same time (proving that stupidity and brilliance are only a sense of humour apart!). So I guess the International Express delivery man had clear instructions not to deliver Good Omens to me until I had finally got ready for it by watching human nature carrying out the work gods and devils were paid to do (and I don't mean the M25 London Orbital specifically, even though it is a masterpiece both Heaven and Hell claim).Now that I have been provided with the Good Omens (it really is quite strange how references to that sheepish ANTI-NOVEL keep sneaking into the review of THE NOVEL), I have to spoil the fun and tell you all that Armageddon is off the table. It was an idea that didn't work out in practical terms, as the Antichrist pointed out quite cleverly: it can't be about having a winning and a losing side, as the \"winners\" will want to continue the squabble and turn on each other. It is about making the best of the mess. About \"not getting along\" in peace!Good Omens is a joyride to the tune of Europe's Final Countdown, unsubtly interrupted in medias res by Queen singing The Show Must Go On...Amen.", "I won't lie: I read this because it has a) Crowley in it, and b) it's an adult book and I was adulting. (That was exhausting though. Please, lead me back to the children's aisle. That's where I belong.)  I totally enjoyed it though because it's HILARIOUS.  Yeah maybe the story is a bit waffly in places and there are some useless tangents it runs off on, but it is downright funny. Why? Oh, oh keep calm. I'll show you.  First of all, it is SO like the Supernatural TV series.  What can I say? I'm a huge fan. I'm such a huge fan that I picked up this book because I recognised THE DEMON'S NAMES. Come on. That's probably a little on the weird side. I also wanted to read more Neil Gaiman (I'd only read Coraline before now) and start for the first time something by Terry Pratchett. I'm completely sold to both of them.  But I really think that the Supernatural TV series borrowed stuff from this.  Or else the coincidences are pretty dang astounding. For once that doesn't make me angry though. This was first published in 1990, so I know they're not copying. So that's okay.So we have the stars: Crowley and Aziraphale. I love them so much.They're totally Cas and Crowley from Supernatural. Down to AZIRAPHALE WEARS A FREAKING TRENCH COAT. Aziraphale looked down at his new body which was, unfortunately, very much like his old body, although the overcoat was cleaner. (pg. 364)Plus Aziraphale is unfortunately devoid of a lot of pop references and is very serious. And also fantastically awesome. Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a treeful of monkeys on nitrous oxide.Crowley isn't the king of hell though, like in the TV series. He's kind of just...a demon who was told to do a job (plant the antichrist baby in the correct family) and who messed that up and therefore LOST THE ANTICHRIST. I mean, come on! He lost the antichrist. Can we take a moment to just laugh, okay?! The ridiculousness. Also there's plenty of banter like this: \"But it might be written diffferently somewhere else,\" said Crowley. \"Where you can't read it.\"\"In bigger letters,\" said Aziraphale.\"Underlined,\" Crowley added. \"Twice,\" suggested Aziraphale.  And this:  Aziraphale: \"I was going to ask you the same thing -- WATCH OUT FOR THE PEDESTRIAN!\"Crowley: \"It's on the street, it knows the risks it's taking!\" img src=\"http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m77...\" width=\"400\" height=\"209\" alt=\"description\"/> Besides being funny and having epic characters, I also enjoyed the hilarity of the plot and the genius of the twists.  It loosely used facts and lore and turned it into an epic and warped English version of having an apocalypse before dinner. It's not too ridiculous though. Although I thought the antichrist would be older. He's 11. And named Adam.Okay! Okay! Sorry about all the comparisons. BUT I'M KIND OF OBSESSED WITH THE TV SERIES. What I didn't like?Well, it got a bit boring when it dived into Anathema and Newt's story line. I honestly couldn't care less about them. The middle-ish of the book isn't so much about Crowley, so I was disappointed. But it had more Adam and he had an interesting story. I loved his hellhound that turned into a little tiny dog because it's master unknowingly requested it. A hellhound...as a tiny dog. BAH AHAHA. The writing was also thick. It's not YA writing, which is what I'm used to. I'm not saying it was bad, but I am a \"get to the point already\" kind of reader, so it was a struggle to stay motivated at times. It's definitely inspired me to read some Terry Pratchett though and maybe dig out more Neil Gaiman. I love these guys. They have the best senses of humour the world could ask for and this book is genius.

Well, certain reads and re-reads lend themselves well to anniversaries and horsemen. :) And YES I was forced to re-read this because I was told I must be crazy to only give this a three-star rating and LOOK! It's about the be on the tele! So I agreed to give it another shot.I'm adding a half star. Why only that? Because all the things I love most about Pratchett, in general, is done better in his Discworld books. Because Gaiman's iconoclastic use of mythology and dark humor was always a bit more detailed and deep in his own works. Together, Pratchett's humor feels like a bunch of talking heads cracking witticisms and Gaiman's depth gets lost in peddling bikes.That is NOT to say that I didn't find vast swaths of this book awesome, because I did. The horsemen, the celestial buddies, and even Anathema and Adam were quite delightful at times. Unfortunately, there is still something about this book that bounced off me. You'd think that reading it 5 years apart might have loosened something in me. That reading all of Pratchett's works a second time and some of Gaiman's two times as well might have softened my heart to this more... but no. I'm simply not much of a fan of pastoral fantasies.It's a good thing this is a great book for almost everyone else, however! :) :) I'm pretty sure I'm going to love the television version, regardless. :)Original Review:It was funny enough for a novel about 11-year-old antichrists and barroom jokes about a devil and an angel. On the other hand, I must be a bit severe and say that I loved practically everything else by both of these authors a lot more than this single novel with them together. The characters weren't bad, they were just elaborate set-ups for the humorous device. On the other hand, I did really like Anathema Device. I'm not disappointed in reading it, I simply won't recommend it due to the very outdated humor. (Think about answering machine or cassette jokes, and you've got it.)", "No getting around it, it IS funny! Clever satire that\u2019s harmlessly irreverent. I wasn\u2019t rolling on the floor or anything but I had 4 (I counted) laugh-out-loud moments, a few good giggles & a smile on my face throughout. A great story that moves along very nicely, as Good and Evil (as represented by the angel Aziraphale & the demon Crowley) join forces to try & avert the apocalypse. Definitely held my interest. The interplay between these two was what really made the story, liked it when they put their differences aside & just hung out. Another highlight was the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse; Death, War, Famine & Pollution (yes pollution...I know, it\u2019s supposed to be Pestilence - read the book:)) who make their appearance as Hell\u2019s Angels. Actually the book is loaded with great characters, there's even a cute little dog, The Hound from Hell morphed into a cat chasing mongrel. Literature defined. Simple enough to grasp but complex enough to inspire thought. Yeh, it\u2019s that. You might find yourself contemplating some pretty deep stuff, like \"the big ineffable plan\"  or the murky line defining mankind as basicly good or evil. Or maybe not, I\u2019ve been over-thinking everything lately.\"Crowley found devil worshippers a little embarrassing.

Many of the reviews of Good Omens compare it to Douglas Adams. There are some similarities in that much of the story occurs outside the bounds of normal reality, it's genuinely funny, and very British. But I found the overall tone to be softer, less snarky, and more intentionally philosophical in nature. While the book is very entertaining, it also asks some exceedingly interesting questions. In particular: does the Antichrist have free will?", "\nNot very amusing attempt at biblical humor. It was a chore. I did not finish it, getting through 130 pages before casting it aside.

However, something goes hilariously wrong with the switch.11 years later Armageddon is just around the corner but neither Crowley nor Aziraphale want the world to end because then there will be no feeding the ducks in the park, no lunch dates in the Ritz, no quaint little bookshops or cool Bentleys.Then there is the Antichrist himself, now 11 years old and not exactly what Heaven or Hell had imagined.Thus commences a hilarious romp in the English countryside with the Four Horsepersons, some bikers, children and a very special hellhound.For anyone wanting a glimpse at what this might look like, here is the trailer for the show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZSXl...Seriously, what Pratchett and Gaiman created here is not just a great collaboration - this reads as if it came from one hand, showcasing how similar the two men were and how well these two minds therefore worked together. Some of the creations here are linked almost directly to the authors' other works so there is a certain feeling of coming home whenever I immerse myself in the story.The simple and yet thrilling scenery painted with the poignant humour and sharp social and political criticism that shines through each page in a delicate and tactful way is something to be cherished, something special that one doesn't find too often. *sighs contently*-------------------Original review:Wonderful cooperation between two of the funniest men on the planet: Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett!If you think one of them was funny, you can imagine the kind of bellyache I've got from laughing almost uncontrollably at all the jests and jokes and silliness from both of them!The story is quite simple: as written in various prophecies, Armageddon is just around the corner. But an angel and a demon quite like their lives on Earth so they have other plans (such as feeding the ducks).The characters are all elaborate, quirky and original; the writing is not just funny but also delivers some important messages in a light way and all the chapters weave into one another fluidly (which is not to be taken for granted in just any cooperation).It was a marvellous journey to read the book, which I started when the BBC radio dramatisation was advertised last December. Now I've finished the book AND, simultaneously, listenend to the radio series and have to say that the wonderful cast that was put together fit their roles perfectly! Well done to all! I highly recommend readers of the book to listen to the BBC dramatisation as well!P.S.: This is my hardcover edition. Way back when, I had the extreme luck of coincidentally getting what I consider the version with the best/funniest cover design."], "genre": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Humor", "Fantasy", "Urban Fantasy"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/4110990-good-omens-the-nice-and-accurate-prophecies-of-agnes-nutter-witch", "avg_ratings": "4.25", "ShelvedNumber": "1943"}

The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle\u2014the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle\u2019s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord\u2019s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore\u2019s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry\u2019s\u2014and Hogwarts\u2019s\u2014future in shadow.Source: http://harrypotter.scholastic.com", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361039191l/1.jpg", "title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "authors": "J.K.

OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:\u2022 Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.\u2022 Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.\u2022 I also adore how sensible Ginny is. \u2022 Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.\u2022 I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. \u2022 Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.\u2022 Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. \u2022 I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. \u2022 ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)\u2022 Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. \u2022 Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...\u2022 How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. \u2022 I HOPE SNAPE DIES.\u2022 DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????\u2022 Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.\u2022 Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. \u2022 HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.\u2022 Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.\u2022 So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.\u2022 I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. \u2022 Not shipping that. ^^\u2022 Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years.

The Voldemort origins, the Dumbledore/Harry business, Draco's mission, the Snape reveal, and the moment the trio decide to not return to Hogwarts so they can stop Voldemort once and for all.

I was expecting this installment to be mainly filler to get us to the Deathly Hallows, but so much happened here that I must have forgotten from the movie. The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series. ", "I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?", "Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouThis is DEFINITELY one of my top favorite books in the series. Shit just gets so real.My thoughts:-Dumbledore is so FREAKING sketchy in this book! He's so secretive, and he's always sneaking around, not explaining anything to Harry.-I'm always so proud of Fred and George for getting their own joke shop... I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom.-ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY. THE GAUNT HOUSE. OMG. I literally need a whole book about Tom Riddle's life. That would make me happy.-While reading this book, there were about a hundred times when I was just amazed by irony at the whole Snape/Half-Blood Prince situation. (Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it!-\"Tom used to collect trophies,\" said Dumbledore, \"This will be important later.\" WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN? COME ON MANNNNN.-the fact that Voldemort went back to Hogwarts to ask for a job just.... is hilarious to me. I'm picturing a sort of weird looking Tom Riddle like \"plz. im evil but i luv hogwartz\"-when you find out that the Defence Against the Dark Arts job is actually cursed *thumbs up*-\"I love you, Hermione.\" RON ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS. HE SAID THEM AND MY HEART SANG. He meant it in a friendly way but Hermione definitely loved hearing it.-Harry and Ginny are both so sassy and I love it when they become sassy together <3-at the end when Hagrid said something along the lines of \"Dumbledore will be able to fix it\" right after Harry saw him die.... Saddest thing ever.This book and its movie are definitely up there on my favorites list.", "I\u2019m yet to mention one of the most important characters in this series in a review. I\u2019m, of course, talking about Severus Snape.Severus, the unsung hero. Severus, who sacrificed his own soul. Severus, who loved another more than life itself. Severus, the half-blood prince- the truth about his character was, and will likely always be, one of the most surprising twists I\u2019ve ever read in fiction. The set up is all in this book. ", "\u201cI am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.\u201dHarry Potter is my life. My life is Harry Potter. Once again there are so many great and amazing scenes and quotes pressed between these pages, so much truth and emotion. How could it not fall for it again and again and again.Some of my favourite scenes (in no particular order):-Fleur and Mrs. Weasly falling into each others arms crying (just thinking about it makes me teary)(but no, really: Fleur is such an amazing and slightly underrated character. She lives with the Weasleys, where, honestly, no one makes it easy for her. Molly is fighting a constant battle with her but Fleur doesn't back off. Everyone is convinced she is vain and arrogant, but it's that moment in the hospital wing where - finally - these two amazing women recognise each other as equals, where Fleur gains acceptance and much more than that: respect. Everyone expected her to leave Bill for selfish reasons, no one expected that she really, truly loves him. But by proving that she would stand by him, whatever might happen - and everyone knew bad things were going to happen - she opened Molly's eyes and Molly saw her, for the first time, for what she really was. A strong and fierce woman and wife, as she was herself.)-the Memories: Dumbledore at the orphanage, Tom Riddle visiting Hepzibah Smith and Voldemort coming to ask for the DADA teaching job.-\"The Other Minister\" is one highly interesting and funny chapter.-Dumbledore's visit at the Dursley's-Utter silence before Hermione accidently punches herself with a telescope.-Ginny finally getting more spotlight, being the sassy and talented witch she is-Hermione pretending to go out with Cormac just to make Ron mad-\"I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,\" said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past, smirking.-Ron's love potion episode-Harry unknowingly discovering you-know-what while hiding his Potions books in the Room of Requierement.-Professor Trelawney actually predicting the right stuff just to dismiss it as rubbish-\"This is Mr Dumberton- sorry, Dunderbore. He's come to tell you - well, I'll let him do it.\"There are some scenes however, that I do not like to read, where I have to stop myself from skipping them. Firstly, the dreadful second Quidditch match, secondly the Sectumsempra scene with Malfoy and Snape, thirdly Dumbledore suffering in the Cave. They are not very enjoyable.Something that will forever annoy me is how absolutely no one believes Harry's Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory. He keeps telling Ron and Hermione about it but they ignore him.And then again, do you really expect me to believe that the brightest witch of her age would only get and \"Exceeds Expectations\" on her Defence Against The Dark Arts O.W.L.? Nope. Doesn't make sense. Especially not after Dumbledore's Army.In a nutshell: I love Harry Potter.

'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' \nI'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book \u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\nPHLEGM\n I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD \nRon and Hermione\nI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. \nHarry And Ginny\nhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... \nDumbledore's death\nI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!

contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of \u2019em. If you\u2019re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn\u2019t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends:https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead.

I'd also forgotten about most of the funeral. I'll say no more, spoilers oblige.What this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers, grammarians etc will place so many books above Harry Potter #6, none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as Potter lore.To me this series is special.

Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that\u2019ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  \u201cIn fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\u201d  \u201cPeople find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\u201d  \u201cIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\u201d   \u201cWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic.

Enjoy! <3", "Here's the thing about the Harry Potter books...They're awesome.Deep, huh? Well, deep or shallow, it's the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings' wands and run around shrieking, \"I have a Harry Potter stick!\"In other words, we all enjoy it.I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it's a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\"\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\"\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\"\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you.", "\n\u201cIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\u201d\nThis brought my right back to my 14-year old self, who was cooped up in bed, shedding tears for the first time over a book, because of the ending. I remember how I lay in bed, I remember the sun shining through the blinds and how wounded I felt that we lost one of the greats. This still remains my favourite in the series alongside Deathly Hallows. I\u2019m glad this series has resonated with me for so long, is still stuck with me and will continue to do so always. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014I read this many times when I was younger.

Buddy-reading with two questionable characters: Snape\u2019s wife and his brother. \ud83d\ude2c", "4.5 Golden StarsProbably the most Hilarious book of HP; I was rolling on the floor most of the times of laughter! by Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness.\u201cOh, she was perfect, obviously,\u201d said Ron, before Hermione could answer. \u201cPerfect Deliberation, Divination, and Desperation or whatever the hell it is...\u201dI mean, you know the 3 Ds here right?if you don't, just know: it's Definitely not \"Divination\" or \"Desperation\"! XDDon't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end.in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading this one for the first time. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him. though now after many times re-read I actually find funny parts in it.)yelling many times at these kinds of parts:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!btw, he is my favourite character.\ud83d\udc94at the end, he was right tho.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs (like the Slug club; truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his-students... ughhhh). Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying (not a high peak) & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at a grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (book 1, 4, 5) or something as fascinating as these. they were just attending their classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. XDbut in total, other parts, except Malfoy & Slug club; maybe not peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:\u2764 sassy Harry was the best! :DThere's no need to call me \"sir\", professor.Bless you JKR.Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass master!my first reaction when I see this, was: \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (\"Hail Harry Potter!\") & burst out laughing!\"Well, you can\u2019t break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)\"I\u2019d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!\u201dalthough there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Draco, but this book had many funny moments by many characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.don't forget Ron making funny moments too.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke because laughing so hard!\"and I'll take his secret to the \u2014\"  \"\u2014 not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\"LOL a lot!\u2764 FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"  \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014\"  \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I!?\"Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.\u2764 my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\", \"the lightning-struck tower\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how Harry unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.\u2764 at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\"(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(\u2764 & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry!

So he could read a novel about alien demon things.\nMy soulmate!I am going to share this again closer to publication, but after my experience with The Kiss Quotient and how it quite literally changed my life, I just couldn't wait to read this. And I gave a lot of thought to my rating. Five stars for a cute smutty romance? Really? But these books are very special to me and I think, deep down, they are actually a lot more than cute smutty romances.The Bride Test is about Khai, Michael's cousin in The Kiss Quotient. He is Vietnamese-American, autistic, and believes himself to be incapable of the emotions that matter. Like grief. Or love. His overbearing but lovable mother decides to take action and find him a wife from Vi\u1ec7t Nam. That's where Esme Tran comes in. After getting pregnant young, she now desperately tries to support her daughter in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City. She's mixed race, and has long wanted to go to America to find her father. When C\u00f4 Nga offers to pay for her visa and trip to California in exchange for her trying to seduce Khai, she takes the opportunity. Khai and Esme are fully-fleshed out and adorable characters. Khai is geeky and obsessive, but as we would expect from an ownvoices author, it does not come across in a faux-quirky way. His struggles and passion for his few interests are so genuine. Qu\u00e2n is also a real source of hilarity in this book; the dynamic between him and Khai makes for some very entertaining parts.On the surface, Hoang has returned once again to sexual and romantic relationships where one character is autistic. Khai is not a reincarnation of Stella from The Kiss Quotient but is very much his own person, and ASD affects him in unique ways. Esme must respect his boundaries, just as falling for her is a learning experience for him. The way these books bring sexiness to consent and mutual respect is wonderful. And HOT.But I said \"on the surface\" because there's more to this story as well. Trust me when I say the author's note is an absolute must-read. The Bride Test is a sweet, cute, sexy and funny romance, but it is also the story of an uneducated Vietnamese immigrant coming to the United States. This aspect is loosely-based on Hoang's mother's experiences, and it is the tale of an incredibly brave woman defying the odds and clawing her way up from almost nothing. Helen Hoang is making important waves, one sweet sexy romance novel at a time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YoutubeARC provided in exchange for honest review \ud83d\udc8d", "ARC provided by Berkley in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\u201cIt felt too big. At the same time, it didn\u2019t feel like enough.\u201d\n\nThe Bride Test is the most anticipated sophomore novel from Helen Hoang, AKA: the goddess who we do not deserve and who gifted us The Kiss Quotient! And this book is following a couple of characters who we originally met in that debut! I didn\u2019t love this installment as much as I did The Kiss Quotient, but I still think that this book is a treasure and that Helen Hoang is a gift to the world.And like The Kiss Quotient, this is an ownvoices novel, Helen is Vietnamese and is Autistic. And one of my favorite things about this book is seeing the difference of Stella, from The Kiss Quotient, and the main character of this book\u2019s Autism. I think people just like to group marginalized people together and act like their experiences are all the same, and this author does such a wonderful job at truly showing the Autism spectrum and how vast it truly is. This book has a completely different Autistic main character, because everyone\u2019s experiences are different, and I truly loved it more than I have words to express in this review. \u27bd Khai Vietnamese, Autistic, Michael's cousin from  The Kiss Quotient, living in California, and completely happy being on his own, especially after losing someone very close to him when he was younger. Even though that loss has made him think that he is incapable of love. \u27bd Esme - Biracial (Vietnamese and white), living in Vietnam as a cleaning woman, when Khai\u2019s mom travels there to try to see if she can find a woman who would be compatible with her son. And Esme accepts because she is a single mom, living in poverty with her own mother and grandmother, and she thinks this is an opportunity to give them and herself a better life. Khai\u2019s mother promises her a summer in California, where she can see if she can make Khai fall in love with her and marry her, but if not, she will return back to her family. But with this set up, the power imbalance always is at the forefront. I always was questioning Esme and her feelings, because she has so much at stake. Also, Esme doesn\u2019t tell Khai about her daughter for far too long, and that also felt extremely bad to me. And it\u2019s always hard for me to root for a romance that is founded on a power imbalance and then also have it harboring such a big secret, especially after the two individuals are choosing to have sex. Now, I will say that the author does such an amazing job at putting consent at the forefront of this story constantly, yet I still could never find my footing on this shaking ground. And because of this, I can\u2019t give this more than four stars. I will say that, besides always putting consent at the forefront, this story has a lot of other amazing elements. Like, just seeing Esme in a foreign country, doing whatever it takes to make a better life for her loved ones, and seeing her getting the education of her dreams, I am soft and so happy. My favorite part of this book was easily the acknowledgements, where Helen really shares about her personal life and her mother\u2019s personal experience being an immigrant and coming to American in search of a better life. I shed so many tears at how beautiful and powerful these final words were, and it truly was the cherry on an already amazing ice cream sundae. Also, much like The Kiss Quotient, the family in this book is everything. Quan plays such a major roll in this story, and honestly was the shining light for me. And I am counting the days until we get his book next! But this is a story about loss and love, yet also healing and becoming the person you want to be, no matter the circumstances. We get to see both Khai and Esme dealing with their own traumas, and healing separately, but we also get to see them building something really beautiful together; a future where they can be accepted and happy. And seeing them realize they were worthy of that love and acceptance all along? So damn beautiful. \n\n\u201cMy heart works in a different way, but it\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\nOverall, I just love being in Helen Hoang\u2019s world. From the important elements and themes, to the beautiful diversity and inclusion, to some of the steamiest and most romantic scenes ever, these books are just really easy to fall in love with. I hope she never stops writing, and I hope Berkley signs her for five more books after these five, because she is a gift to the world.

As opposed to many other readers, I personally enjoyed The Bride Test much more than its predecessor. Hoang continues to be inclusive with a high-functioning autistic primary character. Subtle education about this amazing population shatters ignorant stereotypes as we witness internal processing, growth, and love. Yes, love. Doesn't it look and feel different to us all regardless of so-called limitations? A theme related to immigration in this book shows true limitations and puts things in perspective. \n\n\"How did you change your life when you were trapped like this?

They didn\u2019t know. And she had no way to show them without an opportunity.\"\n\n Well-done, again, Ms. Hoang. This will be a re-read for me for sure.

This generosity did not impact my honesty when rating/reviewing.Source: Edelweiss+Author: Helen HoangPublisher: Berkley Publishing GroupOn Sale Date: May 7, 2019Note: All quotes were checked against the final, published edition.", "I like Helen Hoang\u2019s writing and how she writes romantic stories about different kinds of people. I loved loved loved The Kiss Quotient and had high hopes for her second novel. Overall, The Bride Test is fun. Hoang is a great storyteller. I loved the characters she created here. Khai, Esme/M\u00ff were compelling as were their families. The sexy parts were sexy. There were interesting tensions throughout the novel. Esme was a particularly admirable character because she had a clear sense of self and what she deserves. Very refreshing to see that in a romance novel. At times the story did falter with narrative threads that were not fully fleshed out and then the ending comes so fast and everything wraps up a bit too neatly. All that said, I highly recommend this book. It\u2019s a fun read with substance and great writing. ", "\nA romance with characters that express so much more than just physical attraction, but also grasps the heart of the reader with the tender emotions that are portrayed...\nOnce this beauty landed in my hands, I knew that there was no backing down of putting everything to the side and start it. That's what Helen Hoang does to you once you get a small glimpse of her writing. I remember last year how hesitant I was about reading The Kiss Quotient because of all the hype and love it kept getting. When it comes down to novels that are hyped too much, I like to back away from them and maybe read them in a month or so once the hype calms down. Thank the heavens I didn't, because I would have never encountered upon Helen's marvelous and unique way of putting so many in depth emotions to the page. I would have never gotten to understand, that even individuals whom may be different in some way, socially, physically, emotionally... anyway. There is still a fighting chance of finding love, cherishing that love, and grasping it for dear life. That's what Khai has demonstrated in this compelling romance novel that will have you running for more tissues.In my reviews, I really don't like to talk about the story plot of the characters. I like to focus on the way the story plot comes to be and how it changes my mind and mood. Helen does so by implying this new character, in which we came across in The Kiss Quotient during Stella's and Michael's story. Khai. That intriguing and mysterious autistic young man, that had picked my interest from that small glimpse we got of him. His way of living is structured, has a routine that he follows every single day and should not be tempered with. From the point of view of his family such as his mother, brother Quan (whom shall be brought up in a moment), and his sister Vy (whom shall also be brought up in a moment...) he is a simple man who enjoys his lifestyle as an accountant, takes his shoes off once he arrives to his two bedroom home and enjoys the feeling of his old carpet against his feet. It's the little things that one would not be able to understand why they are so important in which in that unique side of him, his extended family never understands. Emotions is something that Helen touches a lot when it comes to Khai. He does not come to a realization that, even though he states he cannot comprehend emotions in general; anger, happiness, sadness, disappointment, and love\u2014he truly is a strong human being whom expresses all those feelings.That's when M\u1ef9, aka Esmeralda, aka Esme comes along. A twenty-three year old young lady from Vi\u1ec7t Nam whose dreams had to take a pause because life came in the way. Supporting her mother, grandmother, a special someone who shall not be named for the sake of spoilers, is what M\u1ef9 had been doing before she encountered upon Khai's mother whom was looking for a bride for him. She is instantly drawn to M\u1ef9 and offers for her to come to the states for the summer and try to seduce her son, Khai. M\u1ef9 of course has to think about it because she has to support her family. But after a very thorough decision, she decides to accept the offer and goes to the states to try and make Khai fall in love with her.At first, meeting Esme with the circumstances he was put in by his mother, is not something Khai is pleased with. She moves in with her, but he is also instantly drawn to her natural beauty. Her eyes captivate him in the best of ways, making his body react in ways that have never acted before. The attraction is there and it's beautiful to read that a gentleman such as Khai, whom does not believe he can ever love anyone, expresses these feelings towards Esme;\n\n \"Strange, incomprehensible, beautiful woman. She said the funniest things and smiled all the time. His fingers itched to touch that smile, and he sipped away out of self-preservation...\" \n\nWeeks pass and Esme and Khai learn how to adequately be with each other. That does not stop Khai's body from acting in a non-gentleman way of course. Which I find so endearing to read from the third point of view. He knows he cannot deny that attraction, but he also knows that he shouldn't act upon it;\n\n \"She was already a song that payed on endless repeat in his head. If he started having sex with her, this thing would escalate into pure addiction, and what the fuck would happen when she left at the end of the summer?\" \n\nOnce feelings expand, that's when the struggles begin to form for Khai. Things take a turn when Esme comes across wanting to have a life in America, a life in which she can set as an example for her next in kin. Her dreams come back to life and want to expand and explore everything that is out there for the world to offer to her, but she knows that if she doesn't fight she will not get far. That includes Khai's love towards her as well.Overall, as previously mentioned... Helen has created a story that has truly gasped my heart and pierced it with her words. It made me cry, made me giggle, and made me swoon over the love and admiration Khai has towards M\u1ef9. Stories such as this one are not found very often and that's why they need to be cherished in the best of ways. Thank you so much to Berkley for being so generous with this advance copy. And as previously mentioned, Quan and Vy better come next. Vy's story should be mysterious to read because we really don't know much about her. But Quan however... **sighs** he is the rugged brother, with sexy tattoos that will have me drooling over him once Helen writes his story... that's IF she does it... **wink wink Helen Hoang**ARC galley kindly provided by Berkley in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Blog \u2655 Instagram \u2655 Facebook \u2655 Twitter", "\nreading the romance finalists for the 2019 goodreads choice awardsbitch i am WEAKhelen hoang's writing makes the upstairs and the downstairs damp if u catch my drift ok i'll see myself out\n", "Helen Hoang is becoming such an important part in my own bookish world to me. She writes romance stories that matter, that have substance, value and are a treat to read at the same time. This story was such a delight to read. There wasn't one part about this book that I disliked. I loved the characters and getting to know their backgrounds, why they were the way they were and how their circumstances shaped them. I couldn't get enough and I never wanted this story to end. I'm still craving for more.It was informative because my knowledge on autism is abysmal. But whilst I was reading about Khai I was learning about how he views the world and interacts with it.Esme is a mixed-raced girl who came to the US from Vietnam and seeing how she embraced and fought through the challenges of being an immigrant was so incredibly admirable.And then their love story started forming through all this... don't get me started. It was everything that it needed to be.I so appreciated that their actual Vietnamese names were used, how the culture was infused because it brought such authenticity and realness to the story and its characters. It was their truth.I want more of these types of novels. More of these types of stories told and Helen Hoang is really setting the standard for this.Just a side note, the Author's Note is just as valuable as the actual story. I think we tend to skip this a lot, but this adds such great insight to why Helen Hoang wrote this book. It was moving.--------------------Look what has arrived on me kindle! Guess what I'll be doing at work?", "my initial reaction after finishing this was to gush about how cute the story is. i love, love, love the diversity of characters and the autism representation. i absolutely adore khai with every fibre of my being and seeing him grow was such a rewarding feeling.that being said, i couldnt ignore a tiny nagging poke at the back of my brain. after taking some time to think about it, im not quite sure i adore this as much as i thought i did. i still love khai and i think his character is someone who desperately needs to be written in the book world, but its how everyone else acted towards him that i didnt like. i felt like they were being extremely manipulative when it came to khais feelings and getting him to marry. i get that sometimes people need an external push to get them out of their heads, but i thought the story tried to showcase that manipulation in a positive, if not loving, way? i dunno. im kind of conflicted about it. might change the rating back to 4 stars if i decide its not as problematic as i currently think it. :/\u21a0 3.5 stars", "Ugh. No. Not for me.So many issues, so little time.  I appreciated the author\u2019s note at the end. I\u2019ll just leave it that. I received an ARC of this book from Edelweiss and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.", "Helen Hoang has done it again! Similarly to The Kiss Quotient, this perfectly balances a mix of charming romance and deeper topics and I loved the heck out of it. The only thing that really kept me from giving this a full 5 stars was the weird power imbalance between Khai and Esme. I never doubted them or their feelings for each other, but it did just feel a little weird as a reader knowing the stakes and the secrets that were being kept behind the scenes. With all that being said I still HIGHLY recommend y'all check this out and I cannot wait to read a million more books from Helen in the future!", "I am not going to up this to 5 stars. I mostly agree with my old review - this book needs about 100% more smut in it. And this time around the whole immigrant story line made me extra anxious and sad (Even though I find that immigrant experience here is portrayed in a sugar-coated way. It is 10 times harder to get through the process in real life. Been there, done that.)Another thing is, this novel made me real thirsty for Quan's book, with 7 MORE MONTHS OF WAIT LEFT. Story of my life... Original reviewMore serious, less smutty, equally sweet, compared to The Kiss Quotient.So, mail-order bride scenario in romance is not exactly my idea of a good time. (And neither was a male escort one in The Kiss Quotient). But what Helen Hoang undoubtedly has a talent for is creating characters that are kind and empathetic. Esme is recruited by Khai\u2019s mom to seduce and marry him, so that he finally can have someone to be with. He is on the spectrum, and isn\u2019t good at relationships, for obvious reasons. Now, this can go wrong in many ways, but Khai\u2019s mom is super nice and truly believes Esme is the best match for her son. Esme isn\u2019t exactly a seductress, but a goofy girl with a big heart (and some mistakes in her past). And Khai believes himself incapable of feeling emotions.I feel like The Bride Test is a weightier, more serious work. Hoang draws on her parents\u2019 immigrant past, adding a big dose of realism to this romance, but not exactly going all the way there, it is a smutty romance after all. Esme and Khai\u2019s personal journeys are more real too, and so are their problems.I liked The Bride Test a lot, and inhaled it in a matter of hours. I didn\u2019t like it quite as much as The Kiss Quotient, because apparently I like fantasy scenarios more than real ones. And I clearly prefer a lot of smut too. Esme and Khai\u2019s relationship is a steamy one, but I would have preferred it... even more so. The book has the sexiest haircut scene though. It\u2019s amazing how arousing a conversation about boundaries and sensory sensitivity can be! @.@ And when Khai and Quan and Michael are in a different scene together, it\u2019s a total riot! You are in for a treat.Now, more wait for the next Helen Hoang romance. I don't know what it is yet, but I hope it\u2019s Quan\u2019s turn.", "Many thanks to Berkely for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest reviewThis is one of my favorite books that deals with mental illness! To see the others and to here me ramble about my brain, watch my video, A Brief Trip Inside My Mind!-------------------\n\nEveryone deserved to love and be loved back. Everyone. Even her.\n\nIs this what heaven is like? For the first time in -Checking... - six months, my little shriveled soul got a little less shriveled. This book grabbed my heart, tied it to a fan and took it for a wild and emotional ride that left me feeling tired yet happy.\nSo, what\u2019s this book about?\nThe Bride Test follows Esme, a Vietnamese young woman who is brought from Vietnam to the United States by a woman who is trying to find a wife for her son. Esme only agrees to come because she wants to get a citizenship there so she can properly take care of her daughter and mother. She spends her time trying to seduce and flirt with Khai who admently is not having it. But, bit by bit, he starts to fall for her. \u2660 Esme - Esme is a biracial (White/Vietnamese) woman who lives in Vietnam. She is just a simple cleaner who is trying to make ends meet for her and her daughter, Jade. Until a strange woman gives her a even stranger proposition. She wants Esme to come back with her to the United States to marry her son but I\u2019ll go into that --plotpoint later. Now, I\u2019m not 100% sure that Esme is autistic because it is never explicitly said so even though it is implied. (Edit: It was said that Khai is the one with Autism and somehow I missed that. Whoops!) I\u2019m really glad that more and more books are being published that are breaking down the walls of stigma around autism and mental illness in general. Something people can forget is that having Autism doesn\u2019t mean your broken, it just means your different. I have severe ADD/ADHD but I am (as my family has said) very smart. My brain just works in a different way. Autism or not, I absolutely loved Esme. She was just so bubbly and snarky. If anyone was a human incarnation of a sparkler, Esme would be it.[image error]\u2660 Khai - Khai was so attractive yet so f**king infuriating at the same time. He \u201chas no feelings\u201d which is, in fact, a part of the way his autism works. Now, I am not belittling the pain of those who struggle with depression or autism. I had a bout of depression for about six months but I was lucky enough to find a medication that helped. Therefore, I know how painful it is to feel nothing which is why I was so frustrated by Khai\u2019s antics. The fact that he was so, well, stupid about his own feelings was just. Ugh. In spite of that, I did not hate him. No, I related to him so much that it made my heart hurt. I know exactly what it\u2019s like to push people away. Not only for self protection. Some people see antisocial people as selfish when they\u2019re usually trying to protect others. Khai, like me, is so afraid that he would hurt other people that he just pushes them away and, ironically, ends up hurting them. If there was ever any human who deserved a hug and a good therapist, it\u2019s Khai.I think that one of the best parts of Helen Hoang\u2019s writing is that each book has an integration of mental illness, specifically Autism. Now, I don\u2019t have much Autism so it was a pleasant surprise to learn a little more about it. I do wish that the topic had been delved into a little more as I suspect that I am probably somewhere on the spectrum and it would have been helpful to here about it from someone who has experienced it for a while.But the romance was the selling point for me. I really enjoyed the relationship between Esme and Khai. Mainly, because it was so dynamic and realistic. They were constantly switching back and forth between hatred and love; lust and disgust. Even though it did feel a bit insta-lovey, I really enjoyed it.I think one of the biggest things from The Kiss Quotient and The Bride Test was the sex scenes. Everyone was so pleasantly surprised by the hotness and intimacy of them. I was no exception. I have read my fair share of romance but I was not prepared for all the details that were shared in this book. Admittedly, I wasn\u2019t a fan, at first. Partly, because I\u2019m gay and straight stuff sex scenes just aren\u2019t enjoyable for me but also because it made me feel very uncomfortable. I am able to enjoy steamy scenes when they\u2019re just male/male but for some reason, when there is a woman mixed in, it just makes me feel awkward. That said, I did get used to them but still didn\u2019t overall enjoy them. But for those of you who do, this book is for you.One thing I want to note really quickly is one of the main plot points. I don\u2019t mind enemies-to-lovers romance. I don\u2019t mind meet cutes. But what I can\u2019t stand is manipulation. I really hated how Khai\u2019s mother basically forced him into something he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. She was so intrusive and rude it just drove me crazy. Finally, I just loved the raw emotion this book made me feel. I was either laughing, crying or sobbing the entire time.

He doesn't feel things like others and believes he is incapable of the emotion required for love. Khai's mother wants nothing more than to see her son married, even if it means going to Vietnam and finding his future bride herself! Esme (My) is a hardworking, single mother who only wants to provide the best for her family. At her mother's urging, she accepts the offer to spend the summer in California with the intention of seducing Khai into marrying her. Oh, how I loved the unfolding romance between Khai and Esme! I found myself smitten by them and was solidly rooting for them as a couple. Yes, I am not at all embarrassed to admit I am firmly #TeamKhaiandEsme! Hoang does such an amazing job of fleshing out her characters. They are flawed, genuine and each undergoing an emotional journey. I was genuinely invested in these characters and their story. I found myself desperately wanting Khai to realize that he is so much more than this autism. I was rooting for Esme to find her way, feel proud of who she is and see all she can become. And I may have become a tad smitten with Quan, Khai's older brother. I'm hoping we see more of him in a future story. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and then I read the author's note at the end. It added even more depth for me to the overall emotion of the story. Don't skip it! As I wait for Quan's story to hopefully come to life - I'll be going back to read The Kiss Quotient. I might be one of the few people that hasn't read it but I plan to remedy that soon Helen Hoang! \ud83d\ude09", "ok, so despite my average rating, this book was actually super cute!Last year I was fortunate enough to receive an ARC of The Kiss Quotient\u00a0by Helen Hoang. It was enjoyable and cute and oh, so unique. Never had I read a book from the point of view of a character on the autism spectrum. To be honest, its something I never even thought about, especially not when it came to romance novels. I really do wish that more authors take that POV into account in the future as it was definitely an interesting read.Now, Hoang has given us a new book, set in the same world, with yet another set of wonderful charcters and I was so excited to read it.I am not going to go much into the plot, as I'm sure the synopsis covers that, so I'm just going to tell you all the things I loved and didn't love so much. First, I love these new characters. Khai is the autistic character in this novel and I loved him! He was nothing like Stella in The Kiss Quotient, showing how not everyone with Asperger's syndrome is the same. I often feel like authors represent certain peoples in a shallow and stereotyped manner. Thankfully, as an ownvoices author, Hoang has a wonderful and insightful understanding of ASD that gives depth and originality to her characters.Esme was also a fun character although I admit there were times when I questioned how fast she was moving in this relationship. That though is more a problem in the plot, and I will get to that later.Quan, Khai's brother, was awesome and I hope the next book in this series is about him! C\u00f4 Nga was also great, I thought she was going to turn out to be a horrible person, as future mothers-in-laws usually are in novels, but she was actually really sweet and caring. Generally, everyone was great. I only wish we would've had a longer Stella and Michael cameo!Overall, the book was fun and cute and made me laugh on several occasions. The characters were likable and Khai was honestly a sweetheart in his own unique way, and it was all great. I read the book in one afternoon and I wasn't able to put it down. And yet, I only gave it three stars.There was something in this book that I wanted and that it didn't quite deliver. The romance was cute, but everything else seemed off to me. Things were either too convenient or only put in place for the sake of tension. The book also felt a bit predictable. And yes, I know that romance novels are pretty predictable by nature, there are only so many places the book could have gone, but still. I expected more.The other issue was the dynamics of the relationship. Sometimes it felt rushed. Other times it felt as if there was no base to it. How well did these character really know each other? The book takes place over one summer and it's not like the two spend that time getting to know each other all that well. I couldn't quite fall into their story the way I wanted. I was lacking a genuine connection with the characters and the story overall.In the end, I still do recommend this book. It's a quick and entertaining story from a pov we never get to see. The moment it ended I wanted to keep going and see where else the story was going to go. I also can't wait for book three to come out. Hopefully, we finally get to see Quan's story!**ARC was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Along with almost everyone who read The Kiss Quotient I have been anticipating this book for a year. After loving Helen Hoang's first book I was super hyped for her next work AND IT SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS!!Esme is struggling in Vietnam to support her family. They rely on her and when the opportunity to go to America is presented \u2014 by a woman who is desperate to find a good Vietnamese girl for her son \u2014 at first Esme is strongly apposed but it is not an opportunity she has the luxury to decline. Khai has autism and has spent his whole life believing that he is incapable of love. And as such has refrained from any kind of romantic or physical relationship. When Esme comes to live with him for the summer Khai is uncomfortable with someone in his space, changing things around the house and making him feel things he is unaccustomed to.Now don't make the mistake of thinking that this is the simple plot of \u2018marriage for a green card\u2019. Esme has secrets and she's not one to rely on a man to secure her future. She is determined to earn her place and to make the most of her summer by learning as much as she can. I really enjoyed Khai's POV. His thoughts were so cute and innocent in a way. I'm a huge fan of autism reps so learning more about his autism was a real eye opener and so interesting. Guys the slow burn was real!! Is there anything better in a great New Adult novel? I loved that this is a spin off. It meant I got a sneak peak into the lives of Michael and Stella \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9cKhai and Esme hold a special place in my heart and I am most definitely going to reread this soon.ARC received in exchange for an honest review.__Pre-readI haven't even read this yet.

Oh my!Khai\u2019s mother is desperate to find him a wife. Khai\u2019s problem is not that simple \u2013 he is autistic and just has no interest in personal relationships. Well, time for MOM to step in! On a \u201cbride seeking\u201d trip to Vietnam, she crosses paths with a beautiful young woman working at the hotel. After a brief, but far from subtle conversation, she gives Esme a most interesting proposition. Come to America, and win over her loveless son by the end of the summer. If it works and all goes well, she will be blissfully married with a new life in America. Unsuccessful, Esme will return home to her simple life in Vietnam.Esme and khai\u2019s relationship was delightfully played out as they navigated each other\u2019s differences, while growing profoundly fond of one another along the way. Will Esme win khai over? Can she win her place deeply in the heart of someone who seemingly has no interest in love at all?My only reservation in reading this book was that there was a lot of sex talk. And I mean a lot!At times I think it took the emphasis away from the story itself. But for those of you who love the detailed steaminess in your romance book, (is it warm in here?) then you will be very happy with this one!A buddy read with Susanne that left us blushing at times!\u263a\ufe0fThank you to Elisha at Berkley Publishing, Edelweiss and Helen Hoang for an ARC to read and review", "4.5 stars.\"Khai didn't hurt. He felt nothing most of the time. That was exactly why he steered clear of romantic relationships. If someone liked him that way, he'd only end up disappointing them when he couldn't reciprocate. It wouldn't be right.\"Khai Diep is handsome, successful, a devoted son and brother. He has his routines and he likes everything in its place. He thinks he's broken because he doesn't feel emotions the way others do, and it has caused his problems. But his family knows it's just the way his autism manifests itself, and they want to help him because they know how special he is.Because Khai isn't interested in getting involved in a romantic relationship, his mother decides she needs to intervene. On a trip to Vietnam she meets Esme, a young, mixed-race girl working as a maid in Ho Chi Minh City, and is taken by Esme's beauty, her integrity, and her intelligence. She offers Esme the opportunity to come to America and live with Khai for the summer and attend a few family weddings with him, in the hopes that she can make him fall in love with her and decide to marry her. If not, she'll go back to Vietnam.While she is shocked at first about this offer, Esme realizes this is an amazing opportunity for a new life, for her and her family. Khai is handsome and kind, and she would love to marry him. But seducing him isn't as easy as she thought it might be. Although she is quickly smitten with Khai, he resists her advances even though he is immensely attracted to her. As he realizes that if he doesn't marry her, he'll lose her forever. But Esme wants it all, and won't settle for a marriage of convenience, no matter how much she has fallen in love with Khai.\"It wasn't loneliness if it could be eradicated with work or a Netflix marathon or a good book.

I adored the autistic rep, the steamy romance, the cultural discussions, and the promotion of female empowerment. Full review to come.\n", "I'll admit I was disappointed when I finished this one because I did enjoy The Kiss Quotient and had high hopes this would be a good read as well. Lack of good chemistry is the main issue I had with this book and why it was only an okay read. Once again the author has featured characters that are underrepresented in fiction which is awesome but given romance is such a big part of the story, the fact I wasn't really feeling it, was a significant problem. Other readers really connected with the characters so definitely this is one of those your mileage may vary type reads.This is the second book in The Kiss Quotient series but can easily be read as a standalone. Some characters from the first book make appearances in this one which was nice although some were \"don't blink or you'll miss it\" type cameos. It looks like a third book is in the works and after reading this one I have a pretty good guess who will be the main character. Even though this book wasn't my favorite, I still wouldn't mind checking the next book out.Esme Tran has lived her entire life in Vietnam and is working at a hotel when she is approached by a woman who has an interesting proposition. She wants Esme to come to America and marry her son. The prospect of a better life for not just her but also her family, is why Esme takes the woman up on her offer. But getting the son, Khai, to fall in love with her isn't going to be easy. I wasn't a huge fan of the premise to begin with as having a green card type plot doesn't seem like the best use of diverse characters. I wish the author would have chosen a different reason for Esme to come to America and interact with Khai. However, the author did attempt to give substance to the characters by featuring such things as Esme's drive to succeed and Khai learning how to deal with his emotions. Like I said before I wasn't feeling much chemistry between Esme and Khai and in general I thought the story needing some polishing up as it didn't quite work for me. It just felt like so many aspects of the story were not fully developed or not developed to their potential is maybe a better way of putting it. Everything felt slightly off with this book. It wasn't horrible, but I definitely walked away wishing I would have liked it better.Thank you to First to Read for the opportunity to read an advance digital copy! I was under no obligation to post a review and all views expressed are my honest opinion.", "I did not like The Kiss Quotient. I thought it lacked\u2026 life. Emotion. Vulnerability. Sweet romance. And I did not feel connected to the characters one bit. From what I remember, I didn\u2019t even push past the halfway point. That\u2019s how much I did not care.All that to say that I only gave this one a chance because I am a sucker for cutesy covers and can\u2019t help but give authors who have disappointed me in the past a second chance. As I admit this, I realize it applies to people in general, too, so now I\u2019m wondering if this is a quality or a weakness of mine. Regardless, I am elated I read this book that can be read as a standalone. No need to read The Kiss Quotient. Actually, I recommend forgetting it exists altogether and diving into this one right away. This story was much lovelier, romantic and humorous! I could one hundred percent picture everything on the big screen. I can\u2019t even decide who I love most between Esme and Khai. The two belong together, that is quite obvious, as they complement each other and I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t healthy to be jealous of fictional couples but alas I very much want what they have. They are so lucky to have been forced onto one another. Even if that sounds wrong. They are not, however, perfect. Esme\u2019s lies are annoying and her going along with that last mischievous plan was unbelievable. I saw it coming, tried to prevent it somehow with my mind, admitted defeat and witnessed everything unfold with disappointed eyes. I get why it happened. But still. If you\u2019re confused, well you should be because I don\u2019t want to spoil you. If you know what I\u2019m referring to, let\u2019s bang our heads together.

Khai however, doesn\u2019t want a wife. He doesn\u2019t feel things like others and has never felt love. Khai is autistic, dislikes being touched and doesn\u2019t really like being around people.

What I will say however, is that \u201cThe Bride Test\u201d made this girl right here Blush! Like OMG.. (I was not prepared!!) It contained lots of sexy thoughts and several \u201ccover my eye\u201d moments (which were severely embarrassing for ole\u2019 stick in the mud Susanne!). Though this novel was a little sexy for me, I really enjoyed the characters, especially Khai\u2019s brother Quan - fingers crossed that there will be another story featuring him!

After finishing The Kiss Quotient a week ago, getting approved for this arc was amazing. I started it right away. And, sadly, I realized it was going to be nothing like The Kiss Quotient.The Kiss Quotient characters had chemistry, whereas in this book, I felt like there was little-to-no chemistry. Obviously, that\u2019s my opinion and some of you will disagree when the book is released. But, I wasn\u2019t a fan.I\u2019ll write more when the book is released in May; I don't want to risk giving the plot away. Either way, I think many of you will like this story and I still recommend it to those who enjoyed The Kiss Quotient. I have a strong feeling I'll end up having the unpopular opinion, but we shall see in May!", " Right then and there, Khai decided green was his favorite color, but it had to be this specific shade of seafoam green.Story \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fMy never thought about anything bigger then living her life, working as hard as she can so she could see her daughter happy. Yes, she got pregnant pretty young. But she would do it again just so she could have her wonderful baby girl by her side.Then My meets a strange rich lady that searches a husband for her son - Khai. Even though My refuses, after talking to her family she gives it a try. Stay the summer, Khais mother said, and when it doesn\u2019t work out well, you can leave. But when My meets Khai she knows he\u2019s different, but after some time she starts to like it. The way he talks, the way he thinks. But Khai is Khai.

Oh, you guys, I found my new favorite book. \u2665\ufe0f(Sorry, it\u2019s still on Second Place, because nothing can beat the hating game) I was happy and smiling throughout the whole book (okay, maybe I was sad a few times) and i grinned like a crazy person while reading it. This is definitely a book that makes you happy and takes you away from reality for a few hours. It was funny, lovely, romantic, cute, sad and so so so so sweet. I can definitely recommend this to anyone that loved \u201ethe love quotient\u201c or \u201ethe hating game\u201c (hihi). Character \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f But now, a new dream formed in her heart, one she\u2019d never dared to encourage but wanted with breathless intensity: doing something she was passionate about, changing this world for the better, being more. She didn\u2019t even know what she was good at, but if she could explore and learn ... I don\u2019t even know who I love more... Khai, that is just so caring, quiet and intelligent or My - aka Esme - who was this lovely girl with a beautiful smile, honest and pure thoughts and the biggest and strongest heart of them all. Throughout the book we get to know those two cuties and with every page I read I thought how different we humans really are. We saw how Khai hurt or loved in his own kind of way. We saw how Esme was all of us - she changed her way of thinking like crazy. She thought she would get rejected and the next minute she thought she would get accepted. And it was always that way. Sometimes she thought the worst about a situation or a person and when it came true she was still devastated. And, i mean, aren\u2019t we all Esme sometimes? We hope and hope and hope and want it to be true but we also don\u2019t want to be sad when it comes out negative. And so we change between the positive and the negative outcome all the time and our feelings are so mixed. But I guess that is what makes us human? I really really loved to see how Khai and Esme were both so really relatable. Next to those beautiful human beings there are also all of the side characters, who helped those two evolve, develop and be happy together, even though they didn\u2019t realize it so fast.  Lonely was for people who had feelings, which he didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t loneliness if it could be eradicated with work or a Netflix marathon or a good book.

This romantic but steamy relationship between Esme and Khai was just so heartwarming and it made me so so happy. Yes, they were both so weird sometimes, but I loved this so much about them. Aren\u2019t we all a little weird sometimes? At least I am! And i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing. And the way the author showed Khais thinking, the process, his questions and oh so confusing feelings. It was fascinating and even though I don\u2019t know if it represents  people with autism good or bad - I thought it was so lovely to really see what he thought about what and whom.

It\u2019s probably this light, heartwarming, cute and funny writing that made me love these books so much. It was the POV of both of the main characters so we could see what their intentions were behind every step they took and behind every word they said. I literally flew through the book because It was so good and I even sneaked some pages into my work schedule, just so I could read a bit more. It brightened my mood when I was sad or angry and it made me smile all the time. This is definitely one of the books I will reread till the end of my life and I\u2019m so so happy my friend Warda recommended it to me.

It's like your heart is made of stone.'I always find it a little bit stressful to read the sequel of a book I loved, because there's so much pressure: what if the sequel isn't as good at the first book? Or what if it blows the first book out of the water and makes me rethink my entire rating system?! Because of that, it's pretty common for me to stall a bit when picking up a sequel, which is what happened with The Bride Test. I read the first 2 chapters, put it down for 2 weeks, and then read the rest of the book in one sitting. Go figure.\nBut something inside of him loosened, and he didn't mind so much the way she said his name now.\nUnfortunately, I did not love The Bride Test as much as I loved The Kiss Quotient, but it's still absolutely worth reading! Much like in TKQ, we've got a somewhat slow-burning romance between two people whose sexual chemistry is off the charts, but who can't communicate well enough to get past themselves and make it work. It's a blessing and a curse, because I love a good slow-burn romance, but sometimes these characters made me want to scream.\nShe would do anything for this little one. Except give her up.\nKhai's brilliant and amusing, but his stubbornness became a little cruel sometimes. Esme, I loved endlessly\u2014her wit, her determination, her intelligence, and the way she owned her sexuality\u2014with my only complaint being that I genuinely couldn't imagine living with someone for weeks and never once letting them know I have a child. As a mom, there were details to that whole scenario that were so frustrating, but they were a little easier to overlook only because the logical side of me knew she was doing it for Jade's own well-being in the long run.\nWhat a difference an ocean made.\nSigh. I feel like this review's a bit of a mess; while I genuinely did enjoy The Bride Test so much, putting my thoughts down on paper has me seriously considering all of the things I was disappointed by. I will give a caveat that the last 1/3 or so of this book is practically flawless and made me cry happy tears, but the more of this review I'm writing, the less I can justify anything above a 4-star rating. I'm very excited for the third book and I can't wait to spend more time with Quan, and I loved a lot of things about this book, but I'm a little bit worried nothing will be able to trump TKQ for me.All quotes come from an advance copy and may not match the final release.

Stone hearts didn\u2019t love.She knew why he couldn\u2019t love her. She could go to school, change her clothes, and change her speech, but she could never change where she\u2019d come from.I didn't think I could love Khai & Esme's story as much as Michael & Stella's, but I did! I'm officially fangirling hard over Helen Hoang! This was a story that I easily was swept away by. I completely lost track of time and obligations. That is what made this a phenomenal read for me.I don\u2019t know why but I really love when the romance doesn\u2019t come so easy for the main characters. When a character faces challenges that most people don\u2019t, it makes the journey infinitely more interesting. Khai is Michael\u2019s (from \u201cThe Kiss Quotient) cousin. He too, has Asperger\u2019s as Stella did from book one, but I would say they aren\u2019t on the same spectrum. Khai\u2019s mother goes off to Vietnam to find her son a bride. She worries that he will be alone for the rest of his life unless she steps in to play cupid for him. She meets Esme, by chance, and is so impressed by her that she offers her an all expense paid trip to San Francisco, where she will spend a couple of months trying to get close to Khai, which will hopefully end up with a wedding.While Khai and Esme may have come from two different worlds, they really do end up being true soulmates. Khai is set in his ways. Likes his routines. He doesn\u2019t think he needs a woman. Khai doesn\u2019t believe he has a heart, and this stems from tragic losses from his past. He\u2019s internalized a lot of his pain and having Asperger\u2019s, doesn\u2019t make it easy for him to understand his feelings.Esme comes from very impoverished conditions. She works as a hotel maid in Vietnam, to help support her family. Meeting Khai\u2019s mother and being offered a trip to San Francisco was almost too good to be true to Esme, but she has an honest soul and marrying someone just to get a green card to be able to stay in the U.S., was not something she could ever go through with. Her plan was to find her American father, who left Vietnam before she was born and gain citizenship that way. But, when she sees Khai for the first time, there is no denying her heart was beating for him. Poor Esme battles with insecurities. She thinks being poor and not having a college education, make her an unsuitable match for Khai.Their relationship starts off awkward but eventually strong attraction takes hold and Esme is falling hard for Khai, but he truly believes he is incapable of loving anyone else, and so the angst ensues. I loved the relationship between Khai and his older brother Quan, who was always there for his brother. He took it upon himself to help Khai maneuver through some challenges that he was not equipped to handle on his own. You can\u2019t help but root for this couple to find a way to overcome their challenges and end up in a happily ever after that they truly deserved. I was so sad when I got to the end of the story because I wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye to these wonderful characters.Here are my overall ratings:Hero: 5Heroine: 5Plot: 5Angst: 5Steam: 4Chemistry Between Hero & Heroine: 5THE BRIDE TEST releases on May 7th! I highly recommend it, and \u201dThe Kiss Quotient\u201d. Amazon: https://amzn.to/2Ufba4q", "This book was super cute. This story follows Khai (Michael\u2019s cousin from The Kiss Quotient) and Khai is on the autism spectrum and doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of feeling love. His love interest Esme is this Vietnamese woman his mother finds him and she arranges a marriage for them because she\u2019s afraid her son will never find anyone. So we get this amazing fake dating trope that I love, on top of Helen Hoang\u2019s adorable cute writing. I always really enjoy her writing - it\u2019s so fluffy and cute and makes my heart happy. I didn\u2019t like this book quite as much as The Kiss Quotient, but this book is still a really cute, fun time. I absolutely love Quan, Khai\u2019s brother. And apparently the next book in this series will be from his POV, which I am so excited for!!!! He\u2019s just the sweetest older brother to Khai and their relationship is SO SOFT.I also really loved Khai and Esme\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s the trope of the guy being super negative and pessimistic and her being really hopeful and bubbly and they just bring out the best in each other and it\u2019s real cute. I only knocked off a star because the ending kind of got melodramatic and there was some miscommunication and basically the same thing that happened in The Kiss Quotient. The ending was also very rushed and I felt like I needed more at the very end. But anyways, it was a cute story, well worth your time.", "\nI didn't love this one as much as the Kiss Quotient sadly but still overall really good book!\n", "\nOkay. Whom do I have to beg to have this book right in my greedy hands?I can do kneeling if required.I'm great at kissing feet too.

Her books consume me, make me fall in love, not just with characters but this authors writing more and more!!! The emotions, yep, this book you will definitely feel them. Laugh, smile, be angry, and cry real tears, but ohhhhhh soooooo worth it!! If you want to be swept away in a good book, a beautiful memorable romance, this is it!!

She works in a hotel as a janitor/maid. Her simple and meager lodgings at home are shared with her little daughter Jade, as well as her mother and grandmother. Esme's father is American, although she never met him. Her mother found herself pregnant after her American businessman lover went back to the states. The only remnants of his existence are an old picture and the fact that he was once a college student at Berkeley in California. History had a way of repeating itself, the way Esme and her Mom both became young single mothers.One day Esme is very diligently cleaning the hotel bathroom when she notices an upscale dressed older woman resting in the bathroom's adjacent sitting room. The woman strikes up a conversation with Esme that is a pivotal point in the story. This Vietnamese woman now lives in America, is a successful restaurant owner, and wishes to arrange a marriage to her youngest son, Khai. Khai is a very successful accountant, eminently handsome...but is autistic. This final piece of information is withheld from Esme for the time being. She offers Esme an opportunity she cannot refuse- to come to America for a few months to try and win her son over with the ultimate goal being marriage. Esme's mother convinces her to seize the opportunity as it will benefit her whole family if she succeeds. When we first meet Khai he is sitting in a funeral home where his best friend Andy is laid out. It becomes evident that he processes things differently from other people. While everyone else is crying and displaying behavior befitting mourning, Khai is stoic and completely unemotional. He is set apart from everyone else. He knows this. In fact, when he goes to weddings he keeps a paperback in his suit jacket pocket to read, either right at the table while everyone else is socialising, or will simply escape to some other room in the banquet hall to find his own reading solace. He has a rigid routine that he follows for each day. He owns his own home, but it's still sporting a green, deep shag carpet. The only room that was ever updated was the bathroom. He often wakes up to a morning boner, but he is a virgin. He just knows he's an emotional stone inside and wouldn't want to inflict that inability to love on anyone else. Then Esme crashes into his world and stirs up everything.She's very pretty and down to earth with a strong work ethic. No sooner is she thrust upon him then she's cutting down an unsightly tree with a meat cleaver (she's very industrious also), and climbing a ladder to clean the leaves out of his gutters. Khai doesn't know what hit him. He's constantly aroused by her, but trying to resist her charms. Without getting into too many more details, Khai is on a journey to discovering, understanding and embracing his emotional side. Esme is also growing as she learns English and her true potential in life. There were many comical situations that were truly delightful and refreshing. These mostly occurred during the onset of Esme and Khai's relationship. There were also numerous steamy sexual trysts, which were fun to read since Khai was ripe and ready but always resisting and denying his virginal self. My frustration set in a bit towards the end of the book with Khai's continual resistance to coming to terms with his love for Esme. For this reason, my initial joy and interest in reading the book slowly tapered into boredom until it finally reached a touching and perfect conclusion at the end. I usually read literary fiction, biographies, or historical fiction, so this work of contemporary romance was a light reverie for me, and the character of Esme was an appealing character."], "genre": ["Romance", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Adult", "Romance", "Contemporary Romance"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/60976615-the-bride-test", "avg_ratings": "3.92", "ShelvedNumber": "1900"}

Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves-and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time, she muses. After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is. Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545498817l/42135029.jpg", "title": "City of Girls", "authors": "Elizabeth Gilbert", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42135029-city-of-girls", "reviews": ["I just finish this book seconds ago - still soaking in the pool...,I can fully understand a wide range of reviews but truthfully I absolutely loved it.I still have tears in my eyes. I found the ending very moving....It was often an Audiobook HOOT! But also something much deeper...Vivian Morris is a women I\u2019ll remember. Review to come soon: I\u2019m Back.....UPDATE.....Audiobook....narrated by Blair Brown - FABULOUS READER!!! Kudos to Blair Brown!!!This is another book that I almost skipped because I saw low reviews by friends I respect - plus I\u2019ve had my own up and down issues about past book written by Elizabeth Gilbert. So far- I seem to have extreme thoughts about Gilbert\u2019s books - I either can\u2019t stand them - or I\u2019m \u2018over-the-hill\u2019 crazy in love with them. \u201cA Signature For Small Things\u201d, blew me away. Loved it!!! \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d....not so much. I cherish how I\u2019m feeling from this book. I\u2019m actually still digesting some of the essential insights. In my thinking - Gilbert has crafted a fulfilling and important path to understanding and healing ourselves and finding peace....She did this with dazzling storytelling- she didn\u2019t have to write a \u2018self-awareness\u2019 - or \u2018self help\u2019 book, to have us face our humility, courage, compassion, and wisdom, either. It took the entire book for me to grow into the deeper messages. Elizabeth Gilbert provided an opportunity for learning about ourselves. She does this by creating lead protagonist- Vivian Morris. Maybe I\u2019m the silly one - but for me - there was much more authentic spirituality in this book - naturally - than I experienced in Gilbert\u2019s book called \u201cBig Magic\u201d. The characters in this book live LARGE. The story itself is a huge sprawling chronicle - a life story about a lofty - supercilious - honest - and gracious character: Vivian Morris. She tells us several times that she is only good at two things: sex and sewing. NOT TRUE! I was able to see early on how gracious of a friend she could be- to both men and women. We meet \u2018the gang/ the family\u2019.....at the Lily Playhouse...vaudeville theater in New York City.....with colorful show girls & actors. It\u2019s a different era than today. Besides Vivian, - we\u2019ll meet Aunt Peg, Olive, Celia, British actress Edna Parker Watson - ( Star of the play called \u201cCity of Girls\u201d), Uncle Billy, Marjorie, Frank, and Angela Towards the end of the book - I was reminded of that powerful sentence I\u2019ve heard a few times in my life....\u201cBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle\u201d.Not a book for everyone...Read through many positive and critical reviews. There are many of both. Some words from critical reviewers:Too longBoringDidn\u2019t hold readers interest Too much sex Quirky charactersTrashSilly and predictable Self Indulgent Debauchery, sex, and alcohol Shallow fluffPositives words from readers:CaptivatingEntertaining Like a tray of Champagne cocktailsBetter than Harry PotterI couldn\u2019t put it downAll the feelsGreat female charactersChampions independenceWeeping and can\u2019t type A beautiful story A memorable storyNostalgicLots of sexLots of sexLots of sexGlitz and glamour Intoxicating by freedom & a scintillating lifestyle Thought provokingLife lived to the fullest Amazing characters For me it was full of heart, thought-provoking, funny, sad, animated with gorgeous vibrant lush language with a rich connection to acceptance, forgiveness,...and love. PS....I really did cry while sharing about this story with Paul. Sincerely moved at the end. ....and the message I took in", "Gilbert\u2019s narrator is an old woman named Vivian, looking back at herself as a naive 19-year-old who had just failed out of Vassar College. (She ranked 361 in a class of 362, surpassing only a girl who contracted polio.) Baffled by a daughter with no matrimonial or professional prospects, Vivian\u2019s parents send her off to an eccentric aunt who owns a crumbling theater in New York. Light-years from Broadway, Aunt Peg\u2019s Lily Playhouse offers cookie-cutter musical comedies written on the fly for working-class folk. Vivian has no interest in acting, but she adores fine clothes and she\u2019s a whiz with a sewing machine. Always on the lookout for talent, her aunt makes her the theater\u2019s costumer. And so what should have been a mere summer interlude became a whole life.Unfortunately, what should have been a mere 300-page novel became a 470-page tome. The best and worst thing that can be said about \u201cCity of Girls\u201d is that it\u2019s perfectly pleasant, the kind of book one wouldn\u2019t mind finding in a vacation condo during a rainy week. In exchange for a series of diverting adventures, it demands only stamina from its readers.Not that it\u2019s without charm. Gilbert definitely knows her way around the vintage dress shop. So many outfits are sharply described in these pages that rather than put this novel on a shelf, you should hang it in a closet. And she\u2019s got a good ear for the arch repartee of 1940s comedy. In the best passages, her witty dialogue sparkles like diamonds in champagne.But this is a story that takes a half-hour to travel a New York minute. And that leisurely pace pushes. . . . To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert...", "City of Girls is a genre-bending, uniquely-structured, light-hearted, deeply-profound kind of novel, whatever that means. I'm honestly still in awe of it. The first half has zero conflict and yet never fails to engage. I devoured every moment of being young and careless in 1940's New York, amid showgirls and theater personalities. This glorious fantasy is so enrapturing it doesn't matter if nothing goes wrong. In fact, I prefer it that way. Arguably, when the complications do show up, the novel peters out. Writers are constantly taught that conflict is everything, but in a way Gilbert proves the experts wrong. Perhaps, as the novel suggests of the 1940s, this is a sign of the times. When the world is conflicted enough, we prefer pleasure over drama. When the second half takes a more serious turn, it's a little disappointing. Everything was so wonderful! Why did you have to ruin it? The answer, of course, is that real life isn't all fun and feathers. Gilbert succeeds in the grittier sections by showing us that, even in the realm of adult consequences, it's possible to move beyond mistakes, be true to yourself, and ultimately live a fabulous life. Other than feeling a little long in places, I have no complaints. Full disclosure, I listened to the audio version which was so masterfully narrated that I have no doubt it enhanced the experience. Dancing through the streets of New York is a great distraction on the daily commute, but may struggle to demand my attention in bed after a long day. If anybody transitioned from book to audio, I'm curious to hear how the experience differed.", "At 51% I\u2019m done. I loved the voice and the writing but I\u2019m growing very weary of hearing about Vivian\u2019s sexual exploits. I loved the era and the setting. The audiobook narrator was incredible. But it wasn\u2019t enough to save this book for me. I\u2019m all for women owning their sexuality but by the halfway point I\u2019d like to see some growth and maturity. Promiscuity is not a step forward for women, it\u2019s a step backward.Vivian is rather a bore and this book is way too long given the subject matter. Moving on....I received an e-galley via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.", "Three joyful, glamorous time travelling to 40\u2019s, but travel time was too long stars!!! I really tossed around giving three to four stars, because I enjoyed the writing but not sure about the character development! I really enjoyed some parts so much! Having fun to learn Broadway theater life and scandalous, marvelous but also nasty, controversy backstage life of the show girls!As a narrator, I liked the old self of Vivian, she reminded me of a chatty grandma who has vivid imagination and sarcastic sense of humor. But as a young person who was good at only two things: sex and sewing! I found her a little spoiled, immature, careless, superficial. Not only for her approach about monetary matters( yes she was coming from healthy family, raised with servants but she never understood the difference between rich and poor! She also didn\u2019t use any effort to achieve at Vassar where too many young people on her age dream to be educated !), but also her addiction to sex and attitudes with lack of emotions, putting herself dangerous positions, taking nonsense risks for this addiction! Sometimes she even forgot that they\u2019re in the middle of war. ( Well at least I could say if she was living in 70\u2019s instead of 40\u2019s and her passion profession is PR instead of tailoring, she would be a great younger version of Sex and City\u2019s Samantha Jones!)After she got involved in a scandal, she went back to her hometown. Then with the help of her aunt, she goes back for working for war cause! At least she starts to head on something in her life involves more noble causes.What I really like about book is description of the life, struggles of wartime and glamorous Broadway comedy theaters era! I also liked the sarcastic and joyful tone of Vivian when she talks about her past! It was so funny to see her worst regret is not having more sex with men! She was really one of kind! I was really about to give four stars. But the things I disliked force me to cut points.I didn\u2019t like Vivian\u2019s a little narcissistic approach and seeing herself one and only star of her story. Because there is nothing she\u2019s achieved to be star of the story. I accepted her flaws, her resistance to grow up and seize the day, enjoy life selfishly! But still I wanted to say cut the point and give us something more real about life. Well, as you can see she didn\u2019t! And this book is really too long. It could be edited to 300 pages and we may enjoy more fast paced, gripping story! I was expecting too much! But still author\u2019s writing is creative, rich, entertaining.Maybe Eat, Pray, Love affected me so much so I was waiting for something more inspirational, emotional, heart-warming! That\u2019s why I'm a little disappointed!", "Before I start, I'd like to mention a few things Elizabeth Gilbert wrote at the beginning of the book, which attracted me to it, and also explains the book very well. She says:\"I've longed to write a novel about promiscuous girls whose lives are not destroyed by their sexual desires\" , then she introduces Vivian Morris, who's our narrator and the main character of this book. And Gilbert says: \"My goal was to write a book that would go down like a champagne cocktail- light and bright, crisp and fun.\" So she did :)This is a coming of age story of Vivian, a very likeable and vivid character. She's 19 when we start following her, a college drop out coming from a wealthy family. She moves to New York to live with her eccentric aunt Peg, who owns a theatre, and then, her adventures begin. We follow Vivian until she's very old. I can easily say, Vivian is a character you'd want to follow, you'd want to listen to her stories because she's very energetic, sassy, free and fun. \"I promise that I will try my best in these pages not to go on and on about how much better everything was back in my day. I always hated hearing old people yammering on like this when I was young. (Nobody cares! Nobody cares about your Golden Age, you blathering goat!) And I do want to assure you: I'm aware that many things were not better in the 1940s. Underarm deodorants, air-conditioning were woefully inadequate, for instance, so everybody stank like crazy, especially in the summer, and also we had Hitler.\"The book started very strong, I loved Gilbert's note, I loved Vivian right away. She was so ready to throw herself out in the world and welcome all the experiences that was thrown back at her. I think her attitude for life was a good reminder of 'life is short' and we mustn't forget to live it while we can. Gilbert gave so much life and energy to her characters that it really impressed me so much. They were all different than each other, all flawed, but amazing. Peg, uncle Billy, Edna, and many more. It was a parade of interesting people that we got to know so well. I just could picture all of them in front of my eyes, and I wished so badly I could transfer there to meet them.For me, the highlight of this book is definitely how real and how vivid Gilbert writes. It could be mistaken for a real memoir. \"I was long and tall, that's all there was to it. And if it sounds like I'm about to tell you the story of an ugly duckling who goes to the city and finds out that she's pretty, after all-don't worry, that is not that story. I was always pretty, Angela. What's more, I always knew it.\"Another thing is the historical time Vivian was in, 1940s. It wasn't an easy period, when there was the war. Again, I felt like I was transferred to those times to New York. The amount of detail Gilbert put in her descriptions were so imaginative. The way she described the dresses, the society, the theatres, the effects of war on people, was just impressive. I loved it! I wanted Vivian to be real so badly, I wanted her to be on TV so I could watch her telling her stories, even better, a friend so I could have coffee with her. It was also fascinating to watch her to get older and more mature. But, in any part of her life, she was interesting. I highlighted so many of her comments, and actually many more characters. In my opinion, there's one thing that could be better in this book. Sometimes the energy went down a bit too long, some periods that were rather un-eventful took more space than it should. But, it didn't decrease my love for the book :) But, all in all, I thought this book was fantastically written with interesting characters. Such vivid descriptions, a lot of energy, wit and wisdom. A surprise would pop out of the pages every now and then. In some ways, it reminded me of Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but don't get me wrong here. The stories aren't even remotely similar. But, the way I wanted Vivian to be real so much reminded me how much I wanted Evelyn Hugo to be real. Because they were so well written, captivating characters. I hope this was useful :)", "\n*desperately searches for the feather boa and the good champagne glass*UPDATE:Maybe I was too drunk on the sparkling water I drank from the champagne glass, but I actually got a bit lost in the story to the point when it kind of got boring. But I don't categorize it as a bad read. It was very open-minded and well-documented. Thank you, NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review!\n", "City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert is a 2019 Riverhead publication. This work of historical fiction spans several decades and follows the life of Vivian Morris. During the 1940\u2019s Vivian threw away a golden opportunity at Vassar College, which prompted her parents to send her to New York to live with her eccentric Aunt Peg. Aunt Peg owns a midtown theater and soon Vivian becomes enthralled with the thrill of live performances. She quickly strikes up a close friendship with a couple of the showgirls and from there, she embarks on a life of partying, scoring men, and falling prey to horrific scandal. Years later, Vivian receives a letter from a woman whose father was once close to Vivian, asking what the nature of their relationship had been. In her reply letter, Vivian regales the reader with her colorful life story and through her memories, she gains more understanding of her life and herself. I suppose that technically, this book could be categorized as an epistolary novel- although it is just the one letter, I suppose, and not a back and forth correspondence. Either way, Vivian, now well on in years, takes the reader on a long trip back down memory lane, which will eventually reveal the answer to the simple, yet complicated, question posed to her. This is my first book by Elizabeth Gilbert. That's right- I never read \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 which was a hot topic book at one time, or anything else written by this author. But, about this book-I had high hopes for this novel. I\u2019ve been on a long dry spell when it comes to historical fiction and hoped this one might be a nice change of pace from the current trends in this category. I did finish the book, but it was a struggle at times. Vivian\u2019s character, as funny as she could be sometimes, was too over the top with her casual promiscuity. I quickly grew tired of hearing about all her one -night conquests- which were too many to count. In fact, the entire first half of the book could have been paired down without lessening the overall impact of the story. There are emotional and poignant moments, but the story experienced some turbulence in execution, making it a bit of a bumpy ride. The landing, however, was flat and anticlimactic for me. It wasn\u2019t as stirring, or delightful, or profound as I had hoped it might eventually become. I would love to expound on why I feel this ambivalence towards the story, but in doing so I\u2019d reveal too much. It wasn\u2019t all bad, and it was enjoyable enough to make it worth my time and effort, but mostly I found it underwhelming. 3 stars", "\n1) Elizabeth Gilbert has an excellent publicist.2) Have sex and be happy.3) Nothing happens during the first 50%. Then, there is mild drama, followed by more nothingness. And, it ends on a somber note.\n", "Thank you to Riverhead Books / Penguin Publishing Group for providing an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.It's 1940 and nineteen year old Vivian Morris is a Vassar College dropout. In the summer of that year, Vivian's parents sent her packing to New York City to stay with her Aunt Peg. Peg owned a dilapidated theater company called the Lily Playhouse which churned out revues sporting former burlesque dancers transformed into showgirls, with mostly forgettable storylines. The ticket prices were cheap to adapt to the low income residents in the immediate neighborhood. The living quarters were located above the theater, its apartments often filled with down on their luck actors, actresses and dancers. Vivian was suddenly thrust into a sparkling world of dazzling, artistic people and life-changing experiences. Some themes explored are loss of virginity, sexual hunger and prowess, and same-sex relationships at a time when it was \"under the radar.\" Vivian was given an exquisite and spacious apartment in the building, which was actually meant for Aunt Peg's flighty actor/writer husband Billy Buell. Although they never officially divorced, Billy was living the Hollywood/playboy life clear across the country. But, that was okay. Aunt Peg had her stalwart mate Olive that oversaw everything at the theater like an army sergeant. This book lured me in from the first page with its beautiful narration by Vivian. Vivian is telling her life story to an unknown person named Angela, whom we don't get to identify until almost the end of the book. Vivian's story is told from 1940 to the present day, in epic fashion. An especially poignant and relevant time period discussed in the book is America's involvement in World War II. I was often deeply moved throughout this tome, and had a fixed vision in my head of the beautiful Vivian. The writing style was easy, flowing, and the pages turned effortlessly. I highly recommend this wonderful book for a rich, quality read.", "Ninety five year old Vivian is telling her life story. She says she is good at two things in life and that's sex and sewing but another thing she excels at is focusing on Vivian. In the first twenty years of her life, the fact that there were other people out there, people who didn't have servants following them around, catering to their every need, never occurred to Vivian. She didn't even know she was rich, she thought everyone was as well off as her, all their monetary and other needs taken care of without a thought to how it happened. Then Vivian flunks out of her first year of Vassar because going to class didn't interest her and she is shipped off to live with her Aunt Peg, in New York City. Peg owns a falling down theater and offers plays to the poor, two plays a day, everyday, and Vivian uses her sewing skills to make costumes for the plays. Vivian also spends all her spare time with the showgirls and every night partying and having sex with men. One of her few regrets in life, at ninety five years of age, is that she didn't have even more sex with men than she had. It's 1940 and the fact that there is a war going on and that the US in getting involved in the war totally flies over Vivian's head...she's busy partying and sexing and nothing would have stopped this thoughtless way of life except she becomes part of a sex scandal that brings her NYC life to a halt. Vivian runs home in shame (although her parents think she came home because she was homesick) and spends the next year moping. Aunt Peg rescues her to have her help put on plays for those working to support the war cause in NYC and Vivvie actually begins to notice what is happening around her. That is the first part of the book and it could have made a complete book. The parts I liked the most were the historical aspects of theater life in NYC and the part of living in NYC during WWII. We then enter the rest of Vivian's life, where she uses her sewing skills to run a bridal boutique, all the while spending many of her evenings having sex with men. See Vivian is ahead of her time, she is the sixties sexual revolution before it ever happened and she's going to tell us about how she and her friends have always been ahead of their times. But also, Vivian is going to use one instance in her life when she was being driven home, in shame after the scandal, where a young man insulted her concerning the scandal, to detail her entire life to a relative of his, seventy five years later. She claims she is telling her life story so that this lonely, hurt man can be known for the wonderful man he really was but I see it as a way to continue keeping the focus on Vivian...it's always Vivian...Vivian is good at sex, sewing, and focusing on Vivian. This is a long book and I kept waiting for Vivian to get to the point but she is the point. This book is about her, with part of the book focusing on the theater world and WWII, also. I could have used a lot less about Vivian but since she is narrating the story and she's the star of her world, that was not going to happen. I enjoyed much of the book and wish I could have liked Vivian better but I must say that this story is true to the personality of Vivian and maybe shouldn't have been written any other way. Thank you to Riverhead Books/Penguin Publishing Group and Edelweiss for this ARC. ", "\nelizabeth gilbert has definitely read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and it showsrtc maybe\n", "Vivian Morris is an elderly woman recounting the days of her youth in this frolic through 1940's New York. She's a nineteen-year-old virgin when she journeys to the city to live in her Aunt Peg's crumbling theater, the Lily Playhouse. Hers is a tale of late-night carousing and rambunctious sexual exploration, followed by war, maturation, and the mundane trivialities of becoming an adult. In the preview to this Advanced Uncorrected Proof, Gilbert writes that she wants this book to \"go down like a champagne cocktail - light and bright, crisp and fun.\" And it nearly does, thanks to occasional bursts of humor, its lively cast of characters, and the glitz and glam of theater life. The narrative starts slow but really picks up once the characters band together to put on a boisterous play they hope will bring some desperately needed funds to the Lily. And the story of Vivian's awkward first sexual experience is the height of hilarity. Vivian's youthful exploits include free love, beautiful showgirls and handsome men, but the book hardly delivers on its promotional promise of being an erotic, rollicking adventure. It's more sensual than erotic, and the narrative is quite somber and melancholy. Most perplexing is the decision to tell the story through the eyes of an aged Vivian. She periodically interrupts to explain the significance of certain moments in her youth, bringing the narrative to a halt. She conveys everything through a hazy film, robbing the narrative of immediacy and putting everything at a remove. With this kind of narrator, there needs to be an arc or epiphany - not in her youth, but in her elder years - some moment that makes it worthwhile to convey the story with hindsight, but Vivian's final revalations are unsurprising. Approach City of Girls with tempered expectations. Instead of the lyricism and gravity of The Signature of All Things or the velvet glamour of graphic dalliances and erotic encounters, anticipate a peach-hued coming-of-age with hints of memoir, a nostalgic and sentimental ode to redefining family and discovering oneself. If I'd been more wise and attentive, I might have realized that America was eventually going to get pulled into this conflagration. [. . .] And I might have realized that some of the fun young men with whom I was cavorting every night in New York City were just the right age to be put on the front lines when America inevitably did enter this war. If I'd known then what I know now - namely: that so many of those beautiful young boys would soon be lost to the battlefields of Europe or to the infernos of the South Pacific - I would have had sex with even more of them. If it sounds like I'm being facetious, I'm not. I wish I'd done more of everything with those boys.*-*Note: Quote taken from an Advanced Uncorrected Proof. Many thanks to the kind people at Penguin Random House for providing a free ARC in exchange for an honest review.", "Well! This was a rip roaring, light, keen read! I'm so glad I didn't miss it!Vivian Morris recounts her days living in New York City during her coming of age years. To say too much about the story would only spoil it, and I certainly don't want to do that. This book has been criticized as having \"too much sex\" in it, and even being \" vulgar.\" Pahleease! It's a fun ride during the early 1940's, and it's honest but not lewd in any way. I loved the voice of the elderly Vivian as she recounts her voyage as she journeys from innocence to experience as pertaining to sex and love. The characters were portrayed with vibrance and umph, really beautifully written. If you're looking for a fun summer read that is upbeat and full of shebang, look no further. This is it!", "DNF @ 230 pages I am really sad that I didn't end up loving this one. I really thought I would love it because of all the comparisons to Evelyn Hugo and the New York setting, but this book was honestly boring me to death. Historical fiction is always a hit or miss for me, and this one was unfortunately a miss. I DNF'ed it after a little more than halfway through because I realized I just don't care, and the main character was annoying the shit out of me. This is a story about a young girl who moves to New York in 1940 and joins the theater scene. I think this book didn't work for me because: I realized I'm not a huge fan of reading about theater. I love reading about films and movies but for some reason theater is different and it really bores me? Also this main character is so flat and one dimensional and so uninteresting and I don't want to read about her hundreds of sex encounters over and over again. All of her friends are very self-absorbed and I didn't find a single character interesting. I just really thought I would love this story and I'm so bummed that I didn't. The only reason this is getting compared to Evelyn Hugo at all is because of the fact that it's an elderly woman recalling the story of her fascinating youth, but Evelyn Hugo is a thousand times more interesting and her character felt so genuine and real.", "3 stars--It's okay, but I had some issues with it. The basic premise is that Vivian, the 89-year-old narrator, is telling her life story to someone named Angela in the form of a letter. I did love the level of historical detail included in this (mostly) WWII-era novel. Although \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" took place a bit later, I vividly pictured the characters running around a New York that looked something like it did in that TV show.I appreciated Vivian's sense of humor--you know she doesn't take herself too seriously when she claims, \"The only two things I've ever been good at in this world are sex and sewing.\" No, I wasn't holding my sides or belly laughing, but I did chuckle a lot.Through the bulk of the novel, Vivian didn't grow or change much, but I think that's what Gilbert intended. For the most part, we're supposed to take Vivian at face value. For this reason, the big leaps forward in time bothered me a bit. It's hard to tell how or why Vivian develops when big chunks of time are left out of her story.The other really big thing that kept me from enjoying City of Girls as much as I could have is that the text itself was prepared sloppily. I was *not* reading an ARC or galley, so the English should have been nearly perfect. In my version, there were lots of stray commas that really broke up the flow of sentences. No one's perfect, but this problem was so prevalent that it had a negative impact on the reading experience.In addition, the text was mostly written in American English, but there were UK spellings thrown in at random. Gilbert is American, and her narrator is American. I got a US edition from my US public library, so there's no logical explanation for the weird inconsistency in the text. Maybe Penguin was trying to cut corners in the editing department?City of Girls gets a down-the-middle 3 from me because there are worse ways to spend a few hours. It's an okay beach read that won't make anyone think too hard.", "This book was a mishmash of 2 different stories thrown together. Three quarters of the book was Vivian experiencing New York in her late teens and early twenties pre and during WW2. The rest of the book jumped ahead 15 to 20 years where someone she had only met once re-enters her life. Then the tone and story of the book totally changed and doesn\u2019t match the writing style in the first part of the book. The final chapter then jumps about 25 years to try to pull it all together. The character of Vivian was a dumb woman who didn\u2019t seem to think for herself. For her privileged up-bringing that is touted heavily, Vivian never once questions morality of what she\u2019s doing. I expect characters in Historical Fiction to be far more interesting. I would have preferred the story of Edna or Peg over Vivian. Oftentimes it felt like it was a bore to read the book but I was given an advanced copy and knew I needed to finish it to write a review. Parts of the book were over done and I hope the final version is edited to be more concise.", "4 \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\u200d\ud83e\uddb1 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83e\uddb3 \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffbS E X Early reviews I read noted there was a lot of it in these pages. It\u2019s right up there with politics and religion at the dinner table in polite conversation. There are girls and women still schooled in the \u2018you\u2019re not supposed to initiate, enjoy, or have too much of it\u2019 belief.Elizabeth Gilbert is not one of them so she writes about it and other topics like satisfaction vs happiness, friendships that stand the test of time and circumstance, living and thinking outside the box, different paths chosen, and the discovery that true family doesn\u2019t always share the same bloodline.Initially an entertaining and lighthearted story about people working the tawdry side of live theater during 1940s New York, it centers on good girl turned wild girl Vivian Morris and takes a more thoughtful turn halfway through when she learns the very hardest way \u201csome mistakes can never be put right\u2014not by the passage of time, and not by our most fervent wishes either.\u201dThe 466 pages flew by.

By the end I settled on 2 stars. The story is not fluid, nor does it make much sense. In 1940's New York City theater district, the play 'City of Girls' is gaining momentum. 'City of Girls' is an off-Broadway play written and executed by a Hollywood writer once married to the Lily Playhouse's owner, Aunt Peg. Aunt Peg is a New Yorker through and through. Her 19-year-old niece Vivian, the protagonist, is living with her after failing out of Vassar College and disappointing her well-to-do parents. Fast forward to present day and you meet Vivian at the age of 80. Vivian receives a very brief letter from a woman named Angela, simply asking Vivian about the nature of the relationship between Vivian and Angela's father. This simple question asked on page 2, turns into a nearly 500 page open-letter to Angela, disclosing everything Vivian did between 1940 to present (basically dismissing Angela's question and revealing every single orgasm she has ever had.) Why? I have no clue! It is revealed in the last 2 or 3 chapters who Angela's father actually was to Vivian and- get this- it has nothing to do with 'City of Girls' whatsoever.I was pleased to read about the strong women depicted in this novel. Unfortunately, the authors eagerness to accuratley celebrate feminism missed the mark. The novel is named 'City of Girls', The failing Lily Playhouse Theatres hit which resurrects the company. That was written and developed by a man... A man that is intentionally called to save the day. Huh?The first 2/3 of this novel offer a rich, descriptive look into pre- WWII New York City's theater district. I was captivated and intrigued, eagerly awaiting the finale. I was curiously predicting who Angela's mother and father could possibly be as I learned more and more about the Lily Playhouse showgirls and young love interests of Vivian's youth. They were elaborately recounted with care. So when I found out who Angela's father was, and that he had nothing to do with the letters objective, and he was weakly introduced and developed, I could not help but be sorely disappointed. Not only that, but the most developed characters we meet early on pretty much fall of the planet. Their departure was weak.Elizabeth Gilbert gave us the most narcissistic character I've ever read. This attempt to write a progressive piece fell completely short. Many hot-button issues were narrated, but with such a desperation that it felt unnatural. For example: Vivian loses her virginity after being set up by her showgirl friends to meet a married man who had a fetish for showgirls. He meets with one every Saturday and then pays them. Gilbert insists to the reader that it was not in fact prostitution because there's a \"mutual agreement\". After losing her virginity, Vivian walks away, laughing all the way back to the diner where her friends are eagerly awaiting to hear about her first sexual encounter. Give me a break. No privileged 19-year-old girl is going to suddenly abandon her virginity and act as if it were just another day in the life. Later, Vivian goes into great detail discussing her sexual relationship with her first love, including but not excluding in great detail, her first time receiving oral sex. Later we get to hear about her first time masturbating, oh! And the random three-way she has with her best friend and a married man. These are the issues with the book; it's not the content so much as the way Gilbert executes the storyline. None of this has anything to do with Angela's question- The question that sets the book up for the story you're about to read. So I have to beg the question: if somebody wrote you a letter asking how you knew their father, would you tell them about how you moved to New York City a naive virgin, lost your virginity to a married man who paid you for the sex, had a three-way with your best friend and the husband of the woman you admire most at the theater, repeatedly discuss the intimate details of your sex life, divulge your scandals, go in to lengthy detail about your family and friends who never even met your father, spend hundreds of pages talking about a play your aunt and her ex-husband made, talk about your small-business ventures, only to close the letter with a couple of pages talking about how you did indeed meet their father?If I were Angela I would have replied:Dear Vivian,Sorry I asked.Don't call me, I'll call you.Angela. If this review is confusing you and all over the place then you already have a great idea of what it was like to read this book.", "\nThis story hooked me from the opening line. I thought this was SO MUCH FUN, and adored the narrative voice, which is quite different from Gilbert's previous works.\n", "This definitely feels like a book of two halves: the first is a glorious rush of youthful hedonism, and is just so *joyous*. The characters leap off the page and the boho background of a slightly ramshackle neighbourhood theatre is rendered with loving detail from the stunning showgirls to the quiet songwriter, the English star who can't return to London during the Blitz to the Hollywood writer who creates the surprising mega-hit musical ' City of Girls'. The writing flows, Vivie is an adorable ingenue who soon loses all her inhibitions, drinking, carousing and sleeping her way around 1940 Manhattan.Then something happens that stops her life in its tracks and as Pearl Harbour happens in the background, Vivie's life takes a soberer turn, a putting away of youth. This half of the book felt a bit more 'told' to me as we're very conscious of Vivie speaking to a correspondent. It's still interesting, especially in its depiction of an independent woman who doesn't conform to gendered expectations, but doesn't have the same life and joie de vivre of the first half - age is inevitable, and we feel it in the tone of the story. To compensate, there is a lovely, unusual love story though it's quite late before it appears.Gilbert's writing flows so easily that I picked up this book to just dip in... and found myself having read a third without even noticing! With a definite feminist slant, wisdom and an easy style with words, this slides down so easily. The first half is outstanding, the second quieter - a lovely book that I enjoyed immensely.Many thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC via NetGalley.", "\nI INHALED this book! It's an absolutely gorgeous novel about a woman figuring her life out before, during, and after WW2. It manages to be a fun, fast read, while also grappling with big messy issues like shame, grief, and how we live with our choices and mistakes. Read it!\n", "Oh, to think that had it not been for the library e-audiobook, I wouldn't have read this delightful novel. The fact that it was yet another \"girl\" book and that the reviews were quite mixed made me think I shouldn't bother.Well, I'm so happy I gave it a go. Again, a million thanks to my wonderful library.City of Girls is a masterclass in voice. It was like nothing I've read before. Blair Brown's delivery was stupendous, I can't emphasise that enough. This was an original novel, about Vivian Morris's life, whom we meet as an unassuming, bored nineteen-year-old. She flourishes once she moves to New York to live with her unconventional, theatre owner aunt. In no time at all, Vivian turns into a fun-loving, sexually adventurous young woman, taking all sort of risks, especially for a young woman in the 1940s. I can't remember the last time or if ever I read about the multiple sexual dalliances of a woman of that era. Of course, I arched my moralistic and practical eyebrow about her nightly drunken escapades since Vivian wasn't getting much sexual satisfaction - in a conventional way. But Vivian thought it fun, so that's what matters, until she got into trouble.I enjoyed reading about Vivian's time at the Lily Playhouse, surrounded by showgirls and other show people.Above all, I appreciated this novel's tone, Vivian's irreverence and her way of looking at the world. This was a fun romp, incredibly well executed, brilliantly written.I loved everything about it.", "I wanted to like this book soooooooooooooooooooo badly! While I've never read Eat, Pray, Love or any of Elizabeth Gilbert's previous works, but \nCity of Girls\n was getting so much buzz that I just HAD to read it. While the writing was great\u2014Elizabeth Gilbert really knows how to craft a story\u2014I just couldn't connect with the narrative. Sadly, I was bored for a majority of the story and I couldn't wait for it to end. If \nCity of Girls\n could've been condensed into 300 pages of the same plot, I think the pacing would've helped me enjoy it more. I don't want to spoil the reader as to why I had issues with this story, because if I say any rationale behind it, it surely would spoil it for you. Don't take my word for it, look at all these magnificent reviews for \nCity of Girls\n! Not every book can be a five star read, but it's good that we have this forum to agree, disagree, and communicate! ", "\n\"Never has it felt more important for me to tell stories of joy and abandon, passion and recklessness. Life is short and difficult, people. We must take our pleasures where we can find them. Let us not become so cautious that we forget to live.\u201d\nCaptivating, dazzling, and memorable. I loved this book!The novel revolves around Vivian Morris as she narrates the story of her life. We follow her as she moves to New York City to live with her bold Aunt Peg, who owns and runs a theater. The story is about friendship, mistakes, growing up, second chances, and so much more.Some characters were a hoot, would love to spend some time with them. Eccentric, interesting, adventurous. Great story, great characters, highly recommend it!", "\u201cLife is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.\u201dCity of girls is a lifestory of Vivian Morris, a woman in her nineties, told in a letter to a younger woman Angela, whose connection to Vivian we do not discover until almost the end of the book. Vivian came from a well-off family. I really enjoyed the description of Vivian\u2019s year at Vassar where she managed to fail every single class mainly due to a total lack of interest. Vivian was then sent to New York City to live with her Aunt Peg, an owner of theatre. In her own words, Vivian was good at two things in her life: sewing and sex. The first skill she puts to work designing and making costumes for the plays in Aunt Peg\u2019s theatre. The second, well, there was plenty of that too, as 19 year-old Vivian throws herself into a life full of parties with other showgirls and all sorts of men. In her preface Elizabeth Gilbert said that she wanted \u201cto write a novel about promiscuous girls whose lives are not destroyed by their sexual desires.\u201d Looking back at those years (the first part of the book is set in early 1940s with the WWII going on), Vivian reflects: \u2018I might have realized that some of the fun young men with whom I was cavorting every night in New York City were just the right age to be put on the front lines when America inevitably did enter this war. If I'd known then what I know now - namely: that so many of those beautiful young boys would soon be lost to the battlefields of Europe or to the infernos of the South Pacific - I would have had sex with even more of them\u2019. I cannot deny that Vivian is not always a likeable character, she is way too self-absorbed for that, but there is a special energy and vitality about her that makes you want to continue reading this book in order to find out how this coming-of-age story is going to turn out. The later parts are not as colourful and full of joie de vivre, which is only natural, as they deal with a more mature Vivian. An engaging book set in an interesting period of time and full of well-developed colourful characters. Thank you to Edelweiss and Riverhead Books (Penguin Publishing Group) for the ARC provided in exchange for an honest opinion.", "\nJust finished this book in a marathon reading session on the beach. It was vibrant and deep and complicated and lovely. Time well spent and something any Liz Gilbert fan will enjoy. For that matter, something that those who are not her fans will enjoy as well if they are people who love New York City, love life or simply love a well-crafted tale.\n", "Besides Good Talk, City of Girls may have been my most-anticipated 2019 release. Elizabeth Gilbert's abundant fiction skills employed in service of a fluffy tale of a Vassar dropout finding her way in the big city? Sounds like a perfect summer read! And it was! This tale of well-brought-up Vivian Morris finding herself amid a ragtag theatre crowd in 1940s Manhattan was fun and funny and just scandalous enough to keep me reading. Given that this novel takes place on the cusp of U.S. involvement in WWII, the real world does eventually make a sobering appearance, to mixed effect: On the one hand, it was surely a lot less fun to think about, but on the other hand it grounded the book in something more meaningful, and that was undeniably for the best. But in the end, what most struck me about City of Girls was the way Gilbert validated all types of relationships\u2014not just the lifelong hetero marriages all women of Vivian's time were expected to want, but close friendships, brief flings, mentorships, and other companionships not so easily defined. The ultimate message of this novel is that we don't all want the same things, or get the same things, and there's nothing wrong with that. This message, wrapped up in the pretty ribbon of the plotline, makes City of Girls pretty much irresistible.As a final note, going in I'd heard a lot about how much sex City of Girls supposedly had, leading me to initially be disappointed in how much sex the book actually had, which was, frankly, not a lot. Sure, sex is talked about some, and there are two actual sex scenes (in a nearly 500-page book!), but none of it is graphic. So if you were worried about that, don't let it scare you off. And if, like me, you were expecting more, no worries: This novel's pleasures are many, no matter how you look at it.", "Vassar dropout Vivian Morris is sent to live with Aunt Peg, owner of a rundown theatre in New York featuring showgirls in 1940 by her frustrated parents.

Vivian is a complicated woman who lived an unconventional life. She felt she was only really good at two things\u2014sex and sewing.The closest thing to a traditional plot is the development of the theatre production, City of Girls, in the first half of the book. This section is fun and fascinating. Vivian finds her calling in creating costumes for the production and the showgirls introduce Vivian to clubbing and sex. The second half of the book starts with a huge scandal that Vivian is smack dab in the middle of. She is driven home by her brother whom has recently joined the Navy. Enter WWII and the City of New York and Vivian\u2019s own life are forever changed.Gilbert does an excellent job in transporting the reader to 1940s New York\u2014particularly the theatre district. The narcissism of Vivian and her appetite for meaningless sex is off-putting, but Gilbert has fun with the narrative regardless. Enjoy!", "\nI like this novel! My expectations were fairly low after reading several mixed reviews. But I was happily surprised. I enjoyed reading the entire 470 pages. The first chunk was entertaining and fun to digest - but without much substance. It flowed well and I didn't notice the length that other reviewers critiqued.

I'd like to hand him this book and say, \"Bite me, asshat. This is satire.\"I suppose that's an entirely different story. The point is, I loved this book. It's sharp, witty, heartwarming, and entirely entertaining. Of course, it came from someone involved with Arrested Development\u2014should I expect any less?The first three-fourths of this book are told in the form of email correspondence, magazine articles, even doctors' bills purportedly strung together by fifteen-year-old Bee in an attempt to tell her mother Bernadette's story. Bernadette is the quintessential misunderstood genius. In her thirties, she became one of the few female architects to stand out from the crowd and was eventually awarded a MacArthur genius grant. When project particularly near-and-dear to her heart was destroyed, Bernadette's psyche began to fray. Then her husband, Elgie took a job at Microsoft and the family moved to Seattle. Now, they live in an abandoned home for girls and their daughter has overcome a congenital heart condition to succeed brilliantly at a charter school, whose wannabe-upper-crust parents resent Bernadette's refusal to take part in the community. Bernadette, for her part, is still struggling to get over the heartbreak of her previous life and has developed an agoraphobia so severe that she has hired a virtual personal assistant to take care of her daily errands remotely from India. As the book begins, Bee is cashing in on the promise her parents made that, if she achieves straight A's, she can have any gift she likes. She wants a family trip to Antarctica, a request that sends Bernadette's anxiety skyrocketing. Meanwhile, their catty neighbor Audrey is declaring war on Bernadette and her blackberry bushes. Picture the biggest busybody from a Desperate Housewives-style show, the kind of woman who erroneously believes that her obnoxious behavior is beneficial to and appreciated by everyone else. She wants to host a bruncheon [I don't know if that's a word, but I'm coining it now] to woo legitimately upper-crust parents to the charter school and Bernadette's blackberry bushes are interfering. To say that Audrey has it out for Bernadette is an understatement, but when the bruncheon ends in catastrophe, it's the proverbial straw that breaks Bernadette. Elgie, concerned that his wife's anxiety and paranoia have become larger than life, attempts to stage an intervention for Bernadette. Unfortunately, he instead discovers that Bernadette has disappeared and it's up to Bee to find her.This book gently pokes fun at tech culture and at people who desperately want to be in the next highest social strata, but where Semple really excels is in her unfolding of Bernadette. There are certainly aspects of the plot that require some suspension of disbelief, but Bernadette is such a great character. She tried keeping it together but at some point, she snapped and completely folded into herself in anxiety and desperation. She hates Seattle, the parents at Bee's school, her husband's company, everything around her...except her daughter. She loves Bee desperately and wants to do anything she can for her daughter. At the same time, she's an artist whose stunted mental health has fried her ability and opportunity to create, which has only made her more anxious and more depressed. What else can I say? This book isn't high-minded literature, but it's not really trying to be. It's a send-up of a wacky, soapish storyline that manages to stay completely engrossing\u2014I couldn't put it down. And it's touching! It's ultimately about self-acceptance\u2014finding what makes you happy and learning how to balance that with the expectations of others that you can't shake off. And there's this quote, which I loved: \"This is why you must love life: one day you're offering up your social security number to the Russian Mafia; two weeks later you're using the word calve as a verb.\"I dare say that if you can't appreciate it, then maybe you just don't get satire (I kid, I kid.)", "\n\nLooking for a new book but don't want to commit?

I was laughing to myself almost every chapter - Semple combined just the right amount of hilarity and heartwarming hi-jinks.Bernadette has such an amazing take on life - she was sassy and witty every single moment she was on the page. \n'That's right,' she told the girls. 'You are bored. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it's boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it's on you to make life interesting, the better off you'll be.'\n My favorite part? The ongoing battle with Audrey - the snooty next door neighbor. The petty squabbling and the exponentially increasing responses made my jaw drop - especially when the kindergartners got PTSD from billboard incident.

(This happens a lot...)I'm hesitant to assign a star rating here (more hesitant than usual) Not only did I read this months ago, but the genre isn't one that I spend a lot of time reading.But where *do* I rank it? I know it didn't anger or disappoint me in any way (I'd remember that) but neither did I feel the need to rush on here and review it, or force it on any of my friends. (I know a book is genuinely good if I feel the need to share it.) I did enjoy it, and that's saying something, given that it's outside my regular reading habits and I don't think I'm the target audience for the book. It's solidly written, clever and witty in turns, slightly absurdist in its humor, and comes to good resolution.So.... four stars? Sure. Whatever. Let's call it four. Whatever that means.If you're the sort of person who only reads fantasy (as I know some of my readers are) be aware this doesn't have any of that in there. Also, female main character here. So if you're one of those dudes who is terrified of catching cooties from a book, look out. There's feelings and shit in this book, and a girl looking for her mother. Personally, I liked it. If the thought of that makes your nuts retreat protectively up into your body, you might want to think of this as less than four stars. (And possibly consider getting some therapy to work out your unresolved issues.) If you're someone who enjoys more personal narratives. YA stuff. Or what's typically considered \"Chick Lit\" (Though I hate that term.) odds are you'll like this more than four stars worth. Parenthetically yours, pat", "What we have here is a satirical epistolary novel about a bunch of whiny one percenters in Seattle. Ms. Semple is sending up Seattle elites, which here seem to be typified by Bernadette's husband Elgie, a granola eating, public transport using, bike riding, Microsoft employee with a genius IQ. She also sets her sights on the students and parents of a Montessori-style preparatory school. I don't feel a particular need to explain what happens, because it's pretty well-traveled stuff. Where BERNADETTE sets itself apart is the storytelling style. The story here takes the form of a packet of documents that Bernadette's daughter has prepared after Bernadette disappears. These include emails between Elgie's assistant and a disgruntled neighbor, emails between Bernadette and her Indian assistant Manjula, police reports, magazine articles, etc. These documents have a kind of zingy, lighthearted, ironic quality about them, and it makes for an energetic and enjoyable story. Narration between the documents is provided in brief snippets by Bernadette's precocious daughter Bee. Alas, there are many problems, and the book never lives up to its promise. Semple is trying to have it both ways. Bernadette, for example is a ruthlessly satirized Type A East Coast transplant. We're supposed to find her ridiculous, but we're also expected to fall for her. Semple wants us to believe she's a genius because she won a MacArthur genius grant, even though there's very little else in the way of supporting evidence. She wants us to find Bernadette mysterious and admirable. But I was never really drawn in by Bernadette's positive qualities, or able to find them at all. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if it wasn't so clear that I was supposed to like her. Also, the title and jacket copy of this book seem to promise that it's about the mysterious disappearance of, and search for, Bernadette. The problem is that Bernadette never really disappears. She leaves briefly, but her reasons for leaving are pretty clear, and it's not hard to guess where she went--the setting of Antarctica, promised by the icy mountains on the cover and tons and tons of buildup throughout, might provide a clue. But the book suffers the most when the narration switches to Bee full time after the disappearance. This switch is somewhat painstakingly explained, but it felt lazy to me. There had to be a way to keep the form that had been so successful for the first two thirds of the book for the final act. It felt like Semple was trying to write a book that was zany, unique, and inventive, but also perfectly conventional, with all the benefits of both storytelling styles. In my mind, this book depended on the inventiveness of its epistolary style, and abandoning it was disaster. All in all, worth reading. This is the kind of book that very well could have left me shaking my head and wondering how the author pulled it off, if only she had pulled it off. Ah, well. I received this in ARC form from the Nervous Breakdown book club, and I hope they dress it up a bit for the hardcover. I think it would be better if the documents appeared in different forms and fonts, if Elgie's handwritten letter appeared handwritten, etc. I can't close this review without saying that this book's cover is unfortunate. While I did have issues here, this book represents a serious effort, and it deserved a serious cover. It will be interesting to see what Maria Semple does next.", "\nPRO: Made me think about all the time I've spent in SeattleCON: Made me think about all the time I've spent in Seattle\n", "For the first time ever, I'm going with the Goodreads-appointed rating system. This book was simply \"OK\", therefore I am giving it 2 stars. I didn't hate it or anything, but it really didn't do anything for me.I didn't find it funny (or all that quirky to be quite honest), and the characters were all a bit bland. I was also disappointed that what I had originally thought was the whole point of the book (Bernadette disappearing right before a trip to Antarctica) didn't even happen until way later in the story. I found the lead-up to Bernadette's disappearance to be quite dull, and I only became vaguely interested when it finally happened.I don't have very strong emotions towards this book, which leads me to believe it just wasn't for me.", "3/5 \u2b50Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf \ud83d\udc3a(Quick funny story: after I read how Bernadette had disappeared, my immediate Romanian reaction was: \nA disp\u0103rut ca m\u0103garul \u00een cea\u021b\u0103!\n which literally means \u201dShe disappeared like the donkey in the fog\u201d. Yeah *dubious Romanian piece of wisdom ahem*).Now. This is not exactly my type of book, I am not ashamed to admit that I found it boring in some places more than in others and I will not apologise for saying that the writing style was kind of annoying me. \nBut it wasn\u2019t a horrible book, people!\nAs short as it might seem (a little over 300 pages), it took me a load of days to finish it. The idea of the novel is a clever one, but the writing style it was framed in was a bit off because it drew the attention from the actual serious themes that were being put in the scene. Drug addiction, mental health issues, depression and anxiety mostly, family issues, feminism and so many others were exposed in this novel, but they weren\u2019t quite as obvious as they should\u2019ve been, because switching between the emails and letters and the other types of correspondence is, indeed, an innovation of style, but it is also I bit attention-tiring. Even though I might sound like I disliked this book so much (\u2026and now, why did you read it if you don\u2019t have nice things to say about it anyway??), I actually didn\u2019t dislike it. And I am telling you why I kept reading it until the end: Bernadette.I had some parts in the book where I was 90% sure that Bernadette is me as a mum (the other 10% stand for the fact that Bernadette is me irl in my good days lol). Like I could really relate to her. Her personality is so interestingly beautiful that I could not stop thinking about how cool she is and I would actually love to be mistaken and find out that a real-life Bernadette Fox exists out there for me to meet with her. Also, another lovable character was Bee Branch, the daughter of Bernadette, who is a perfect-grade child, who actually enjoys school and is into some kind of weird holiday preferences, like going to an Antarctica trip for Christmas. Kind of unexpected. But she\u2019s actually my type of child, because, you know what, I might be into some weird-arse holiday preferences myself, you know, me and my inner child. I wonder how would my parents react if I would\u2019ve had perfect grades through all of my school years just to make them take me to my dream-holiday, an African safari? (Probably unimpressed, but meh). The mother-daughter relationship between the two of them is just so nice and comfy. I love the fact that they are warm with each other, understand each other and protect each other. It is a wonderful feeling and I, personally, find it even more wonderful because it kind of reminds me of my relationship with my mummy, whom, I must say, I absolutely adore (\u2764\ufe0f). In rest, all those characters look somehow fake and a tad improbable. Like Elgin, for instance. Why is Elgin Branch so obsessed with the idea that his wife is a loony who must be, by all means, locked away in a loony bin? She is a genius, mate, geniuses are legitimate loonies, you don\u2019t question that, you don\u2019t fix that, you just have to deal with it. Another unreal character is Soo-Lin and, attached to that, her twisted relationship with her boss, Elgin Branch (yes, mate, you are everywhere!). I totally understand that she is a divorcee with two children, but the idea of admiring your boss and his geniality so much that you fall in love with him and start manipulating him in some way is a bit too much for me. She\u2019s actually not in love with him, but only with the idea of him, of what he does at that big company and the idea of the power that he has.Until the end, things just seem to be as messy as they became after Bernadette disappeared, but then things start to get explained. The fakest gnat of them all, Audrey Griffin, turns out to be actually the key of both Bernadette\u2019s escape and also her return. Indeed, people can change and throughout this book, Audrey did change. More than any other character. In my eyes, she actually gained some depth, some feeling, some empathy. And this makes me happy. 3D-personality people are enjoyable people, who please my integrity thoughts.All in all, not to worry about, everything locks solidly in a happy ending, hurray for happy endings! Somehow, the ending made me have another glimpse over the whole book, making me re-think some thoughts that I had at the beginning. AND NOW, let\u2019s see what response would the film to the book!", "Well, let this be a lesson to those who would open their mouths and spew venom into the world. I once wrote very publicly and loudly on this here Goodreads that I could never love a satire -- don't even remember which book I was reviewing*. The point is, this book has made me eat my words. This fucking book, man. I loved it. It's my cheese, my oreo cookie, my soft blanket on a cold winter's night, my let's pack everything up and head out for an adventure because FUCK YEAH WE'RE ALIVE. I'm so glad I randomly picked this book up at my library. Like, last second, I was checking out and there it was, and I just grabbed it. Best last minute decision ever.*Found it! And oh, of course it was a Waugh.Where'd You Go, Bernadette is a modern day epistolary novel, but not like one of those ones you read as a teenager with like whiny emails and diary entries from lovelorn pimple-faces, it's like layers and layers of subtle genius. Bee is fifteen and loves her mother, her eccentric and troubled mother, who one day disappears. The book is a meta-compilation supposedly put together by Bee of emails, articles, and other assorted correspondences that tell the story of Bernadette: what made her who she is, and what led up to her disappearance. The first 75% of the book is just a delightful satire, on the wealthy and privileged, on the self-deluded and spiritually empty -- but what really makes it are the bits of real emotion that are constantly peeking through. This story genuinely made me feel things, and like I mean that it in all caps, FEEL THINGS. Plus, it's just wacky. Maria Semple used to work on Arrested Development, if that gives you some idea of what I mean by 'wacky.'Now, just to warn you, I'm writing this all high off the ending (which was just fucking lovely), so I might be a bit biased, and you might end up reading it and being like, Ashley, what the fuck? Just keep that in mind. But to put it in frame of reference, I liked this book almost as much as I liked Ready Player One (and I fucking love Ready Player One), but it's a different kind of love. I don't want to say anymore because I just want you to go read the book. I mean it. GO!", "Simply put: READ THIS, or you WILL have a supremely LAME life.

Bawl-like-a-baby cry... over the disappearance of this unique individual. Finding her is the main objective in this crazy mixed-media project. \"Where'd You Go, Bernadette\" is what astute book worms crave. ABSOLUTE MUST !! !! !! !!READREADREADREADREADREAD!!!!!!!!! I will never stop recommending Bernadette! It is one of the best novels of the 21 st century.", "There is a new genre of contemporary fiction in which believability is thrown out the window in favor of wacky plot machinations, but which is not satire because the emotions of the characters are too real. (See also, \"This Is Where I Leave You.\")When her daughter was born with a heart condition which gave her skin a blueish hue, Bernadette Fox named her daughter, Balakrishna Branch, because the Indian God, Krishna, is blue and the name means \"child Krishna.\" Wacky, huh?!! (In case you were wondering, Bernadette is not Indian, and she isn't even Hindu.) Bernadette calls all of the other mothers at her daughter's school \"gnats\" because they are bothersome to her - always wanting her to particpate in classroom activities. Wacky, huh?!! Bernadette spends her grant money buying a girls' reform school in Seattle to renovate as their home and which is in such disrepair that weeds grow up through the floorboards so she has to hire a gardener to weed-whack the dining room. Wacky, huh?!! Oh, and did I mention that she is a genius - MacArthur grant and all?Bernadette's husband is also wacky!! He doesn't wear shoes when he works!! He asks to be removed from his daughter's school email list because he doesnt have time to read all that nonsense!! He wears headphones so people don't bother him on the Microsoft bus!! Oh, and he is a genius too with the Number 4 most popular TED talk!!! Semple puts these wacky folks into all sorts of wacky situations - a mud slide during the progressive school's prospective kindergarten parents brunch, a police raid at the Westin hotel, a quest to obtain illegal psychotic medication to avoid seasickness, an FBI sting operation, an escape across the Antarctic Sea in Zodiac boats. There is so much wackiness that it becomes exhausting.The problem is that Bernadette's daughter, Bee, is a totally believable character. A fifteen-year-old girl who has overcome her health issues, and loves to learn, and loves her wacky parents despite it all, so as a reader, on Bee's behalf, I became outraged when Semple has these parents behave in ways which injure Bee, again and again, through their self-centeredness, their childishness, and their neglect. I don't understand how Semple wants me, the reader, to react, and that is a problem.Semple writes well - she is clever and has a nice turn of phrase, and I enjoyed parts of this book tremendously, but as a whole, it did not hold together for me at all.As a final insult, this book ends so suddenly, it gave me whiplash. I was listening to it on CD and I pulled the car over to make sure that somehow I had not lost a disk, despite the fact that the narrator was intoning, \"Thank you for listening to....\" I could not believe it. I could not believe that the book was over. I have no idea what happened to these characters or how the plot was resolved. I was shocked.

No, no one'll notice it's not Seattle. It will be in theaters Mother's Day 2018, which is yet another belt in the chops to women everywhere.Rating: 1.6* of five (p97)The Publisher Says: Bernadette Fox is notorious. To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friend and, simply, Mom.Then Bernadette disappears. It began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle--and people in general--has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.To find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, secret correspondence--creating a compulsively readable and touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world. My Review: I do not care where this stupid, whining woman went. I want her to stay there and remain anonymous.Awful. Negative. Condescending to agoraphobics. It's as noxious as Gone Girl, and cloaked in humor instead of viciousness it still makes me mad. Jonathan Franzen liked it, so did Garth Stein and Kate Atkinson.

Bernadette is a quirky,opinionated, likable character. Bernadette disappears one day after her 15 year old daughter aces her report card and wants to claim her promised award: a family trip to Antarctica. The only problem is that Bernadette is agoraphobic and uses her assistant in India to run most of her errands. My best advice: READ THIS BOOK! It's hilarious, funny and a welcome relief to books that seem to be similar to other books. This book is original, well thought out and laugh out loud funny.", "Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple is a book about a family living in Seattle, Washington. Bernadette is wife to Elgin (Elgie), and their Daughter Bee is a young teen just out of middle school.Before moving to Seattle, Bernadette suffered a catastrophic event in her arcitect career that\u2019s totally changed her; she\u2019s become extremely anti social and tends to hide from everyone; she does what she wants, on her own terms, regardless of what anyone thinks; and now others, including Elgin, are suffering because of it.Elgin works for Microsoft and is well-respected. Although his relationship with Bernadette used to be wonderful, since her life-changing event in L.A., their marriage is now strained. He\u2019s heavily involved in work and he\u2019s lost patience for her behavior. Eventually, he comes to terms with the fact that Bernadette\u2019s likely suffering from multiple mental disorders and feels it\u2019s time for an intervention.Their daughter Bee is super smart. Due to a congenital heart condition, Bee\u2019s physically smaller than other teens her age but she\u2019s strong-willed and considers herself normal. She does well in school, gets excellent grades, and maintains a close relationship with her mother Bernadette despite her unorthodox behaviors. There is love and connection between these two even through all the madness. Bee and Bernadette are best friends, because let\u2019s face it: Bernadette makes life fun.\n\u201cI can pinpoint that as the single happiest moment of my life, because I realized then that Mom would always have my back. It made me feel giant. I raced back down the concrete ramp, faster than I ever had before, so fast I should have fallen, but I didn\u2019t fall, because Mom was in the world.\u201d\nBee\u2019s parents make a deal with her that if she receives good grades in middle school (for graduation), she can have whatever she wants afterward. Her grades are in, and she\u2019s calling in her reward of choice: a family trip to Antarctica. This about throws Bernadette into straight panic. She\u2019s already struggling with enough challenges and this may be too much for her. How is she going to deal with this?The majority of this book is epistolary in nature and told in correspondence, whether it be emails, notes, or documents. I was a little unsure of the format at first because it started to feel \u201cbusy\u201d to me, but surprisingly, it turned out to be okay; in fact, I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been better written any other way. There are interludes told from Bee\u2019s point of view as the protagonist which connects everything together nicely. This made the book feel unique to me and I really did like the author\u2019s writing style.I had many different emotions reading through this story. Some parts were laugh-out-loud hilarious, and other times certain characters angered me and seemed absurd. The main characters were easy to connect with, while a few others were quite funny. I was actually able to identify with Bernadette and her introverted behavior more than any others; although, her extremes were more difficult, but once you see what she\u2019s experienced in the past you begin to understand her better. Having a daughter with a similar congenital heart condition was something else that connected me to Bernadette and Bee. Also, anyone who\u2019s suffered from anxiety and depression can probably totally relate to Bernadette.\nGetting into fights with people makes my heart race. Not getting into fights with people makes my heart race. Even sleeping makes my heart race! I\u2019m lying in bed when the thumping arrives, like a foreign invader. It\u2019s a horrible dark mass, like the monolith in 2001, well-organized but completely unknowable, and it enters my body and releases adrenaline. Like a black hole, it sucks in any benign thoughts that might be scrolling across my brain and attaches visceral panic to them. For instance, during the day I might have mused, Hey, I should pack more fresh fruit in Bee\u2019s lunch. That night, with the arrival of The Thumper, it becomes, I\u2019VE GOT TO PACK MORE FRESH FRUIT IN BEE\u2019S LUNCH!!! I can feel the irrationality and anxiety draining my store of energy like a battery-operated racecar grinding away in the corner. This is the energy I will need to get through the next day. But I just lie in bed and watch it burn, and with it any hope for a productive tomorrow. There go the dishes, there goes the grocery store, there goes exercise, there goes bringing in the garbage cans. There goes basic human kindness. I wake up in a sweat so thorough I sleep with a pitcher of water by the bed or I might die of dehydration.\nI asked myself more than once: What is so wrong with Bernadette not wanting to go to Antarctica? Maybe her plan to get out of the trip was crazy, but why should anyone ever be forced to do something they don\u2019t want to; I mean, does that really make them mental? It\u2019s thought-provoking, and this trip to Antarctica had much more importance in the story than I expected. Bernadette is essentially on her own journey and needs to find a way to straighten herself out.Even though this book is obviously meant to be humerous (satire), there was a serious tone to parts of the book for me. I don\u2019t think this is what the author wanted when writing it, but it\u2019s always a challenge for me to find humor when it comes to people struggling with mental health. People develop mental health problems for many different reasons, and everyone deals with it in their own way, but mental disorders have the power to split a family apart and end lives. I feel like the author did a good job portraying the struggles within this family, how mental disorders affect others, and even the social stigma that often goes comes with it. This is just my opinion though.With all that said, I didn\u2019t like the ending at all and expected a different outcome, or maybe just more of an outcome. The ending felt rushed and fairly contrived considering the build all the way up to it. Was there really any resolve? I\u2019m not going to spoil it in my review, but I\u2019d love to chat with others about the ending in particular. If it weren\u2019t for the ending going the way it did, this would\u2019ve been a full five-star review for me.Overall, I enjoyed this book and will read more by this author in the future. I\u2019m yet to see the film, but after connecting with the all the main characters, it seems like the cast couldn\u2019t be better.4****You can also read this review @readrantrockandroll.com", "Ugh, this book. You see that one star rating? It earned the single star by being mildly engrossing. I know I usually use the word \"engrossing\" in a positive way, to convey that a book was compelling and interesting, fascinating and exciting. Here I mean that it was just, somehow, able to hold my attention. Not even interest, really, just attention. Somehow. I don't know how. Well I guess this is how: it was entertaining in a way, and it definitely had a certain readability about it. I'm kind of drawn to reading about other people's drama, and that's basically what this whole thing was--catty people and personal family problems and drama.I didn't like any of the characters. I liked the IDEA of Bernadette, but not really her when she was interacting with anyone or writing things herself--just the idea of her, when other people were talking about her. Bee was supposed to be this awesome girl, like the one exception to every other female in the book, who are without exception \"snobbish,\" \"smell weird,\" manipulative and \"crazy\" and back-bitey and unhinged. But apparently the author didn't notice(?) that Bee is way judgmental too.But that's really only part of the misogyny/sexism written into this book (and written into our culture). Then there's the way this book treats relationships between men & women, the gender essentializing, etc. Also the ableism, the white privilege it's dripping with. It's just a whole mess of yuck.It gets one star for the readability & the drama. It lost all the other stars because I kind of hated its tone (every person in it uses the same voice, by the way), its content, its underlying assumptions, its message, I could go on...but I've wated enough time on it already. It's too bad that this brain candy/beach trash novel turned so icky for me.", "1.5 \"whatever~~\" stars !!.Maria Semple is a very clever, clear and concise writer which are all really good attributes....however this book was beyond disappointing.....it was at the upper end of \"crap\".....two dimensional caricatures behaving so horribly and uncomprehendingly towards each other....each character was more unlikeable than the last not in some interesting and insightful way (the Casual Vacancy comes to mind in its psychological empathic brilliance) but in a way that makes you fear for American culture and the selfishness and narcissism that may be inherent in our upper middle classes.I want to end by saying \"I don't care where the f###ck you went Bernadette and I wished you had stayed there\".", "Wow, okay. This is not the book I expected to read. The blurb makes it seem like it\u2019s a \u2018\u2018laugh-out-loud-worthy\u2019\u2019 mystery novel about a mother who disappears and a daughter who moves mountains to find her mom.Sure, that does happen\u2026 in the last 3/4 of the book. Before that, it\u2019s around 250 pages of random, (sometimes) unnecessary e-mail exchanges, some of them between characters that we don\u2019t even care for\u2014at least, I didn\u2019t\u2014as well as numerous anecdotes and mishaps.They do somehow contribute to Bernadette\u2019s disappearance, but only a few specific ones. Still, it\u2019s a page-turner in the sense that all those literally props\u2014letters, interviews, e-mails\u2014are easy to read and relatively humorous.I didn\u2019t think this was a \u2018\u2018laugh-out-loud\u2019\u2019 type of book, but it does contain a good couple of clever dialogs and original scenes.The characters are not ones I cared too much for. Bernadette, Bee, Elgie and the rest of the cast aren\u2019t presented to us in a way that feels genuine. The way they acted and spoke made them look phony, especially Bernadette. She\u2019s such an easy target for ridicule. I guess because so many things are exaggerated. But, at its core, this book does have meaningful themes. Bee\u2019s love for her mother is admirable. Bernadette\u2019s disappearance is impressive. The relationship between Bee and Bernadette reminded me of the one between Lorelai and Rory from Gilmore Girls.It\u2019s not a realistic book, but an entertaining one for sure.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019", "People don't go to Antarctica, they're called to Antarctica...I can't quite make my mind up about this funny/weird/sad book all in one. The beginning of the book made me laugh at almost every page, mainly because of the weird 'mum' and her 'matchless' statements and behavior; it also struck me this story is actually a bit sad. Then the whole correspondence between the ladies Soo-Lin and Audrey Griffin, out of this world funny at times, priceless! The last say 40 pages of the book however I lost my interest a bit, story seems to be at a dead end for me. Still, say close to four stars for this unparalleled witty, loving and funny story with a teary edge to it. About a special strong-minded and witty girl named Bee, her out of bounds mum and the love for each other. Haven't seen any story like this so it's unique and that deserves a good rating! ps I want to go to Antarctica too!", "I figure my best hope of getting more readers than the Cubs have victories is to mention straight away Maria Semple\u2019s bona fides as a satirist. So here it is: she wrote for Arrested Development. Her talent for skewering plays out well in book form, too, as it turns out. Bernadette, the protagonist, is creative, whip-smart, and now that her daughter, Bee, is past some pretty serious childhood health issues, able to devote herself almost entirely to snarky send-ups. The targets are primarily from Seattle where they live. Beyond the standard subjects of grunge, rain, coffee and Microsoft (where husband, Elgie, is an engineering superstar), there are also the cliquish and bothersome moms from Bee\u2019s school. Complications arise, though, wouldn\u2019t you know. Much of the book is back-story told in epistolary form. There are email exchanges between Bernadette and an online personal assistant, notes from Bee\u2019s school, several catty moms opining about Bee\u2019s parents, and various other documents of a plot-spoiling nature. From these we learn that Bee is the most outstanding student in her 8th grade class, Bernadette was an award-winning architect in earlier days, Elgie gave the 4th most popular TED talk ever, they\u2019re planning a family trip to Antarctica to see penguins, and the gnats (as Bernadette refers to the busybody moms from the school) are out of control. The list of problems is a long one, too: Bernadette has lost her professional mojo, Elgie is married to his job, one of the gnats becomes Elgie\u2019s admin, Bernadette has become over-reliant on her personal assistant, and another gnat has brought trumped up charges against Bernadette. Breaking points were reached. Near perfect storm status was achieved. Bee narrates the story of her mom\u2019s disappearance and the subsequent search. But it\u2019s a disservice to go much deeper into the plot. Instead, I\u2019ll mention the pleasure of the overall tone. For one thing, the social satire was done well. The supporting characters were revealed cleverly, with more than just their stereotypes to define them. It was also nice that we weren\u2019t just told that Bernadette, Elgie and Bee were smart, we got to see the evidence of it as well. Another point in the book\u2019s favor is that it had more than just humor going for it. There were also deeper probes into relationships for us to consider. Special mother-daughter bonds were handled deftly.I have a friend or two out there (oddly enough, near broad-minded Boston (view spoiler)[Note that I did not say Milford since that would have been specific enough to identify exactly who I meant (hide spoiler)]) who might be tempted to judge a book by its cover, and in this particular case assume \u201cchick lit.\u201d While it does have a female perspective, I personally wouldn\u2019t defile it with such a label. If it\u2019s smart, funny and uplifting, just enjoy it independent of classification, cover and commercial appeal. It didn\u2019t change my life (my new criterion for five stars), but it did lighten the load for a while. At the same time, there was more ballast than you\u2019d expect from, say, Lucille Bluth, Lindsay and Maeby.", "\nI am completely mystified by the love for this book.

Most of the characters are half mad and Bernadette and her daughter Bee lead the way to Lala Land. Here, more actually, to Antarctica. Hijinks ensues. I do think that Maria Semple was inspired by various authors, and all of these authors are still alive. That's my impression at least.What a story! I don't think this is a strictly chick lit book. It's a must read one, and I enjoyed it really thoroughly because of the balancing act that the author conjures out of thin air. I had to knock out one star due to the chaotic and unsatisfying last act, but overall this is a book that will stay with me for a long time.", "Even on the busiest call nights at work, the phrase that never fails to grab my attention regardless of whatever else I may be doing is, \"I hear you like reading. Have you ever read _____?\"That's how I first heard about Where'd You Go, Bernadette. The call night was painfully slow, the wifi was actually working, the Kindle app on my phone was begging for a free sample which turned out to be hilarious, my brain was headed into the 22nd hour of being awake, and the impulse buy predictably happened.I loved it at first, but the closer I got to the finish line the higher my eyebrows climbed and the deeper the eyeballs rolled. Maybe finishing it after getting enough sleep had something to do with the disappearance of giddy happiness and the emergence of the ambivalent noncommittal shrug at what I just read.It starts as a clever satire featuring the cream of the crop of Seattle, Washington - a place where Microsoft has its headquarters and where the people do not live up to the standards of haughty and cultured LA transplants. It's a satire on the privileged world of suburban moms obsessed with the image of their little private schools and the local silly gossip and a satire on the world of Microsoft bubble. Its a satire on the poorly adjusted and not-so-tolerant haughty transplants from the more 'cultured' and 'worldly' places who snigger and judge those around them while relying on the services of an outsourced personal assistant company ($ 0.75 per hour!). It's pieced together from a flurry of emails, letters, post-it notes and tied together by a commentary of a bright teenager in the middle of all the events. And it's such an easy and fun page-turning read - perfectly suited to a slow sleep-deprived call shift at work.\n\nAnd yet the satire ends up resembling - too closely! - the world it satirizes, failing to rise beyond the shallow and easy, failing to bite or sting or really make you care. It fails to do more that remain suitably entertaining, fails to keep its focus on anything that even threatens to become at all uncomfortable, and fails to make enough of an impact to care. It instead remains fluffy and silly and very readable, and giggle-worthy, and ultimately satisfying in the same way Nutella is - strangely addicting but nutrients-poor, and honestly, not contributing much to the (mental) health, and leaving a way-too-sweet aftertaste for hours.\n\n(For a record, I love Nutella.)(And I, regardless of overall disappointment, still had a great time reading this book.)(But neither of them can replace nicely cooked Brussels sprouts.)(Which I also love, for all the right reasons.)(Especially if you add some cheese sauce.)(But that's another story.)", "THIS IS MY ILLUMINAE.By which I mean, \u201cThis is Illuminae if I liked Illuminae, and also instead of being set in space it was set in the Pacific Northwest, and also instead of descriptions of camera footage and server readings it was emails and flyers and whatnot, and also it was the present day, and also instead of teeming with unnecessary romance and the same plotlines over and over it was actually funny and entertaining.\u201dBasically the only thing it has in common with Illuminae is the unique/found-document style formatting.So again, I say: MY ILLUMINAE!!!I read this book a few years ago, when I was young(er) and stupid(er), and I thought it was meh.

Really at any given point I only liked Bernadette and Bee, and even my affections for them were nothing to write home about. Sometimes that can make reading this book grueling.But mostly it is just overwhelmingly funny and creative and entertaining. Even if I hate reading books in which characters go to Antarctica and it only makes me fathom the sheer degree to which I nevereverever want to go there.Bottom line: If you really needed someone to tell you to read this massive bestseller from 2012, which is now being adapted into a star-studded Major Motion Picture - consider this someone telling you.-------pre-reviewWHY ISN'T EVERY BOOK A FUNNY SATIRIC MYSTERY TEEMING WITH QUIRKY CHARACTERS AND FORMATTED MOSTLY IN DOCUMENTS LIKE A NON-FORMULAIC ILLUMINAE????this was so so fun.review to come-------currently-reading update2015 me: thinks this book is fully meh2018 me: is incapable of putting this down.

Quirky and unforgettable characters with a unique and captivating storyline.  This novel was a refreshing change of pace from what I have been reading lately. A silly, unpredictable story with eccentric and entertaining characters that had me laughing out loud. I really liked the way the story unfolded through letters, emails, reports and the narrative of Bee, the daughter of the family. Some of the plot overlapped between these points of narration giving a layered look into what was happening which I thought was done very well. For me, the first half of the book was more intriguing and enjoyable than the second half. My interest was piqued from the start and my curiosity had me flipping the pages as quickly as possible. The second half of the book began to drag in parts and my connection to the storyline lessened. The plot took an unrealistic route (for me) and lost its spark and intrigue. While I still loved the characters and their quirkiness, I wasn\u2019t invested in what was happening to them. This was a Traveling Friends read for the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge. It was a fun book to read and discuss together!Thank you to my lovely local library for lending me this book! ", "4 1/2 magnificent stars!!Another fitting name could be: How Bernadette Got Her Groove Back :pBernadette Fox, a wealthy agoraphobe with a teenage daughter and a semi-absentee (emotionally, anyhow) husband, quite literally disappears before taking off on a family trip to Antarctica.Oh, how fun it is to dislike the witch on wheels (aka the Gnat), Audrey, who then morphs into a slightly-imbalanced but milder version of Bernadette. In my mind, this makes her downright loveable! The character who is truly infuriating is Soo-Lin, but I will say no more in case you want to read the book. Many readers seem to hate on Bernadette's husband Elgie (and with good reason), but if you're the forgiving type like I am, you'll feel compassion toward his character. The only issue with this book is that it seems to end abruptly. However, the mark of a great book is that it leaves you wanting more no matter how it ends, so this feeling is entirely forgivable. If you're looking for a fun, spunky read, then this book will be right up your alley.", "I wasn\u2019t planning to crack the cover of Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette. In fact, I actively resisted reading 2012\u2019s sleeper hit. It has all the makings of something that would send me searching for that elusive \u201cdislike\u201d button. Social satire: Ugh. Chick lit affect (entirely and unfairly due to cover art): Ugh Ugh. Epistolary format with multiple points-of-view (tricksy, metafiction, \u201cI\u2019m a WRITAH\u201d stuff): Ugh Ugh Ugh. Spoofy, anti-Seattle drivel penned by interloper from Southern California (haven\u2019t you all done enough?): Ugh Ugh Ugh Ugh. But there it was, on the $1 table at the library sale. What could I lose but a buck? Okay, so\u2026 I \ntotally\n loved this book. It\u2019s magical. Maria Semple makes me laugh out-Parks-and-Recreation-loud (there\u2019s my obligatory pop culture reference. Maria Semple is a celebrated Hollywood scriptwriter - yes, I know she didn't write for P&R, but that's the one comedy I know- we discovered P&R in Ireland last year and rented several DVDs during the dark hours of life last winter. I haven\u2019t had TV since 1994. My television comedy literacy is stuck someplace between Wings and Murphy Brown. This book tickled the same funny bone as P&R. That's why I bring it up). The book\u2019s magic is multi-fold. Satire often relies on caricature to reflect life\u2019s absurdities, missing the irony that life is so freaking absurd all by itself, there\u2019s no need for a novel to dump on its characters by making them freaks, as well. Semple gives us real people in real time, setting the horizon slightly a-tilt so your balance is off but you aren\u2019t stumbling like a drunk. She blends the bizarre with moments of grace and clarity that reveal the depth of her characters and her themes. Humor works best when it pokes at our most vulnerable spots and shows us that everyone else has those spots, too.The narrative is laid out in a series of e-mails, letters, articles, police reports, TED talk transcripts and department memos written by a cast of adult characters, but the primary point-of-view is delivered in traditional third-person. And this voice belongs to thirteen-year-old Bee, the tiny (congenital heart defect) daughter of Microsoft exec Elgin Branch and his wife, Bernadette. Bernadette, around whom this story foams and eddies, is a once-celebrated architect and a now-wiggy recluse. The contrast of correspondence and detached transcript versus a child\u2019s perspective is a brilliant technique: the adults talk at one another, while the purest, most reliable character addresses the reader directly. Semple\u2019s spoofs are fun-house mirror reflections of layers of upper-middle class American society: oversharing to strangers via the save-face format of e-mail and social media (the exchanges between Bernadette and her $.75/hour personal assistant Manjula, who is based in India, are screamingly funny); the obsession with work and achievement (woe to Microsoft, whose culture is skewered and roasted like a vegan hotdog on a gas grill); dogmatic liberalism \u2013Bee splutters her outrage towards her private school: \u201cTheir class was studying China, and the debate was going to be pro and con Chinese occupation of Tibet. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Galer Street is so ridiculous that is goes beyond PC and turns back in on itself to the point where fourth graders are actually having to debate the advantages of China\u2019s genocide of the Tibetan people, not the mention the equally devastating cultural genocide. This is one bright kid and one whacked-out progressive school. And then there is Seattle. I read an interview last year in which Maria Semple admitted this book was her rant on all that drove her batty about \u201cthis dreary upper-left corner of the Lower Forty-eight\u201d shortly after she moved here; now that she\u2019s been here awhile, she can\u2019t imagine living anyplace else. But there is no malice in her observations (okay, maybe just a wee bit toward Microsoft, but we all revile the place and anyway, it\u2019s not in Seattle); instead, the author works her magic yet again, nailing dead on the bull\u2019s eye all that makes Seattle maddening and lovely. Although the social strata she spoofs could exist anywhere in America\u2019s wealthier reaches, the details she provides are so crazy-true I caught myself gasping with an insider\u2019s recognition. Elgin\u2019s \u201cbike-riding, Subaru-driving, Keen-wearing alter ego\u2026\u201d? Umm\u2026 guilty. Molly Moon\u2019s Salted Caramel ice cream? Jesus. I dream of the stuff. Cliff Mass Weather Blog? The house goes silent at 9 a.m. every Friday so I can listen to Cliff\u2019 prognostications for the week ahead. I can hear his baritone in every syllable of Semple\u2019s transcript. The five-way intersections? Oh. I know EXACTLY where the author (and Bernadette) lost her mind on Queen Anne (though no one calls it Queen Anne Hill, just so\u2019s you know). Yes, they lurk everywhere throughout our fair city. The Microsoft Connecter? I know it waited every morning on 45th in Wallingford for the express purpose of pulling out in front of me as I raced to beat the next light. Daniel\u2019s Broiler on Lake Union? I always wondered who ate there. If anyone I know has, they aren\u2019t admitting it. Blackberry bushes, the Westin, rain? Check check check. Bernadatte rants to a former colleague: \u201cWhat you\u2019ve heard about the rain: it\u2019s all true. So you\u2019d think it would become part of the fabric, especially among the lifers. But every time it rains, and you have to interact with someone, here\u2019s what they\u2019ll say\u201d \u201cCan you believe the weather?\u201d And you want to say \u201cActually, I can believe the weather. What I can\u2019t believe is that I\u2019m actually having a conversation about the weather.\u201d The city, and Bernadette\u2019s reactions to it, are part of the web that bears the weight of Semple\u2019s heavier themes: a lost sense of self, depression, isolation and anxiety. That she can hold it all together with such a deft hand at slapstick comedy without being cruel is yet another form of magic. The plot twists are genius. For Bernadette is not lost just in a metaphorical sense. Semple takes us on a cruise to Antarctica and the book\u2019s title becomes a call that echoes in the blue glaciers of this frozen continent. Hang on \u2013 you might get a little seasick as you try to keep up, but it\u2019s so worth the ride. Maria Semple has written a crazy-good, original, hilarious, sweet and tender novel about a woman falling apart. I think I saw that woman sitting in the window of Starbucks on the corner of Queen Anne Avenue and Boston last winter, laughing to herself. It was raining pretty hard, so I can\u2019t be certain it was she. Maybe it was just my reflection.

And when I say my guy, I mean, the guy who gave me the idea for WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE.

Instead of going out to shop, she has an Indian on-line concierge, Manjula, whom she asks to take care of all sorts of things, adding in to her orders diatribes about diverse things, most particularly the unspeakableness of The Emerald City and of the locals. She refers to them as gnats, seeing them as annoying but not worth the effort of swatting. She has had her name and her husband\u2019s taken off the e-mail list for the private school their daughter attends. The other parents are not amused. Her anti-Seattle rants, however, are hilarious.Maria Semple - image from her Twitter page The house in which the family lives, which Bernadette selected, is the former Strait Gate School for Girls, a reform school. About nine thousand square feet of decrepitude, which once-world-famous-architect, Bernadette Fox, has allowed to fester. The roof has a lot in common with Notre Dame after the fire. Confessionals are excellent places in which, say, a dog might get trapped. Sadly, no revelations occur there. (\u201cBless me Father, for I have sinned. I discarded a totally excellent metaphorical opportunity.\u201d) Blackberry vines, which abound on the considerable hilltop property, are doing an excellent job of intruding into the structure, giving some of the floors a nifty wave-like form. Used dishes are left in drawers for the help to find and clean. No Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval here. And if you think the house makes a lovely metaphor for the state of Bernadette\u2019s life, you get an extra bowl of blackberries. When her unspeakable downhill neighbor, Audrey, demands that she remove the blackberry vines, as they are undermining her retaining wall, Bernadette waves her away with a \u201cfine, whatever,\u201d and agrees to pay for the work, using tech and personnel recommended by said neighbor. It ends badly. Cate Blanchett is Bernadette - image from Yahoo NewsMarriage is not much solace for Bernadette. Hubs, Elgin (aka Elgie) is a top-tier product developer at Microsoft, with a desktop cluttered with patents. He makes a sweet income, loves his work, and loves his wife, but works mad hours and is hardly around. Her primary human connection is Bee, not only her beloved adolescent daughter, but her bff.The plot gets started when Bee wants to cash in a promise made when she was put into her middle school. If she got straight A\u2019s, or whatever it is they give at that school, she could have anything she wants. Kid got \u2018er done, and the ask? Ta-da, a family trip to Antarctica. Just the thing for an agoraphobic mother, but a promise is a promise. Bee won\u2019t accept in substitution the pony she had hoped for several years back. Bernadette supplements her terrors by doing a bit of research and learns that to get to Antarctica one must endure the joys of the aqueous hell known as the Drake Passage (although Dark Passage might be a pretty good fit as well), an oceanic stretch apparently designed on a dare. Emma Nelson as Bee - image from Film ThreatSpeaking of perils to life and limb, Elgin\u2019s new assistant, Soo-Lin, not only has goo-goo eyes for him, but is in league with the chief gnat, Audrey, she of the blackberry removal demand.As the title of the book suggests, Bernadette, after another insult to her dignity, does a runner. It is not much of a mystery where she went, but there is some concern about whether she has actually survived her absconding.Kristin Wiig as AudreyThis is an epistolary novel. Everything is told in communications between sundry characters. The wrap-around frame is Bee as narrator putting it all together in sequence, and offering her commentary. The form works quite well, getting us the intel we need to follow the plot progress, and offering back-story looks through believable devices. I laughed out loud quite a bit for a good chunk of the novel. Bernadette is a very flawed and damaged, but appealing character. Given what we learn, it is understandable that she is through dealing with people, and thus with any opportunity to do what it is she absolutely must do, create. She does keep knitting, though. I know, I know. One could say that she or Elgie should have figuratively shaken her out of this extreme, probably clinical malaise a long time ago, with therapy, an intervention, or whatever methods are thought to work these days to help lost souls get themselves back on track. And I don\u2019t disagree. Very few of us would be able to retreat back into ourselves for such a prolonged stretch without resorting to some form of criminal activity or institutionalization to keep the meals coming. Nevertheless, this is the Bernadette we are presented with, complete with a host of quirks, a scary collection of prescription meds, and epic sleep disorders. It is also the Bernadette who is world-class smart, talented, and professional-level funny when ranting. Whatever is wrong with her, and there is plenty, Bernadette is very engaging. Billy Crudup as Elgin - image from UPROXXBernadette\u2019s ongoing diatribe was the product of Semple\u2019s 2008 move (like Bernadette\u2019s) from LA to Seattle, with her partner, George Meyer, and daughter, Poppy Valentina. I imagine dinnertime repartee to be side-splitting. But it could just be variations on pass the potatoes, and how was your day? Fine.\nI always get inspiration from my own life and just from the emotions and the microtransactions of my life. The books of my life are very much snapshots of my person I was at the time. I remember when I was writing Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette, I really hated Seattle and I was just like trashing Seattle, and I was letting out all this fire about I\u2019m gonna put the hurt on these people who don\u2019t like me. I\u2019ll show them. And it was all just really toxic and horrible. But at the same time I knew it was funny and I was making a comedy. But in the course of writing the book, I started to like Seattle, and I was like, wait, wait. I need to hate you for the purposes of the book. I can hate you later. And so now I love Seattle.  \u2013 from the BEA interviewIt may be that it manifested in the book. I found that the LOL rate declined as one went along. For The Strait Gate, the family residence, film-makers used a building in Pittsburgh. In fact, much of the film was shot there.You may want to bring along some extra strong cables for suspending your disbelief on some elements. The FBI puts in an appearance, then disposes of a problem, which seemed rather dubious (not the core of the problem, only its late manifestation) in the first place, off-screen. Seemed very kludgy to me. During Bernadette\u2019s disappearance (which is pared down to almost nothing in the film, but which is of significant duration in the book) an unfortunate event takes place that kills off some of the humor. It seemed unnecessary. (The film dispenses with this pretty much) I suppose one might see it as bringing the early bad behavior back to a reality base. Maybe give the story a bit more serious edge. The family pooch puts in an emergency-generating appearance early on and is then pretty much discarded.Zoe Chao as Soo-Lin - image from Metro USABottom line is that I enjoyed reading Bernadette, looked forward to my daily encounters, and made (for me) relatively quick work of it. Anything that can make me laugh out loud gets extra points. Which is why I put this at four instead of three stars. The charm of Bernadette and her relationship with her daughter, combined with her uproarious hatred of Seattle (I have my own, different gripes) weighed more than the plot holes and deus ex machina of having enough money to smooth over most material miseries. (Yes, I know it can be argued that Semple is showing that money cannot buy you happiness, and that a less well-off Bernadette might have been forced to face her demons sooner in the absence of such. But as used here, money seemed an easy way to patch over a series of challenges.) So, once your critical faculties are properly adjusted, be prepared to laugh and enjoy.\nAnything I write I ask myself: Is it true, is it entertaining? My way of looking at the world is that if it is true, it is funny and it is dark. No matter how dark it is, I just think it is funny. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ll see something awful on the street and I\u2019ll come home and say to my boyfriend, \u201cI just saw the funniest thing on the street.\u201d It\u2019s a stance.

She says terrifically horrible things but also these deeply-felt things, she is complex and brilliant and depressed and hopeful all at once.

Bee who, since she is a fictional character, I would like to take her hand and introduce her to another young fictional lady from Seattle, Ruby Oliver. The two have a lot to say to each other, I think. Bee is the rare teenage protagonist who shows up in an adult novel acting like an actual teenager. No extra swearing or slang to prove something, no wacked-out diction. Just, a teenager, who is smart, and young, and trying. I will admit--I felt things slow a little when Bernadette disappeared.

Bee is fabulous and a daughter you would be proud to call your own. Elgin?? Weeelll. Let\u2019s just say he comes good in the end. There are some fabulous characters that made me laugh especially Audrey who is utterly ghastly but she redeems herself later on. I love the Seattle setting and the story also takes us to Antarctica and although I have zero desire to go there it is fascinating if only for the penguins. Not sure how they\u2019re going to match this book in the film but is suspect that too will be very entertaining! On a final note can I disabuse Seattleites of the notion that you gave us great coffee. You didn\u2019t. Unless you like it as weak as water. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude09"], "genre": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Contemporary", "Mystery", "Audiobook"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/17626728-where-d-you-go-bernadette", "avg_ratings": "3.90", "ShelvedNumber": "1818"}

Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how this might end. I\u2019ve known it for years.\u201d \u2014 Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don\u2019t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven\u2019t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead\u2019s questions \u2014 and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil\u2019s Snare, Harry\u2019s best mate Ron bellows \u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\u201d Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him \u201cAre you a wizard, or what?\u201d thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling\u2019s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry\u2019s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry\u2019s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret \u201cshout-out\u201d to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that \u201cneither shall live while the other survives\u201d, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn\u2019t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling\u2019s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.", "It's hard for me to believe that I finished the Harry Potter series... I wish this series would go on forever!I don't know how I've gone through my life without these books. I regret not reading it when I was younger, but I am so happy that I finally did, better late than never, right?The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion. This series is more than a story or words on a page, it is magic.", "\nI can't believe its over.... I've FINALLY read the Harry Potter series. And WHAT an ending to the series this book was..Video Review: https://youtu.be/aefPuw_O3n4\n", "Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.", "\n(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: It ends too expository and convenient, but the story's compelling, and its new settings are a nice break from formula.\n", "\nAll was well.\n", "\nSigh... I just can't\n", "\nI hadn't read this book in so long... it's been great to reread it and notice all the details I had forgotten!It was perfect for the holidays (even though this one is quite dark!)\n", "This is just a pithy review on the Harry Potter series as a whole. It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of once\u00b9 when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as \u201cliterature.\u201d I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrong\u2014Rowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.I\u2019ve heard it said before that everything you need to know you\u2019ve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me. And if you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not.\u2022 The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely.\u2022 The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do.\u2022 It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort.\u2022 It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you.\u2022 Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that you\u2019re afraid to fail is failure in itself.Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. It\u2019s a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe that\u2019s an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but that\u2019s what I got out of it, and that\u2019s why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own.\u00b9This is misleading; I\u2019ve been made fun of countless, countless times.", "\u201cWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\u201dHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was the end of an era, and then it wasn't.I can't express how thankful I am, for this series, for this world, for the magic, power and love behind J.K. Rowling's words. I don't know what I would be without Harry Potter.It's crazy how much time I spend reading the books, listening to the audiobooks, watching the films or just thinking about them. So many things between thousands of pages and millions of words. No wonder Harry Potter has such an impact on our society, as it deals with so many topics that have moved, and still move us today, will move us in future:Race and racism for one, hate, ignorance, arrogance and how to fight all of these things. Power and influence of the media, slavery, dictatorship, revolution, feminism, depression, death, loss, equality, love, friendship.J.K. Rowling is probably one of the most important teachers to every child (and adult) reading her books. She shows us, that our dreams are dreamed to become real, that family is who we chose our family to be, that friends can be our greatest strength and that every being, whatever our differences might be, deserves kindness and respect.I still can't believe that this amazing woman was able to put all of this in seven books.Thank you.Find more of my books on Instagram", "\nI loved my #AdamRereadsHP series read so much, especially with Jim Dale's audiobook. This remains the series of my heart.\n", "Wheeeeeere do I even start with this? WHERE. Every human and their bobcat has reviewed this book, but I'M GONNA ANYWAY BECAUSE MY THOUGHTS ARE IMPORTANT. (I am also a Slytherin, FYI.) I'm also really angry because I'm giving it 5-stars because it's so freaking clever. But I've got complaints. But life is short. Eat dessert first. Give books 5-stars. I feel emotionally manipulated by this sneaky paperback, DARN YOU HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. MY LOVE FOR YOU IS COMPLICATED.First: let's talk about the problems:\u2022 The fact that the pacing is rubbish. The beginning borderlines boring. Not enough that I wasn't interested? But enough that I was annoyed. It felt like the book didn't know what to do with the characters if they didn't have Hogwarts classes to get to.\u2022 I'm annoyed that the Slytherins were still labelled at the end as \"badies\". C'mon. Honestly?! Especially in that epilogue when (view spoiler)[Ron (hide spoiler)] says \"don't make friends with Slytherins, kids!\" I mean. Rubbish and growls. (I am a defensive Slytherin, FYI.)\u2022 And speaking of Slytherin's...I kind of thought Harry and Draco might've (view spoiler)[made up or something?? Been tentative friends????? BUT NO??!?! (hide spoiler)] Apparently all the stuff I'd gleaned from the internet is wishful thinking wow.\u2022 There was VERY cliche Voldemort-must-monologue-before-he-kills-stuff scene.\u2022 To be realistic...Harry should've passed out from FOOD DEPRIVATION. Why is not one angry about this? The lad barely ever ate. I was hungry reading this. Someone give the kid a scone.\u2022 I'm annoyed Luna and Neville didn't get more page time. REALLY annoyed.\u2022 I still don't ship the ships. In bk6 I was totally onboard with Harry and Ginny. But now? Meh. They like have no chemistry, sorry. And Hermione and Ron? No. Ron is still a bully and freaking annoying and Hermione could do better....okay. My wrath is out. Now time for the feels. Don't say I didn't warn you.What I Loved:\u2022 My darling baby Neville Longbottom. He is a fantastic creation.\u2022 The plot is clever. Okay seriously IT IS CLEVER. I loved how things tied in and tied up and I loved all the \"reveals\" and it was just clever.\u2022 And the world building is my favourite as always. I want to live a Hogwarts. BUT DOESN'T EVERYBODY?\u2022 Professor MacGonagall. Because she gives life. She is everything. All my love for Professor MacGonagall and her terrific dialogue lines, okay?\u201cOur Headmaster is taking a short break,\" said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.\u2022 I love Harry. I really do. Like at the end there, he was almost a little too perfect, which was a little irritating. But he is a precious little piece of pumpkin juice and I love how he makes mistakes and sometimes needs slapping with a broomstick, but at the end of the day he's just a GOOD KID.\u2022 Obviously Hermione. And I'm glad Ron grew up a lot in this book, because gee that kid was 3 centimetres away from getting his nose punched by moi.\u2022 I hate hate hate hatttttte when the word \"bitch\" is used in a derogatory way towards women. But. There was this scene with Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange = and I liked it. YOU KNOW THE ONE, FOLKS.\u2022 Snape. Omg. Snape. I do agree that his a very complex character. But I still hate him. Why? Because he could've done EVERYTHING just how he needed too -- sans bully children. I get why he hated Harry. I would've hated Harry if James had been like that (question: why the hell did Lily marry James? He was utter trash.) but Neville?! Why did Snape pick on Neville so bad? He literally traumatised my darling baby and I shall not forgive him. I do not \"like\" Snape but I like the complexity of his story.\u2022 THE DEATHS. <3 Okay that sounds marginally sadistic. But hear me out. I hate when big battle finales keep all the \"favourites\" alive. It's dumb and unrealistic. There need to be deaths, and I think HPatDH did it really well. I got all tied up in knots several times.\u2022 I love Luna. She is an amazing special creature and I wish she was in the books more.\u2022 Speaking of which...I have to admire how ALL the characters are just so epic. I would seriously read spin-off series on anyone of them. That takes skill to write even secondary characters so the reader is invested.\u2022 I LIKED IT EVEN THOUGH IT KINDA MANGLED FEELS AND IT FRUSTRATED ME. But it surprised me! When I thought I'd seen all the spoilers of ever. And I was emotionally invested. Omg. I WAS.\u2022 (No tears though. I am a Vulcan.)*** ABOUT THAT EPILOGUE ***Okay but, spoilers about the finale below. (view spoiler)[I am twitchy about the finale. I thought there'd be more. All we know is who married who and how many kids they had and what STUPID names they gave their children. And Harry's son James is basically Harry's father reincarnated. Does that not disturb anyone? *raises hand*But what did Harry and Ginny do? Like did they get a Killed Voldemort Pension and get to retire? Did Harry become an Auror? Why the HECK didn't he get to teach in school? I think he'd been an awesome Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.Did Lunar and Neville marry?Or did Neville save himself for me?What did George do, sans Fred? Like, could George exist without a Fred?Why did Hermione settle so low when she married Ron?What happened to Kreecher? I want to hug Kreecher. I also want him to bring me a sandwich too.Did Professor MacGonagall stay in school to teach or did she scream when she saw Harry's children and say \"I QUIT\"?....I am kind of angry there are no answers to these. (hide spoiler)]Aaaaand...I'M DONE. What else do I say? Yes. I loved it. YES. I love this series. I had a rocky start, and I thought it was dumb. But seriously? If I'd been reading this as a kid. I would been obsessed. As is, I really want to own the books because they're good and they're amazing and they deserve the world-wide cult fandom. It's a satisfying and grand and perfectly wretched finale and I should like to cheer enthusiastically.\u201cOf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\u201d(Also that quote means so much to me I cannot even.)", "Hot take: I like A Very Potter Musical more than I like the Harry Potter series.

Let's talk about it for six pages. I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series for five months. More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February, and I didn\u2019t pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort\u2019s, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let\u2019s talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin\u2019 but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw those glorious GIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like, What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we\u2019re eating? (Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying \u201cAccio salmon\u201d in order to eat and were just like, That information\u2019s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and take literally no effort by the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I\u2019m almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it\u2019s over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I\u2019m big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We\u2019ll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he\u2019s Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he\u2019s treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that\u2019s who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He\u2019s barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we\u2019ll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN\u2019T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT\u2019S \u201cGarry\u201d) just based off of Ginny\u2019s apparent greatness. BUT NO IT\u2019S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn\u2019t be less cute. It\u2019s just I miss Ginnyyyyyyyyy overandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It\u2019s just J.K. Rowling being like, Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here\u2019s a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne, Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer. SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN\u2019S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn\u2019t Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn\u2019t Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she\u2019s all, \u201cWhy won\u2019t Lupin loooooooove me.\u201d Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn\u2019t mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn\u2019t mean that James\u2019s dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don\u2019t just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, \u201cOh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I\u2019ll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!\u201dYou can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She\u2019s a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can\u2019t!!! Because she keeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, \u201cYou and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,\u201d which is really Joanne saying, \u201cI have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?\u201dHere\u2019s one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there\u2019s a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly \u201cdies\u201d when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry that isn\u2019t, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily\u2019s protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I\u2019M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I\u2019M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I\u2019m going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is \u201cget in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.\u201d AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped. either that or this book was garb\u00e0ge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request. (the whole contract is fine print.)ah jesus. you guys thought you hated me before.review to comeeeeee-------------------------me waiting for this book to be over", "happy thanksgiving to everyone celebrating today! we all have so much to be thankful for! this year (and every year), i am immensely thankful for books; but in particular, this series. i know im not original when i say the harry potter books are what made me fall in love with reading. but they gave me a childhood far more magical and imaginative than i could have ever asked for. they opened my eyes to a world beyond the one in which i lived. the series taught me the value of empathy, that courage comes in many different forms, the importance of having and being a true friend, that love is the greatest power above all, and most importantly, it taught me to believe in magic. i would not be who i am today without these books and i love that stories have the power to do that, to change lives for the better. i owe so much to this series, which became such a massive part of my life. and for that, i will be forever thankful. <3\u21a0 5 stars", "First of all, It's awesome finding out that this book is Dedicated specially to you by the Queen herself -for me Joanna Rowling is the English Queen for Magic, just as there's a Queen for muggles- & it's Really yours personally..If you Stuck With Harry Until The Very End.I've been stuck with Harry myself for 10 years now..when I first read the Arabic edition of the 1st book on Sep.2003.. I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape. **How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione.We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events. But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story.. I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn   The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.\u0650\u0650And look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. But before you try to kill me, I\u2019d advise you to think about what you\u2019ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. \u201cIt\u2019s your one last chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s all you\u2019ve got left. . . . I\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .\u201d  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of Love So glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

I\u2019m thrilled to say that I managed to follow through with at least one book related commitment this year, and that was to read the entire Harry Potter series for the first time. It\u2019s tough to pick a favorite from the group, but the Deathly Hallows is a worthy contender for that coveted first spot. As the dark tension that began growing at the finish of the Goblet of Fire has come full circle, I felt this was the perfect finale to a (rightfully) highly acclaimed series. I\u2019m so happy to have finally experienced first hand this beloved story arc that so many readers hold dear to their heart.

I did. The Prince's Tale gets to me every time. The epilogue seems to belong to Cursed Child more than to Deathly Hallows, but J.K.

Not just the books, but we kinda aged with him (or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And we were there together. We were at midnight release parties and movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, and theme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well.", "\nI always wonder how the characters are doing after a series ends\ud83e\udd14\n", "\nI remember when the hardback came out. Wal-Mart was having a big to do at midnight but I worked 3rd shift at the post office at that time. I stopped by after work around 7 ish am and there were a few copies left.

This series never lost any momentum and here it ended spectacularly in such a dramatic final confrontation.  2. Rowling shows us that even the nastiest of people deserve a degree of sympathy.

He accepts that he must die and understands that there are far worse things in the living world than dying.\u201d  -Albus Dumbledore \nTo you, yes you, reader of this review\n, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you\u2019ll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t been warned.^^\nTo J.K. Rowling, \nthere is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can\u2019t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you\u2019re still human and surely you\u2019ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can\u2019t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? Haven\u2019t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don\u2019t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don\u2019t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don\u2019t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor Moody\u2019s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn\u2019t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings. \nTo Harry Potter\n, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.  \nTo Hermione Granger \n, you are the most kick-ass heroine I\u2019ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest. \nTo Ron Weasley\n, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.  \nTo Fred and George\n, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, it\u2019s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)] \nTo Hagrid (and Graupy) \n, *hugs* I\u2019ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.  \nTo Professor Snape,\nyou are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails* \nTo Professor Dumbledore\n, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving. \nTo Dumbledore\u2019s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,\n, you guys are awesome! \nTo the Order of the Phoenix,\n you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I\u2019m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much. \nTo the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall\n, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant! \nTo the Malfoys,\nuh I don\u2019t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you! \nTo Dobby, \n *wails* I can\u2019t\u2026just thank you so much. You\u2019re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know. \nTo Kreacher,\n you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are.

Thank you! *wails* \nTo the movie makers and actors\n, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^\nTo my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,\n thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.\nTo Jia and Kyra\n, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday).

Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.'\nit still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters.maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her \" Loony \" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville.like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now.This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,,(view spoiler)[ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more.   (hide spoiler)]I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K. Rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person. Thank you very much, Mrs. J. K. Rowling and thank you very much for reading this guys. \u2764\u2764\u2764P.S. I found all these wonderful pictures on Google. Many thanks for the creators.", "***SPOILERS:From an interview with Rowling on the Today show:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19...Rowling said her original epilogue was \u201ca lot more detailed,\u201d including the name of every child born to the Weasley clan in the past 19 years. (Victoire, who was snogging Teddy \u2014 Lupin and Tonks\u2019 son \u2014 is Bill and Fleur\u2019s eldest.)Harry, Ron and HermioneWe know that Harry marries Ginny and has three kids, essentially, as Rowling explains, creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child.As for his occupation, Harry, along with Ron, is working at the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. After all these years, Harry is now the department head.\u201cHarry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cThey are now the experts. It doesn\u2019t matter how old they are or what else they\u2019ve done.\u201dMeanwhile, Hermione, Ron\u2019s wife, is \u201cpretty high up\u201d in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in \u201cDeathly Hallows.\u201d\u201cI would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding,\u201d Rowling said.Harry, Ron and Hermione don\u2019t join the same Ministry of Magic they had been at odds with for years; they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a \u201creally good place to be.\u201d\u201cThey made a new world,\u201d Rowling said.The wizarding naturalistLuna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum.\u201cI think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cShe\u2019s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.\u201dLuna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don\u2019t exist.\u201cBut I do think that she\u2019s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Rowling said.Luna and Neville Longbottom?It\u2019s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A.When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling\u2019s response was \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to \u201cfeel a bit of a pull\u201d between the unlikely pair.Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise \u201cfelt too neat.\u201dMr. and Mrs. Longbottom: \u201cThe damage is done.\u201dThere is no chance, however, that Neville\u2019s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies.\u201cI know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville\u2019s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry\u2019s parents,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cThe damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.\u201dRowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother\u2019s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts.The fate of HogwartsNineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (\u201cMcGonagall was really getting on a bit\u201d) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort\u2019s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.While Rowling didn\u2019t clarify whether Harry, Ron and Hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year, she did say she could see Harry popping up every now and again to give the \u201codd talk\u201d on Defense Against the D", "4.75 Golden StarsEnd of an Epic journey,7 books full of magic & fun & friendship.7 books of constant thrills7 precious gemsIt's the last station.We're in the Endgame now.I loved the second half of this book wholeheartedly! it was thrilling & wonderful how it was going on! how they were enlightened by the information. how they solved the mystery! how they reacted, planned & how it ended. it was EPIC!the first half was mysterious too.

{"published_year": "2011", "rating_counts": "381003", "ISBN": null, "description": "100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical \u2013 and sometimes devastating \u2013 breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420585954l/23692271.jpg", "title": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", "authors": "Yuval Noah Harari", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens", "reviews": ["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is a book bound to appear on a large number of coffee tables and favorite lists, and be picked up even by those who normally would not find the time for reading. It will certainly not be the next A Brief History of Time, which is often named as the world's top unfinished popular bestseller.Both A Brief History of Time and Sapiens share a similar, worthy goal - to explain complex issues in a way which can actually be understood and comprehended by most people. Just as A Brief History... aimed at explaining cosmology to a lay audience, Sapiens aims to provide a readable and concise historical summary of the progress of human evolution - all in under 500 pages.Is this possible? Of course not - histories of individual countries often take up several volumes, and histories of entire civilizations and ultimately an entire specie would take up hundreds if not thousands of volumes. Because Harari's book is limited to just a single volume (and a relatively short one at that), he has to severely limit his scope to what he considers to be the biggest life-changing developments of our species, which essentially reduces it to a collection of trivia about these events. But that's not the true flaw of the book. Sapiens begins strong enough with a very interesting presentation of early human history and development of early human species, which culminated in the rise and eventual dominance of our own - the Homo Sapiens. However, the rest of the book consists largely of author's own musings and thoughts about the human condition and character - while some of these thoughts I find interesting and agreeable (such as our collective belief in the value of money), one thesis he that he put forward struck me as truly bizarre.Basically, Harari considers the agricultural revolution to be \"history's biggest fraud\", which instead of improvement left humans who settled down to farm worse off and more miserable than their nomadic, foraging ancestors. To prove his point, Harari waxes poetics about hunter-gatherers and their daily existence: they lived in egalitarian communes where property and love was freely shared, and were much more adept at survival in the wilderness than their descendants who plowed the fields. Hunter-gatherers had to have a much larger knowledge of their surroundings, and possessed vastly superior mental reflexes and physical dexterity which put future generations to shame. Although we have since gained vast knowledge as a collective, Harari argues that on the individual level ancient foragers were \"the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history\".For Harari, our foraging ancestors were not only mental and physical supermen, but also enjoyed a much more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than all the subsequent peasants, workers and office clerks. They worked fewer hours and since they had no homes, they also had no household chores; this allowed for plenty of free time to play with one another, tell stories and just hang out. Since foraging necessitated exploration, it also provided plenty of adventure: what better thing to do than explore new places to look for cool plants and other edible things? Because they were always on the move and therefore not dependent on a single source of food, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a superior, multi-nutrient diet and were less likely to suffer from hunger and starvation than subsequent agricultural societies, which often depended on a single crop, and not only were receiving much less nutrients but also suffered heavily from famines when their food source failed. Farming? Bah! Humbug.True, there were some drawbacks, Harari reluctantly agrees. Although some lucky souls made it longer, life expectancy averaged only 30 to 40 years. Children dropped dead like flies, and sometimes wild tigers came out of the bushes and ate you and your whole family and tribe. Not to mention that sometimes you and your band wandered and wandered, and the food simply wasn't there. Or even worse - the food was there, but so was another tribe which was not exactly keen on sharing their already limited supply. What about this? \"It would be a mistake to idealize the lives of these ancients\", says the author, though I do not really understand why, since this is exactly what he appeared to be doing, \"though they lived better lives than most people in agricultural and industrial societies, their world could still be harsh and unforgiving.\" Ain't that the truth. Sometimes, life is just hard. Rocks fall, everyone dies. But agricultural revolution? It sucked, Harari argues. First, he has unnamed (and presumably fictitious) scholars proclaim the development of agriculture as \"a great leap forward for humanity\", which \"produced ever more intelligent people(...)able to decipher nature\u2019s secrets\". But this is not true - \"there is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time\", he says, as \"foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered\". As I mentioned above, Harari states that agricultural revolution made things worse for farmers - it robbed them from excitement of hunting and gathering by forcing them to settle down next to their fields and perform menial farm work, which strained our joints and spine. Although farming provided a surplus of food it did not provide the farmer with a better diet, robbing us of the diversity of meals experienced by a hunter-gatherer. Farming also failed to provide us with economic security - crops can always fail and lead to hunger, whereas hunter-gatherers can always move on and hunt for other types of food (unless, of course, they do not find any and starve to death). Farmers also had to stay and defend their land if attacked by a hostile group, whereas foragers could always escape to another area, look for food there, and survive (they could, of course, end up not being able to escape -who can fight or run on an empty stomach? - or...not find any food, and starve to death).So, what exactly has agriculture ever done for us? Since it has taken so much not only from our fathers but also from from our fathers' fathers, what has it ever given us in return? The aqueduct? Sanitation? Wine? And why have humans not returned to hunting and gathering but stubbornly toiled their fields and broke their miserable backs, while they could be climbing trees and camping in the wilderness? The answer is simple: more food allowed women to have children more often, and even though they still died fairly often this time births outpaced deaths several times. Village population increased, and soon entire generations of people no longer remembered the good old days of running in the forests and looking for berries. \"The trap\", Harari writes, \"was shut\".He goes on to say: \"Since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement\".Yet, we are wrong in thinking this, because \"it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today\" (though apparently not when it comes to foraging, which was a blast by all accounts - that is, the author's). Harari neglects to mention the exact reason why the agricultural revolution took place - farming first arose in places where hunting and gathering was no longer possible, and in the long run prevailed as the better option. Hunter-gatherers simply did not choose to one day walk out of the woods and start domesticating animals and plants; they were forced to do that because the environment they were living no longer allowed for foraging to remain a viable option. The Younger Dryas interval in ancient Levant is often linked to the adoption of agriculture in the region, as an example of the first deliberate cultivation of plants. People understood that seeds developed into plants at the time when they desperately needed to increase their food supply in order to survive, and linked one with the other.It is interesting that Harari does not only romanticize hunting and gathering, but actually looks at the agricultural revolution and its impact from a perspective of a hunter and gatherer - that is, focusing on the thing that mattered most to our foraging ancient ancestors: food. Hunter-gatherers spend their lives pursuing food; as Harari admits, because of their nomadic lifestyle they had very few possessions, as they were constantly moving around in search for food to sustain them. Food was their driving force; their lives centered around food, as they never had a steady supply of it and always had to hunt and look for more if they were to survive. In contrast, agricultural revolution provided humans with a steady and regular supply of food, and or the first time in our history allowed humans to take our minds off food and constant travel. The impact of this is monumental and cannot be stressed enough. Basically, without agricultural revolution, our knowledge would be stagnant - as we would simply not have the luxury of time to develop it. Food surplus and settling down allowed humans to think more and develop new ideas and technologies, allowing for more efficient farming - which in turn allowed for more time to think and develop even more ideas and technologies. In contrast to general knowledge of our forager ancestors, surplus of food and settler lifestyle allowed for skill specialization, which in turn allowed us to do things beyond their wildest dreams, and become technologically advanced. Basically, I would argue that societies comprised of hunter-gatherers cannot advance and live up to the full human potential - it is impossible to have a truly technologically advanced nomadic society, while it is possible to have a technologically advanced settler society which is able to send some of its members into the world as hunter-gatherers. To put it very simply: hunter-gatherers live in the wilderness, living day to day on what they find or hunt down, while agriculturists discover penicillin, split the atom and fly into space.Although the author later brings up valid concerns about our treatment of animals and abuse of collective power, his rant against agriculture is truly bizarre considering that without it he would not be able to write this very book. It's as if he disregarded the very Sapiens which he aimed to describe, and which has defied his thesis by abandoning hunting and gathering to settle down and farm. Still, there are good parts and certain valuable and interesting insights in this book - it's just a shame that it's tainted with such a weird and contrived chapter.", "This book is a superficial gloss on human history. Nice try but it excludes too much data in favor of an overarching conceptual view to be deeply interesting. Stopped reading for reasons detailed below at p. 304 of 416.Considering the outlandishness of some of its claims\u2014the downside of the Agricultural Revolution, the joys of Empire\u2014the book seems weirdly under-sourced. The bibliography is beyond meagre. Don't get me wrong, I like a little informed speculation as much as anyone. Take for example the claim that houses, their advent, \"became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature.\" (p. 99) I, for one, would be delighted to know how one can discern the psychology of someone who lived more than 9,000 years ago. The apparently relevant note cited is \"2 Robert B. Marks, The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Ecological Narrative\". But when one looks up Mr. Marks' book one sees that it pertains only to the 15th to the 21st centuries CE.Another thing, the book seems all biological determinism\u2014and we know what that sort of thinking led to: the Konzentrationslager. The life of the mind is nothing here, the intellect nothing, all because it has no discernible basis in biology\u2014so reductive and materialist, too. I'm hoping this is just a rhetorical device. Please, let it be. Moreover, the author cherishes a certain sneering and glib tone which I find annoying. Well, yes, now he's changing his tune, isn't he? But not before thoroughly pissing me off. Was that necessary? Ah, now he's starting to celebrate the very social constructs\u2014the law, the state, joint stock corporations, etc.\u2014that he so glibly belittled as \"imaginary myths\" a few pages back. So his earlier arguments were disingenuous. That's not something I prize in a writer. Notwithstanding the questionable attempt to raise the reader's hackles, just mentioned, I find myself on p. 170 and 95% of this is material I already know. Granted, the author tries to package it as felicitously as possible, but it's still stuff I know and, no doubt, material my well read GR friends will also know. What I had hoped for on cracking this formidable spine was something far more intellectually challenging, like Naipaul. Still, I find myself nursing a hope that this is just an overly long introduction to a thrilling thesis. At the same time I fear it will turn out to be another tedious read for a far less learned general reader than myself. Am I overqualified for this book? Trepidation abounds. 2.0 stars so far, inauspicious. Meh. It's really an undergraduate survey course, if that. It's a great review of common knowledge that seeks to find new linkages and epiphanies. It sometimes works. But often the linkages are specious. As when he terms liberal humanism a religion. It isn't, though it's a neat shorthand for his minimalist theories. Now I'm reading about how religions are unifiers. The author certainly has a flair for the obvious, I'll say that much. Here's an example of author Harari's reductiveness, which is inevitable in a book skirting so many vast subjects. On p. 232 we read: \"The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman.\" Nietzsche is nowhere mentioned. The statement is wholly lacking in context\u2014the Nazis are glossed but that's all. It really doesn't make coherent sense. Gloss, that's the word that best describes this book. A gloss.The writer is careless with metaphors. We're told that cultures are \"mental parasites,\" that \"history disregards the happiness of individuals\" and that \"history made its most momentous choice.\" (p. 243-244). To say such things is to give agency to the non-sentient and adds to the narrative's by now utterly grating superficiality. Here's yet another bizarro statement:Had the Aztecs and Incas shown a bit more interest in the world surrounding them \u2013 and had they known what the Spaniards had done to their neighbors \u2013 they might have resisted the Spanish conquest more keenly and successfully. (p.292)Nonsense. The Spaniards had guns, germs and steel. Reread Jared Diamond and William H. Prescott, Mr. Harari. Foreknowledge would have availed the indigenous peoples little or nothing. The author goes on to admit as much in the paragraphs to follow, but why then wasn't that earlier sentence cut? But it gets better: If the subject peoples of the Inca Empire had known the fates of the inhabitants of Mexico, they would not have thrown in their lot with the invaders. But they did not now....[Thus] the native peoples of America...[paid] a heavy price for their parochial outlook.It's astonishing the author should use that ecclesiastical word. For what was the ostensible motivation of the conquerors but the glory of Christendom. Harari is blaming the victims. The world view of the Aztecs and Incas and others was limited. Harari blames them because they had not yet advanced beyond that basic if incomplete awareness. He then goes on to excoriate all of Asia and Africa for not having had the wherewithal to explore the world and conquer others. But these are cultural predilections, not standardized goals applicable to all. This leads to an unseemly West is the Best argument that's right out of Niall Ferguson's Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order. Is this book popular because it essentially functions as the West's cheering section? It's lovely we have developed science and technology and historiography etc. I'm glad I live in the West. But it's absurd to say that earlier cultures, because they did not develop in a timely manner our own particular brand of curiosity, were deficient. All cultures are blood soaked, our own included. The world is only what it is, not some counter-factual supposition.", "\nIs there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don't know what they want?\nWhat a fantastic book. I can see why everyone from Bill Gates to Barack Obama was raving about it. It's an extremely compelling, accessible history - almost like a novelization - of humankind.I've read a few of these \"brief history of the world\" books, most notably  A History of the World in 100 Objects and Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything. I liked both, but neither is as engaging as this book. Also, Harari's book stays vague on the physics, dinosaurs and such, unlike Bryson's work, making this not so much about the whole universe, but specifically about humans. Or, I should clarify, homo sapiens.Most of all, I like how easy to digest the author makes all this information. I have a lot of respect for authors who can present something complex in simple terms. I've always liked the quote attributed to Einstein \u201cIf You Can\u2019t Explain it to a Six Year Old, You Don\u2019t Understand it Yourself\u201d. Anyone with a thesaurus can make something seem more dense and complicated than it is; it's much harder to explain something long and complicated in a way that everyone can enjoy.And it does read like a really exciting and fascinating novel. Harari takes us through the history of human development and migration, through the Cognitive Revolution (view spoiler)[a sudden increase in cognitive ability around 70,000 years ago, not the 1950s intellectual movement (hide spoiler)] and Agricultural Revolution. He looks at how currency and coinage developed, the creation of religions, the arrival of imperialism and capitalism, and the history of inequalities and injustices.I especially like how he presents a relatively unbiased view of events. He focuses on what we know, and is quick to say when something remains a mystery to biologists and anthropologists. When there are conflicting theories, he outlines all the main ones. The only agenda Hariri seems driven by is a desire to present the most accurate view of humanity's history.This book filled me with a sense of wonder. Wonder at how far we've come in just a few millennia; wonder at all the twisting roads of history; wonder at where we could possibly end up. The final chapters of the book take a peek at the future's possibility, making me even more excited (and a little scared) to read  Homo Deus.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "I believe I am relatively familiar with history in general, and I'm usually not very excited about reading more about it. But this book was something else. Beautifully written and easy to read, this book just made me want to know more and more about how the author thinks the world evolved to what it is today. Revolution by revolution, religion by religion, conception by conception, things were simplified and yet still maintained valid points - and it was never boring.The best thing about it was that it actually made me think.The author doesn't treat you as ignorant at all - he doesn't assume you know nothing but assume you know a lot and understand a lot, and doesn't lecture about anything, and that attitude makes the book a pleasure to read.Just read it.", "\nThis book had changed my life, the way I think, the way I precept the world.I think it should be an obligatory book for everyone on this planet.\n", "Had I stopped reading after the first section, I\u2019d have given this a five stars and whined that the Goodreads platform doesn\u2019t aloe reviewers to go higher. But I didn\u2019t stop. I kept reading, . . . until it got so bad, I found myself unable to do more than skim, and eventually, to just skipping large chunks.It starts out as a fascinating discussion of the development and rise of our species, homo sapiens. But starting in the second section on the Agricultural Revolution, Harari shift gears and drops any pretense of an scholarly work. From that point on, it\u2019s all personal bias all the time. This guy absolutely hates human beings and society. It seems that he is completely stuck in the idea that the world would have been better off had humanity simply stayed put in the hunter-gatherer stage.It seems all the countless billions of humans who lived since then are deluded and don't get it, and that only he understands. Yeah, right!OK. There are worse sins than personal bias. Many great writers have it and let it show. But unlike Harari, the good ones work to try to justify the positions they take. Harari, on the other hand just bombards readers with one opinion after another and treats them as proven fact, even though what he says is often debatable or out and out wrong. That\u2019s one of the reasons I gave up on a close reading as I progressed into the second half. Even when it seemed as if Harari was selling me something I didn\u2019t know (which did not occur often), I simply did not trust him. An author can choose to forego many things. Credibility and trust are not among them.Perhaps the best way to illustrate this mess is through a conversation I once had among people who liked to discuss philosophy. Somehow or other, though, this conversation veered off into a set of irritating rants on how western society sucks. The thing that sticks out most in my memory is how the host went off on a diatribe about the greatness of nature and Native Americans and about how he was fine being a non-vegetarian because the cows understood human need for meat and were happy to offer themselves as a precious spiritual gift to humanity. My reply: \u201cThat conclusion is based on interviews with how many cows?\u201d The conversation abruptly ended. That is exactly the way I reacted to the self-serving gibberish offered by Harari under the guise of scholarly presentation. ", "It is again unpopular opinion time! It seems it becomes a rule for me not to enjoy a book that everyone seems to love. Well, someone has to. Here we go with the review. Prepare your tomatoes and raw eggs (someone actually threw a raw egg at me once for fun but it bounced from my bum \uf04a)Sapiens\u2019 beginning was fantastic. I loved the author\u2019s voice and the information about the early days of the human kind was fascinating. I did not read any non-fiction about the origin of humans so I was excited to understand our origins better. I could not stop highlighting interesting passages to include in my review or to read later. Here are some of the ones that picked my interest.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to agree that only Homo sapiens can speak about things that don\u2019t really exist, and believe six impossible things before breakfast. You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.\u201d\u201cTelling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals.\u201dHowever, everything started to go downhill from somewhere in the middle of Part II. From an eager and excited reader I slowly became pissed off, disappointed and struggled to finish. I had several problems that plagued my reading experience and I plan to exemplify them below. First of all, I soon grew tired of the author\u2019s ironic and condescending humor. His ego was transpiring from all his words and his personal opinions and the way he tried to enforce them annoyed me more and more. Secondly, I felt like many of his assumptions and extrapolations had no proof and they only represent the author\u2019s personal opinion. For example, the way he supported for the whole book that humans were better of as hunter-gathers without bringing no real arguments to support his opinion.Finally, I had a problem with the scope of Sapiens. As the titles suggests, the book tries to be A Brief History of Humankind. I believe he did not succeed very well to do that and the reason is that it is quite impossible to do what the author planned in less than 500 pages. The task is too vast. The result is mix of everything with no structure, jumping from one subject to another and confusing the reader. The information was too vague, too general, it all resembled a set of interesting trivia.When reading other negative reviews of Sapiens I stumbled repeatedly on a recommendation: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. The book was already on my TBR so it is going to be the next read on the subject. I hope it will be better.", "I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none. Instead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conquer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage.Harari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence.I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.[I also have a frivolous review of the book here.]", "History and Sociology for Dummies, this book is almost irrecoverably watered down intellectually. [and for all those commenters that think I am calling them dummies, I am simply referring to the popular XXX For Dummies books and I am not intentionally insulting folks that enjoyed the book.] Sapiens does make some interesting points and probably opens a few debates, but it disappointed me. There are lots of soundbites here, especially the oft-quoted one about the agricultural revolution being \"history's greatest ripoff\", but they remain soundbites because they never really reach a conclusion. The book starts out alright was the hunter-gatherer civilizations are discussed in some detail and without focusing exclusively on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Harari's chapters here did make for decent reading about the concept the author calls the cognitive revolution which separates us from other animals. Unfortunately, the next section about the agricultural revolution is a bit too polemical. Yes, it was a radical change and yes it did lead to new problems (disease, famine, etc), but without it, the human species would likely have never evolved to the point of me typing this text on my laptop and you reading it in a browser. There are not parallel paths proposed, just a vague condemnation of agriculture before he takes on the subject of religions. Here, he talks of the evolution of monotheism from the polytheistic systems that abounded before. I felt he did not discuss in sufficient death the animist systems (which still dominate Africa, South America, and the Arctic among others.) He seems to favor Buddhism (the pages there have a much more tolerant and fawning tone than those of the other religions) which seemed a little intellectually dishonest to me - I mean if he is trying to develop a dispassionate argument about how religions develop, he should not take a particular position without announcing it first. Anyway, after this, the book covers the industrial revolution and brings us up to modern times. Honestly, I felt that the end of the book really soured the whole product for me. Well, I was already annoyed with all the cute phrases and the prolific use of \"!\" at the end of 20% of the sentences (OK, I am exaggerating but seriously, a \"history\" book shouldn't use the exclamation point says the snob reviewer). But when the author sets up an argument about where we should be headed as a human race, he then goes off on bizarre tangents about cyber technology and refers to an obscure Project Gilgamesh (which unless I missed something major earlier in the book, he never mentioned before). I felt that the last chapter just came out of nowhere and made absolutely no sense. Perhaps, as other reviews here on GR have suspected, no one actually reads this book, preferring to leave it unsullied on their coffee table as a prop to their showoff intellectualism. In any case, it didn't do it for me.Unfortunately, my in-laws who bought me Sapiens also bought me the sequel so I suppose I will be guilted into reading it at some point. In conclusion, I prefer reading REAL history books with caffeine rather than this decaffeinated, saccharin substitute for them. I would highly suggest the more factual and far less polemical Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies which deals with a similar topic, but without the excessive punctuation (!).I am not alone in my disdain for this over-publicized waste of trees. A friend passed me this article: https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public... in which the author concludes: \"But Sapiens provides us with no resources for answering questions about the moral implications of scientific and technological change. A commitment to a reductionist, mechanistic view of Homo sapiens may give us some insight into some of the aspects of our past most tied to our material nature. But Harari\u2019s view of culture and of ethical norms as fundamentally fictional makes impossible any coherent moral framework for thinking about and shaping our future. And it asks us to pretend that we are not what we know ourselves to be \u2014 thinking and feeling subjects, moral agents with free will, and social beings whose culture builds upon the facts of the physical world but is not limited to them.\"This book is waaaaay overrated.As an aside, I wanted to briefly talk compare The Overstory and The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate \u2013 Discoveries from a Secret World with this book. In the Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, the author bemoans the wanton destruction caused by the agricultural revolution, but to my mind proposes no alternative and just leaves the reader with empty, vacuous soundbites. In the former two books, we are given a vast insight into how trees communicate and how they are intimately related to human beings. Yes, our ignorance of their speech (as alien to us as would be expected because our life spans and perception of time is on the same magnitude as that of flies to humans) has caused irreparable damage to the ecosystem. And there is an obvious domino effect: global warming and climate change. But, in the two books about trees, even if a militant outlook is shown to be a dead-end, it is demonstrated that being custodians of nature, we can help forests come back and preserve our biodiversity. It is not all of humankind that is to blame, as Harari would have us believe, but rather, rapacious grift driving large corporations which reap a direct, short-term financial benefit from wholesale environmental destruction. If the law was enforced rather than trampled upon, the jobs could be converted to conservation-related jobs and the forests could be preserved. I found that this positive message was stronger than any of the superficial aphorisms in Harari's book.", "Choose Your Fictions CarefullyThere are far too many fascinating assertions in this book to even mention. But for me the most fascinating is Harari\u2019s idea of the Cognitive Revolution which took place about 70,000 years ago. \"We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it\u2019s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes.\"It is this mysterious, and as yet unexplained, change in human genetics that he pinpoints as the primary reason for the ultimate success of the species Homo Sapiens in competition not just with established flora and fauna but with other human forms. Interestingly, Harari\u2019s argument also establishes the anthropological foundations for literary post-modernism.To over-simplify, but not by much, the Cognitive Revolution of Sapiens is precisely the ability to tell, and eventually read and write, stories, that is, fictional narratives which are interesting, entertaining, and above all convincing. This ability, an evolutionary enigma because it does not give obviously immediate advantage, underlies human ability to organize beyond very small units, to cooperate in matters of survival, and to prevail against competing species which are stronger, quicker, better adapted to the environment, able to speak in a more varied manner, and even more clever.These narratives, according to the narrative told by Harari, begin in gossip, talk among ourselves about ourselves, which is a behaviour that is now as far as anyone knows unique to Homo Sapiens, and may even have even been unique among others of the genus Homo. Gossip leads to shared tales about common experiences, ancestors, and problems. These tales evolve into myths which are widely shared and identify large groups as \u2018us\u2019. \"There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.\"Such tales incrementally employ an increasing lexicon of fictional, that is to say abstract, ideas. It is these ideas which allow the ultimate success of Sapiens, not necessarily because of their pragmatic qualities, but because, whatever they are, they are shared: \u201cMyths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail\u2019s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.\u201dAs modern existential and linguistic philosophers have thought for some time, these ideas - scientific, religious, technological, social, legal - are fundamental fictions that become progressively indistinguishable from the \u2018natural\u2019 world which is apart from the imagined world of language. As Harari states what is a reiteration of this philosophical conclusion: \u201cThree main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:... a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world... b. The imagined order shapes our desires... c. The imagined order is inter-subjective.\u201dIt is this invisibility of these linguistic fictions which constitute daily life that is both the greatest strength and greatest flaw of our species. We are able to organise ourselves, because of them, to travel to the Moon. We are also able to believe a half dozen untruths before breakfast. The internet is perhaps the best example of the paradox of our fraught existence since it promotes both cooperation and mass deceit. For me the implications are clear: 1) literature is the only hope for the world. Fiction - novels, fairy tales, fantasies, and lots of 'em - are the only means to get a grip on reality. Reading lots of fiction developes the aesthetic sense. And it is only through aesthetics that one can decide what is important and how to deal with what is important. 2) It is also clear to me that novels cultivated our species genetically over millennia for this very reason - to get us better at reading them.Postscript: For a rather plausible opposing view to Harari\u2019s, see: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...", "\u201dDespite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles \u2013 but nobody knows where we\u2019re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.\u201d\n\nCave of the Hands. Cueva de las manos in Argentina. The art in this cave dates from 13,000 to 9,000 years ago. I find this photograph to be very emotional to think about because this band of Humans are saying...we were here.The pursuit of happiness is one of the many big themes that Yuval Noah Harari covers in this remarkable book about the history of Homo Sapiens. He brings us from the beginning of our known history to the present and offers his interpretations and evaluations of our conduct along the way. There are many points in the book where he crystallized my thinking about a subject, and there are several other points where he encouraged me to think about what I know in different ways. Since taking myself out of the rat race, I\u2019ve had a lot of time to ponder exactly what I was trying to accomplish for the 30+ years I pursued money and career advancement. Now, I want to make sure with what time I have left to spend it pursuing something much more meaningful and satisfying than the pursuit of more and more money. This book will make you uncomfortable. You may disagree with some of his conclusions, but do not use that as an excuse to not read the book. He will also enlighten you on other points that very well may help shape your personal philosophy. I have been thinking about reading the book for some time, but what convinced me was all the one star reviews for the book on Amazon. It was quickly apparent to me that most of those reviews were written by religious people who never read the book but were told they should be offended by it because of his opinions on religion. He doesn\u2019t just believe that Christianity is a fabricated construct, but also thinks that nationalism and a whole host of other -isms are as well. \u201dHow do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism?\u201dOr how about this one?\u201dIt may well be that we\u2019d all be better off if Christianity and Islam had been forgotten or defeated.\u201dWhy did Constantine the Great pick Christianity as the religion of the empire? We really don\u2019t know. It was far from a dominant religion at the time. Harari compares it to a POTUS waking up one morning and deciding that the Hare Krishnas are the national religion. It is hard to fathom that it was a moment of altruism. He was an intelligent man and must have felt that Christianity offered the best way to better control his people and unite them under one concept, instead of the host of gods that polytheism offered. I come away from this book realizing how deeply brainwashed I\u2019ve been about a whole host of issues, and I have been remiss in not questioning more of the foundations of thought or intent behind most of my long held beliefs. The big revelatory moment for me was when he talked about individualism. \u201dThe state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. \u2018Become individuals,\u2019 they said. \u2018Marry whomever you desire, without asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner. You are no longer dependent on your family or your community. We, the state and the market, will take care of you instead. We will provide food, shelter, education, health, welfare and employment. We will provide pensions, insurance and protection.\u2019 Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them.\u201dHow often do we hear the term \u201cstand on your own two feet?\u201d Or \u201cpull yourself up by your own bootstraps?\u201d Looking for help from others in current culture is seen as a sign of weakness. Standing as individuals has made us weaker, not stronger. We are accused of a form of co-dependency if we are too attached to our extended family or our friends. I\u2019d never really thought about how being individualistic was actually helping the powers-that-be to exert more control us. We are experiencing a great divide in politics, and many of my friends have already decided they won\u2019t be going home for the holidays. We used to be able to set disagreements aside and focus on what we do agree on, like...baseball or reading books or the weather, but now politics has become such a defining part of our lives that we feel like those who disagree with us are actually immoral. Have all these technological advances made us happier? To a degree yes, but also very unhappy in other aspects. The demands on our attention are more immediate and all consuming. Even when we relax, we are not really relaxed. Faster and more efficient doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to making anyone, but the people making the enormous amounts of money at the top, any happier. \u201dNothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden.\u201dI made 62 highlights reading this book, which is an all-time record for me. I could have had even more! Harari gave me so much to ponder and consider that I\u2019ve already decided that in a few years I\u2019m going to reread the book. I borrowed the book from the library, but I already know I will need to own this one because a book like this needs to be readily available to help me better explain my own thoughts. I could have written a review as long as the book itself because there are so many assertions in this book that cause the mind to expand and make new connections across a myriad of subject matters. It is the most important book I\u2019ve read in a long time. I hope it will be for many of you as well. We are gods on this planet, and we need to change our view of how we see ourselves in the context of the planet and the future. \u201dIs there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don\u2019t know what they want?\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten", "This is a hugely ambitious book; it takes a very broad approach, condensing huge topics into short chapters in an attempt to provide a basis for the development of our entire species. The parts I found most interesting were regarding ecology and man\u2019s interaction with the ecosystem. Human history is that of ecological disaster. Wherever we go, whatever we do, we fuck up the ecosystem and leave our mark of destruction. This is not a new phenomenon, it\u2019s something Sapiens have always done. When we developed our massive brain, we came up with new and creative ways to dominate and control our environments and these were often destructive and to the detriment of all other forms of life. We learnt to survive. We learnt to thrive. But the price was paid with the extinction of many other species.Harari writes that man is so far removed from his natural self. Despite the modern world he lives in, he still has his innate biological drives and instincts (as governed by our genetic makeup) and when these aren\u2019t fulfilled (which they never could be in a metropolis) man becomes depressed and isolated. It\u2019s because we jumped to the top of the food chain and the ecological system was not given time to adjust and neither was man\u2019s biology. These things normally take a millennium, not a few centuries. We still have the same bodies (and instincts) of our ancient kin and it does not meet the environment we live in. This occurred because of three major revolutions in human history. The first was the cognitive revolution which allowed for the creation of language, effectively setting us above all other forms of life in terms of intelligence. The second was the agricultural revolution, which allowed us to harvest the earth and control it to meet our dietary needs. The third was the scientific revolution, which allowed us to take the first steps in understanding life and the universe and use the discoveries to benefit humankind and industry. Harari narrates all these monumental events with much detail, though because of the nature of the book he does fall into generalisations, but I didn't mind too much. There were also quite a few funny comments to offset it:\n\u201cYou could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.\u201d \nAnd through this he also raises many questions. What would have happened if the other species of human had survived? Would we be at harmony? What religions, science and art could the other species of human\u2019s developed had they the opportunity to flourish like we did? These are such interesting questions, and ripe material for a science fiction novel exploring such ideas. I\u2019m sure someone has written one about it somewhere. So this was a great read, full of interesting facts and ideas, with the potential to change how you view the human race and its history. ", "The book was too much a basic primer for me, at least to start with, but that's probably because I've read too many books on our origins biologically and culturally. Once the author had us settled into the civilization of cities he waxed romantically (as authors on this subject quite often do) on the life of the hunter gatherer and its perfection. (I've just finished Sebastian Junger's Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging and there was more of that.) If it was all so perfect then more of us would return to that ancient life style where people had more leisure, freedom and happiness according to Harari and Junger, neither of whom have given up their miserable materialistic lives for stalking around with a spear. The book got better. There were some good explanations of why we are as we are and how things developed, Such as human conversation evolving (see below) so we could gossip about our fellow tribes people. I didn't always agree with the author. But I always enjoy books like that to some extent because it gives me a different point of view, different reasons and things to think about. So this was good. But then it dragged at the end as the author got preachy and scifi technological about our bionic futures. At some time not in the unimaginable future, robots will think for themselves and be able to feel, and then they will supercede us... Yes well Asimov covered all that more than half a century ago. It's not going to happen we are too complex to duplicate. And anyway I can't see robots gossiping and if they don't do that what have they got to talk about (view spoiler)[the weather I suppose, if they were British robots. (hide spoiler)] that will make them 'human'? If the desire to gossip gave us speech, then the inability to gossip puts us right back into the pre-sapiens world. Robots are retrogression. Bionic bodies though, that might be progress._________Written on reading the book. According to the author, basic vocal communication was solved by the primates. And although animals aren't supposed to have theory of mind, green monkeys have been heard calling 'beware there's a lion' when there's no such thing, they just don't want to risk losing or having to share food they've just found.Human conversation apparently evolved so we could gossip. As a social animal, we need to know whose screwing who, who ripped off who, and who lives in a really disgusting midden. Maybe the author's right. He also says that we are not a tolerant species. He got that right for true.", "Chris Evans highly recommended this book. When Captain America says so, you listen.It\u2019s been almost three years since I joined Goodreads and this is literally the second non-fiction book I finished reading. The last time I read a non-fiction book was in December 2016, it was an autobiography titled In Order to Live by Yeonmi Park. Anyone who knows my reading taste should know that I don\u2019t read non-fiction, not only I found the majority of them to be boring, the main reason behind why I read is escapism and the best genre to offer me the best escapism experience lies in SFF. I don\u2019t even know how to rate and review this book because it always made me feels awkward to give a rating to a non-fiction work, especially if it\u2019s an autobiography, which luckily this book is not. Please remember that my rating\u2014as always\u2014speaks mostly for my reading enjoyment, not the technicality of the book.\n\n\u201cNothing captures the biological argument better than the famous New Age slogan: \u2018Happiness begins within.\u2019 Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions \u2013 none of these will bring you happiness. Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.\u201d \n\nSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is exactly what the title claimed to be. Harari did a spectacular job in compressing important moments\u2014which are HUGE\u2014of our history into this book. I\u2019ve heard so many incredible things about it but never gotten around to it because I thought I would be bored with it, this book, however, proves to be incredibly enlightening and engaging than I thought it would be. There are way too many topics of discussion to unpack in a single review for me, Harari elaborated on how humanity became the most powerful race, the insane power in collective belief, money, war, advancements of technology, religions, and many more important topics.\n\n\u201cMoney is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.\u201d \n\nA huge part of why I found this book to be not as factual as I expected. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Harari provided tons of facts and well-researched notes, but the author\u2019s belief and opinion definitely bleeds into the text. This isn\u2019t particularly a problem for me; I found it highly intriguing to read his perspective on humanity and our history. In general, I like to understand why people act or think the way they do about something and Harari explained his reasonings. Obviously, there were some of his opinions that I agree with, some that I don\u2019t. However, I never found the book to be preachy, his combination of knowledge, facts, and opinion made me think about our society these days. Plus, I doubt that this book would\u2019ve been compelling for me to read if it were all pure facts and data.\n\n\u201cHow many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure there are thousands of reviewers more knowledgeable than me that can tell you why this book is incredible. I\u2019ll close this review by saying that if you feel intimidated by this book, I can assure you that Harari\u2019s prose was utterly easy to digest. Sure there were a few topics\u2014like capitalism\u2014that bored me but most of the time I had a fantastic and enlightening time reading this book. Heck, I personally think this book should be available as a must-read book for everyone at school when they\u2019re learning about history. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind made education and information a joy to read. The last pages of the book showed glimpses of Harari\u2019s thoughts about the future of humanity, which I assume is what his book, Homo Deus, will be about and I look forward to reading it, hopefully within this year.\n\n\u201cIs there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don\u2019t know what they want?\u201d \n\nYou can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions", "The only parts of this book that really grabbed my attention were the chapters on early humankind, and especially the interaction between Homo Sapiens and other Homo species. The rest of it is a very pedestrian and basic journey through some aspects of human history, with the author making a lot of sweeping assertions and tending towards a rather vague and disembodied explanation of things like culture, money, etc. These sort of general explanations might be good for someone new to the study of history, but the reader should beware that they don't get taken in too much by the author's often simplistic and one-sided explanation of these concepts. The unifying theme of it being \"a history of humankind\", focusing on Homo Sapiens as a species, often disappears and it becomes a general plod through whatever aspects of history the author is interested in. More on Homo Sapiens' relations with other species and with nature might have been good.", "- Pssst! Eve!- Who's there?- A friend.- What kind of friend? Come on out, don't be shy.- I'm not Shai-- You are. - I'm not. Who told you that?- I just figured it out myself. Oh, there you are. What are you doing curled round that branch?- Waiting for a chance to talk to you, Eve. So tell me, where are you going today?- I'm gathering. See, Adam and me are hunter-gatherers and we take turns. Today he's hunting and I'm gathering. He's going to catch a rabbit, and I'm going to find mushrooms and wild garlic for the delicious rabbit and mushroom casserole we're making for dinner.- It sound exhausting.- It takes about three hours a day. And it's fun. I love it.- I see you already have your mushrooms. So where are you going to gather your garlic?- There's a good place just past that hill. - You know that?- I know every inch of the Garden of Eden like it was the back of my hand.- But tell me, what will you do if you get there and a bear has eaten it? I understand that bears love wild garlic.- They do! They're so naughty. But they're so big and strong and cuddly too, you have to take the whole package. I'll go look somewhere else, I know another good spot.- What if those naughty bears have eaten the garlic there too?- Well, I don't know. - Wouldn't Adam be mad if you got home without any garlic for your favourite dinner?- Of course not. He's crazy about me. I'd just kiss him and he'd forget the whole thing a minute later.- But suppose he was really looking forward to dinner, and he was too hungry to want sex right there and then?- Adam's never that hungry. - But suppose.- Look, I have no idea. What am I supposed to do about it?- Well, you could start a vegetable patch.- What's that?- You take some wild garlic, and all the other things you're especially fond of, and you start growing them in one place. - That won't work. The bears would find out about it and they'd come by one night and eat the lot.- No problem. You make a strong fence around the vegetable patch so they can't get in. - A fence? - You take big logs and drive them into the earth, very close together.- Big enough to keep out bears?- You're starting to get the picture.- And all this trouble just so that I can be sure of having garlic when I need it?- Oh, it's not just garlic! You can grow all sorts of things in your vegetable patch. Wheat for example.- Wheat?- It's a kind of grass. You take the seeds and grind them up and mix them with water and herbs and bake them over a fire. Then you eat it with honey.- I like the honey part, but the rest of it sounds disgusting. Why would anyone want to do that?- Look, it's more efficient. You could grow all your food in your vegetable patch, and then you wouldn't have to spend so much time walking around gathering.- I told you it was just three hours a--- You'd be able to start a larger family. You know how much attention kids need. Wouldn't little Cain and Abel like to have a few baby brothers and sisters?- Well now you mention it, Adam and I have talked about that. But I hate this wheat idea. Burned ground-up seed paste. Yuk.- In fact, bread is quite tasty.- I'm sure it's not good for you just eating seed paste. The Lord Jehovah always tells us to maintain a balanced diet with plenty of fresh greens. Trust me, He knows everything about food and nutrition.- If you tried it, you might find it's better than you think.- And look, if we started this vegetable patch, then we'd need to look after it all the time. We couldn't move around. It's fun being a nomad.- But it wouldn't be so much fun if you had a larger family, would it?- Okay, you have a point there.- See, this vegetable patch is just the start. You think ahead a bit. When Cain and Abel are grown up, they'll start families of their own and move off to the next valley to hunt and gather there. You'll never see your grandchildren. Won't that be sad?- Well, it's true--- You start growing wheat, and there'll be enough for you, and Adam, and Cain and Abel, and all their families too. And you'll be able to play with the grandchildren every day.- But look, if there's, like, fifty of us living in the same place for ages then it'll get filthy. We tried staying put once. Didn't work. After a year, we went back to being nomads.- What's more important, a bit of dirt or seeing your grandchildren?- Uh--- Just think about it unselfishly, Eve. - Okay, okay, I guess the grandchildren. I guess. But look--- Yes?- If we start doing this, then after a while there'll be too many of us for the vegetable patch.- So, some of you will go off and start a new vegetable patch.- But then we'll never see them. We'll be back where we started.- You need to invent some technology, Eve. - What's technology?- You know, things like axes and bow-drills and stuff. But a bit more complicated. You'll be amazed. - I'm not sure it sounds like a good idea. Bow-drills are plenty complicated for me.- Eve, just try it! Don't be so prejudiced. You admitted you were wrong about the vegetable patch.- My head is spinning. Why don't you come back and have dinner with us? See, I found the garlic while we were chatting. I'm sure Adam would love to talk to you. I promise, our rabbit casserole is killer.- What's for dessert?- Dessert?- Eve, there are so many things you need to learn! Here, let me tell you how to make an apple pie...[I also have a serious review of the book here.]", "Rating 5* out of 5. This is one of those rare books which is superbly written, intelligent and mind-altering. I am convinced by this author's arguments and my view of the human condition has changed permanently. I thought this would be a book that would delve lavishly in later human evolution, but it is does not. It discusses it briefly and moves on, concentrating its effort on the times of agricultural revolution and forward. It is a masterpiece of anthropology. \"Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. One the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As times went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as United States and Google.\"\"Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persits, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. [...] Most millionaires sincerely believe in the existence of money and limited liability of companies. Most human-rights activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights.\"I have never considered the extent of the imagined reality we all live in before. I have never equated my belief in human rights with the belief in Vishnu, or considered that a corporation too is all in our collective heads. The author moves on through history and gives plenty of new perspectives on events. \"Most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on the condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions - and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we'll get paradise in return? We've seen it on television.\"These are just a few tidbits of insight and perspective. I absolutely loved this book! Highly recommended to anyone curious about the human condition.", "\"Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don\u2019t know what they want?\" Now, that is a mean cliffhanger on page 466! I am so done with Sapiens, I am willing to enter the realm of posthuman Homo Deus out of spite for my species. During the time it took me to read the \"short\" history of humankind, written in funny sarcastic prose, painting with broad brush strokes what made us develop into this bizarre population of 7 billion people, I have rated this brick of a book five stars, one star, no star, all the fault in our stars. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, though. I am as surprised as I can be that my fingers eventually ended up choosing four of them to head my review. It must mean that my serotonin levels are particularly high today.Let's be honest. There are difficulties in this book. And there's no surprise there, as it is written by a homo sapiens, a species notoriously wellknown for making false assumptions and creating individual and collective fictions to survive, adapt and conquer the world. The author, who specialises in world history according to the oxymoronic blurb (what is his GENERAL field then, I would like to ask?), sells his narrative as a factual account a bit too often for me to enjoy it fully. I felt myself tending towards one star while reading the superficial analysis of empires, for example. I kept asking myself what the preferred audience for this book is, as it is clearly too difficult to read for people who are not interested in history, and too shallow for those who are. I was building up a real emotional rage (my serotonin levels were bad between pages 200-350!).BUT!This books keeps people in my environment talking, discussing, reflecting. And that is a good thing, I believe. As long as homo sapiens tries to acquire more sapientia, the world becomes more serene according to my worldview, aka imagination. I like Harari's premise, that the ability to create collective fictions and use them as guidelines for our shared communities defines us as a species.And part of my irritation derived from the fact that he is excellent at demonstrating the human narrative skill in his book. I felt his story took over, and interferred with mine. I have a different idea of the Agricultural Revolution. So I can get into a rage when reading his? I am confirming his premise by doing so.My annoyance with his easygoing, dismissive style is at the same time what kept me reading - he is like the laughing philosopher who despairs of the world and decides that all is a joke, while I most of the time take the position of the crying philosopher who wants to change humankind for the better. Harari does for homo sapiens what Hitchens did for gods. He puts them in their place. This book has its place in the meaningless, yet amusing narrative of a bunch of mammals whose best and worst skill is storytelling.Be warned, but read it!", "This is an excellent book about the history of humans, covering all aspects; evolution, anthropology, geography, psychology, religion, ideologies, and the future of humans. Physically, the book is beautiful; the glossy paper makes it heavy as well. What really makes the book interesting is the unique points of view that the author, Yuval Harari, brings to life.For example, early in the book, Harari mentions that chimps and sapiens (humans) can only organize in groups of up to 150, without organizing into a hierarchical structure. So, how did cities grow to their enormous size? Through fiction. Yes, that's right, through fiction, through beliefs in common myths. These are myths about ideologies. These imaginary fictions include human rights, nations, and currency; they work because many people cooperatively believe in them.Some civilizations are built quite differently from our own. For example, the Bari Indians believe that genes do not come from a single pair of parents, but that they are contributed by multiple fathers. Monogamous relationships do not exist among their tribes. Harari discusses a number of controversial theories about nuclear families and monogamous relationships. One theory states that infidelities and divorce of modern times stem from forcing people to live in unnatural, permanent relationships. Another theory holds that monogamy and nuclear families are core human behaviors.Harari describes the disappearance of many animal species in certain habitats that are coincidental in time with the arrival of humans. For example, Australia lost 23 of 24 large animal species at about the same time that humans migrated there. Many other islands were also rich in large mammals until humans arrived.Harari discusses the agricultural revolution in some detail. He addresses the question why agriculture became important in the Middle East, Central America, and China, but did not become popular in Australia, Alaska, or South Africa. He explains that most plants and animals cannot be domesticated, and that regions where there is a deficit in domesticatable plants and animals did not develop agriculture.It is obvious that Harari laments the rise of agriculture. He claims that hunter gatherers, who roamed the lands and did not stick to one location like agriculturists, were more stimulated, less in danger of starvation and disease. Their diets were more varied. Agriculture increased the volume of food, but not better quality of food, and did not yield more leisure-time. Agriculture created population explosions and pampered elites. In fact, Harari claims that the agricultural revolution is \"history's biggest fraud.\" The culprits of this fraud were wheat, rice, and potatoes, all plants that domesticated humans! Also, farming encouraged warfare, because it forced people to fight to protect territory. And agriculture, because it developed over millennia (not overnight), created consequences gradually. People could not anticipate the full consequences of their decisions. More wheat helped to lead to more children, and less food for each.Harari compares the Code of Hammurabi with the American Declaration of Independence. Hammurabi's code implicitly acknowledges three classes; superiors, commoners, and slaves. The Declaration of Independence states that all men were created equally. But Harari disputes this; he states that men were not created at all, but instead they evolved differently.From a sociological point of view, Harari asks why are most cities patriarchical. It is not because men are stronger. Physical prowess is inversely proportional to social power in most societies. He explores various theories, but none of them are very compelling.Since the French Revolution, political history is a series of attempts to reconcile liberty--which involves individual freedom--and equality. In order to understand another culture, one should look at the \"Catch 22's\", that is, look where rules and standards contradict each other. These contradictions are part of culture. For example, in Medieval Europe, there was a clash between Christianity and chivalry. In modern Western civilization, there are clashes between equality and liberty.I have just scratched the surface of this big book. I will leave you with one more unique point of view expressed in this book. Harari calls the present modern age the \"Age of Ignorance.\" I won't explain this; it would be a spoiler. This book is a wonderful introduction to sociology, and I highly recommend it to all.", "Fantastic. Absolutely sublime. I don't think I've ever read a book with such grand scope, or a book that promises to cover so much and actually delivers. Dealing with the biggest questions about our species - Why are we here? Why are we the way we are? What does our happiness mean? - Harari writes precisely and with shrewd use of metaphor, providing answers that seem intuitively right but leading us to think further than we have before. The links between giant forces that control our world such as capitalism, science, and empire are made brilliantly and made me see the world through fresh eyes.Dizzyingly good. Everyone should read this.", "\"The ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language...fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.\"-- Yuval Noah Harari , Sapiens The writing style reminds me a bit of Bob Wright's The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology, Mann's 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, or Sagan's Cosmos. It is obviously a book directed at non-academics interested in 'Big History'. If I were to compare Wright's writing for a general audience and Harari's, I'd probably suggest that Harari is a bit more flamboyant in his speculations and inferences (a bit more like Mann). I imagine more than a few academic anthropologists, geneticist, archaeologists would read this book with a need to keep their eyes from rolling back. I'm not saying he's wrong. I seriously don't have enough evidence, or enough background to argue individual points. I'm just saying his flag on this flies pretty high. For entertainment, this book is firmly a 5. For veracity, perhaps a 3?But it is VERY engaging and like Wright, Mann, and Gladwell before him, Harari has capture the imagination of the reading public by taking academic topics and smoothing out the rough edges and making it easier for a general audience to swallow and digest. That is why these pop-academic books keep getting written, they sell WELL. The end of 'Sapiens' jumps ahead to the future of mankind and serves as almost a tease for Harari's next book Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.", "Nothing new! Everything I read in this book to some extent I learned at the anthropology courses taught by academician Balaceanu-Stolnici.Harari is a good writer, but one with a very decided agenda. I had to point out how surprisingly little he seems to have read on quite a number of essential topics. It would be fair to say that whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously. So we should not judge Sapiens as a serious contribution to knowledge but as 'infotainment', a publishing event to titillate its readers by a wild intellectual ride across the landscape of history, dotted with sensational displays of speculation, and ending with blood-curdling predictions about human destiny. By these criteria it is a most successful book.", "\nOne of Otis and Abby's top reads.\n", "Every once in a decade, a book comes along that has the capacity to radically change the way we think about matters of substance. This book is one of them. It asks fundamental questions about our evolution as humans and offers counter intuitive, tangential viewpoints. It tests our thinking, provokes new trains of thought. The book is highly readable and an immense provocation. It must be read, whether or not you are particularly interested in mankind, its history, its evolution or its future. I can't repeat myself often enough. Its an absolute mandatory read. No question about it. A NOTE ON RATING: I rate most good books at 3 stars, meaning it was a good read and was worth the time it took to read. I work on the principle that a good book is par for the course: we are all expected to write good books. If any ingredient is missing, I downgrade it to two stars. This is the only book I have given five stars. I need not say more. Please just read it. ", "Beginner's guide to sociobiology. And since I am a complete beginner, perfect for me.I finished this some six months ago: interesting to see what has remained: gossip, something I hate and rarely indulge in, is an important factor in creating social cohesion, (so perhaps I should revise my attitude to it). True, when you think about it: you and I can only gossip about someone we both know. And it might be important to know who is forming an alliance behind our back. However, as social glue, gossip can only work in smaller groups: once you get past around forty or fifty it becomes unwieldy. Then you need to invent some story that everyone believes in, a story to bind 'us' together, that 'we' are 'we' and 'we' are defined (not 'them', who believe in something 'other'). Exceeding accessible, enjoyable, packed with information. I learned a lot, but then I was starting from absolute zero. ", "A friend of mine at work recommended I read this during the week \u2013 and it is hard not being struck by the odd coincidence of that. Not so much him recommending a book to me, he\u2019s done that before, but this book is very similar to The Patterning Instinct and I only read that a week or so ago. And that\u2019s odd too, since it is years since I\u2019ve read a book on this theme, despite it being a bit of a favourite at one time. So, reading two books on much the same topic, covering lots and lots of the same ground, and in quick succession, recommended by completely different sources all seems strange to me.If you are tossing up whether or not to read this one, I would probably recommend reading The Patterning Instinct instead. Not least because, I think it covers the non-Western philosophies and spiritual traditions it discusses much more on their own terms than this one does. It also covers them in ways that make you feel, even though the Patterning\u2019s author provided merely a thumbnail sketch of each, that it is a sketch of the philosophy itself. This one made me feel I was being presented an \u2018example\u2019 rather than a \u2018sketch\u2019 \u2013 with the history of humans being presented much more as a kind of story that leads to us in the West as the culmination. That is, I came away from tins one thinking of Said\u2019s Orientalism, feeling that this was a white guy explaining other-people\u2019s-cultures \u2013 which might even have been true of the patterning book too, but that one felt more inclusive. I want to say \u2018objective\u2019 but that\u2019s probably not the right word.The patterning book was, even in its title, a bit of a dig at Pinker \u2013 whereas, this one pays him homage repeatedly throughout. And that is interesting here, since we are seeing essentially the same \u2018data\u2019 being used to justify significantly different conclusions in the two books. So, in that sense, I really didn\u2019t come away from reading these two books in quick succession feeling it was a waste of time. I do understand that you might not want to read both of them together \u2013 although, I feel like I\u2019ve read them in the way that an ex-Australian Prime Minister used to collect various conductors\u2019 interpretations of Mahler Symphonies. The benefit of reading both has been that I got to see \u2018evidence\u2019 from the past, even when it is pretty much the exact same evidence, being used to justify significantly different conclusions. Obviously enough, I would recommend the Patterning book because it more closely corresponds with my prejudices \u2013 something that would be hardly surprising, I guess. But that said, I would also recommend it because I think it presents the material in more depth and in ways that are likely to provide you (and maybe even provoke you) with more insight into the complexities of the material too. The author of that one remains clear and accessible, despite the complexities of the material presented \u2013 something this one is too, by the way, it just I didn\u2019t quite feel this one was as comprehensive \u2013 so the clarity here was also a function of the simpler presentation of the material.I found a lot of the last of this to be \u2013 well, a bit too Pinker for my tastes as well. This happened a couple of times throughout \u2013 for instance, there is a bit early on where he discusses males and aggression and their hormones and the genetic selection that encouraged it, and so on \u2013 and since I have just finished reading Fine\u2019s T-Rex book on all this, that section proved a bit of a cringe. The bits at the end where science is proposed as being about to swoop down and save the day (and look, I know I\u2019ve making a bit of a strawman of his argument here, but too not much of a strawman) left me cold, to be honest. My problem with the promise that \u2018human ingenuity will triumph in the end\u2019 is that, well, maybe it will, but betting the house on something that simply can\u2019t be a sure thing seems a little reckless to me. Particularly when all life on earth might be wagered on the other side of the bet. I\u2019m not much of a betting man, so perhaps I\u2019m too cautious. But then, maybe we should be a little more cautious with this kind of gamble, even if we end up laughing at how overly cautious proved to be while we are looking back from the glorious future that is always promised us. It\u2019s just that some scientists believe that if global warming proves to be as bad as they think it is going to be, the total population of people on the planet could end up being about half a billion people \u2013 which means that about 7 billion people will be in excess to requirements and so will have to die one way or another.Bits of this were really very good \u2013 I\u2019m definitely not saying \u2018don\u2019t read this book under any circumstances\u2019 \u2013 not in the least, but if you\u2019ve read neither of these two books and only plan to read one \u2013 read the other one.", "Very well read by Derek Perkins, I highly recommend this book to everyone. Whatever your beliefs, you'll find plenty of food for thought in this relatively brief outline of our history from a middling animal to whatever the hell we are now. It's about 15 hours long, but never dragged a bit. I made excuses to listen every minute that I could & even downloaded the ebook to reread sections for clarification & to ponder a bit more at length. I highly recommend this method. (I'm putting this section first because I wax poetic (read \"long winded\") below.) ---------------------Update 16Dec2018: here is a good piece about Harari's philosophy that should be taken into account when reading his books. I don't agree with it all, but it does contain important points to consider.https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public...---------------------I've listened to several books on evolution lately: Voyage of the Beagle, Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation, & Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors. I would have thought these books sufficient since I have no particular interest in or need for this branch of science, but it was the runner up for the monthly read for the \"Science & Inquiry\" group. It looked interesting & was available in audio, so I took a chance. I'm so glad I did. It goes far beyond those. It's not just biology, anthropology, sociology, politics, or even history, but an examination of us through them all. Harari uses a macro overview of our evolution from the mere biological to the cognitive, agricultural, unification, & scientific revolutions. He then looks at what they really mean to us both as a species & as individuals.Harari's timeline summarizes much of his text nicely. The times below are in years ago.4.5 billion: Formation of planet Earth.3.8 billion: Emergence of organisms. Beginning of biology.6 million: Last common grandmother of humans and chimpanzees.2.5 million: Evolution of the genus Homo in Africa. First stone tools.2 million: Humans spread from Africa to Eurasia. Evolution of different humanspecies.500,000: Neanderthals evolve in Europe and the Middle East.300,000: Daily usage of fire.200,000: Homo sapiens evolves in East Africa. (Update to this. In 2017, 300K year old Homo Sapien fossils were discovered. May not have been confined to East Africa.) 70,000: The Cognitive Revolution. Emergence of fictive language. Beginning of history. Sapiens spread out of Africa.45,000: Sapiens settle Australia. Extinction of Australian megafauna.30,000: Extinction of Neanderthals.16,000: Sapiens settle America. Extinction of American megafauna.13,000: Extinction of Homo floresiensis. Homo sapiens the only surviving human species.12,000: The Agricultural Revolution. Domestication of plants and animals. Permanent settlements.5,000: First kingdoms, script and money. Polytheistic religions.4,250: First empire \u2013 the Akkadian Empire of Sargon.2,500: Invention of coinage \u2013 a universal money. The Persian Empire \u2013 a universal political order \u2018for the benefit of all humans\u2019. Buddhism in India \u2013 a universal truth \u2018to liberate all beings from suffering\u2019.2,000: Han Empire in China. Roman Empire in the Mediterranean. Christianity.1,400: Islam.500: The Scientific Revolution. Humankind admits its ignorance and begins to acquire unprecedented power. Europeans begin to conquer America and the oceans. The entire planet becomes a single historical arena. The rise of capitalism.200: The Industrial Revolution. Family and community are replaced by state and market. Massive extinction of plants and animals.The Present: Humans transcend the boundaries of planet Earth. Nuclear weapons threaten the survival of humankind. Organisms are increasingly shaped by intelligent design rather than natural selection.The Future: Intelligent design becomes the basic principle of life? Homo Sapiens is replaced by superhumans?The human animals were in the middle of the food chain & basically not significant players in evolutionary terms for over 2 million years. Homo Erectus & Neanderthals were around, even tamed fire & used tools. It\u2019s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a straight line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus begetting the Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals evolving into us. This linear model gives the mistaken impression that at any particular moment only one type of human inhabited the earth, and that all earlier species were merely older models of ourselves. The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species. And why not? Today there are many species of foxes, bears and pigs. The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man.The big take away is that we are not exclusive. There are even indications that we interbred both with Neanderthals & at least one other.It wasn't until our cognitive evolution of 70,000 years ago that Homo Sapiens really began to emerge from the other animals & they did so with a vengeance. We wiped out all competition with thoroughness & the paranoia of a Banana Republic dictator. (His comparison & an apt one in relation to his argument.) Megafauna (animals over 100 lbs) die-offs followed our emergence into an environment with regularity all over the globe. It's really interesting how much we have changed the environment for so long. He contends that no human has lived \"naturally\" since our cognitive leap.Evolutionary Success means the more copies of the DNA, the better. This does NOT equate to individual comfort, circumstance, or survival, simply to the overall number of individuals available to reproduce. This perspective is very important in the course of the book. For instance, did we domesticate wheat or did it domesticate us? Wheat went from a scattered grass in one small region of the globe to covering an enormous amount of the globe & it didn't really do any favors for the early average humans that raised it. Overall, their individual lives were probably worse than that of their free ranging contemporaries, but more humans could live in smaller areas - an evolutionary success & the Luxury Trap: What was once a luxury quickly becomes a necessity. His take on our ability to communicate is wonderful. We're not the only species who can lie (monkeys can & do) nor the best at making sounds (parrots are better), but we're the ones that gossip & spin collective fictions (shared myths) that we agree on: money, empires, & religion - the main forces that unify us. Money is a shared myth, an imaginative leap to believing that a particular item of little practical worth was in fact a counter of far reaching consequences. His explanations of the failure of barter, shared favors, & economies are masterful.He gets into the shared structures & ways we dealt with the increasing complexity of life. Where the hunter-gatherer only had to remember where food was, the farmer had to think ahead & deal with supporting more specialized humans - leaders & taxes. That led to writing which started out as accounts & math. His queries & examples on why we primarily have patriarchal societies was interesting, if inconclusive. That's one of the things I like about his writing; he doesn't insist on conclusions, but is OK with describing interesting points to ponder.His macro view of the unification of the globe was excellent. Empires were eventually good things for humanity as a whole, but pretty horrific on those participating in their formation & pure hell on the environment.Religion: While he says Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. he later refines this with the discussion of those that believe natural laws provide the order, not a supernatural being. ...Jainism and Buddhism in India, Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism, Cynicism and Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were characterized by their disregard of gods. Animistic religions had little need to spread the word & those with pantheons often adopted some of the conquered gods, so it wasn't until the rise of monotheism that the real religious trouble started.Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists. A religion that recognizes the legitimacy of other faiths implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition. He further stretches his definition of religion to include shared myths. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise.I've always thought politics & economics were just another form of belief system & he confirms that. He looks into our various empires & how they evolved through history along with the many changes they caused.The Scientific Revolution is plain incredible in the amount of change it has made in the world in such a short time - a mere 500 years. He calls it \"The Discovery of Ignorance\". Where religions pretend to know it all or else dismiss it as unimportant, science admits ignorance & tries to cure it. When coupled with the hunger & resources of empires based on capitalism, it launched us into today - for good or ill - he has plenty of examples of both.He wraps up by asking some hard questions about the future. He doesn't even pretend to know where we might wind up in even a few decades. In fact, he admits that he probably didn't even mention what will seem a likely scenario from hindsight, but he does point out a few of the things that should trouble us. Much of it he ties to the Gilgamesh Project - our search to cure disease & stave off death possibly unto immortality. On the surface, this seems like a noble aim, but it is guaranteed to raise some thorny problems along the way.- We will soon be able to resurrect the Woolly Mammoth from extinction. This seems like a laudable project, but what about resurrecting the Neanderthal or any other species of sapien?- What if a new drug that cures Alzheimer's makes regular people smarter? Should we regulate it? Could we? Considering the success of the current 'War on Drugs', I highly doubt it. What would that do to our society?- The irony of those arguing for 'Intelligent Design' as an alternative to the 'Theory of Evolution' is that intelligent design is actually happening now for the first time ever in our history. We're regularly teaching bacteria to perform new tricks & are actively trying to change the genome of domesticated animals in ways that breeding can't accomplish such as changing pork's Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio. What about doing it to people? When it becomes simple to change a fetus' genetic predilection for high cholesterol, it will probably also be easy to change their sexual orientation or intelligence.- As far as we've advanced in the biological sciences, bionics is coming along as is pure hardware. People are getting more & more artificial body parts. Scientists are seeking to create artificial intelligences as well as create human to machine mind interfaces. What is human?He also asks a great question - are we better off or happier? He spends a chapter on happiness. What is it? While he doesn't really try to answer the question, there is a lot to think about.An interesting quirk of his is to use the feminine rather than masculine pronouns in ambiguous situations.

The book surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology. Harari's work situates its account of human history within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology: he sees biology as setting the limits of possibility for human activity, and sees culture as shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change. Harari surveys the history of humankind from the evolution of archaic human species in the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of Sapiens into four major parts:The Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE, when Sapiens evolved imagination).The Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE, the development of agriculture).The unification of humankind (the gradual consolidation of human political organisations towards one global empire).The Scientific Revolution (c. 1500 CE, the emergence of objective

a ton of \"history of the world\" books, but this was fascinating. Highly recommended. I think the author is incredibly good at explaining and simplifying big concepts. He take on complex things like religion & capitalism and explains them in very simple terms that you likely hadn't thought about before. The history of religion chapter was very interesting. I hadn't thought about the fact that many early religions were animists or polytheists, or dualists. Nor the fact that they all sort of merged into todays concepts: \"monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts.\"There was a fascinating bit on the scientific mindset, and how it was key to Europe taking power. After the scientific revolution, they believed in science and its ability to let man discover new things, make more money, etc. This made them into explorers, whereas many other cultures remained very static. Great example of China having had gunpowder for hundreds of years but not using it for anything other than fireworks, and didn't invent the gun. Reminded me a bit of the Mindset.The chapter on capitalism was fascinating. There line about before its invention that the economy didn't grow, and was \"frozen\" as nobody poured money into new things, so there was no growth. Then the notion of credit was discovered, and as growth started, the combination snowballed. In 1500 the annual per capita production was $550 and today its $8,800 - this is an astounding increase, and all because of the virtuous growth cycle of capitalism: money is invested -> businesses grow -> people make money -> they invest their money. I never thought about the fact that reinvesting profits is a core piece of capitalism, but from this lens it really is. \"The human economy has nevertheless managed to keep on growing throughout the modern era, thanks only to the fact that scientists come up with another discovery or gadget every few years \u2013 such as the continent of America, the internal combustion engine, or genetically engineered sheep.\"What I didn't see coming is how the end of the book was dedicated to human happiness. Fascinating questions to ask if we are happier today than 1,000 or 2,000 years ago. By metrics of death rate, average age of death and general health, we ought to be. But clearly peasants after the agricultural revolution were on average less happy than they were before as hunter-gatherers. And now we live in an always-on internet age, with pressure to continue growing our economy. So are we happier? It is the right question, in my opinion. The book then gave the basics of the happiness framework that I've also read in other places and believe in: that people are happy when they have 3 things: (1) Friends and family that love them (2) Are part of a community that makes them feel like they below (3) have a purpose to their life and feel like they are doing something meaningful. However, the book then adds onto this in another way that I have been learning about but hadn't put together with this: meditation. \"According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices.\"So the moral of the book is basically that we should all meditate a lot, stop worrying, and be happy with what we have.", "A Brief History of the Right QuestionsAt the 16th Century, Peter Bruegel the Elder has painted his Landscape with the Fall of Icarus: a farmer works in the field, ships sail by \u2013 and at the bottom, at the corner, almost invisible, Icarus falls to the sea. The Icarus Myth is remembered for thousands of years; the farmer in the painting had lived and died in anonymity. Why, therefore, had Bruegel painted such a small and marginal Icarus and such a central farmer?\u201cA Brief History of Humankind\u201d by Yuval Noah Harari isn\u2019t a conventional, standard history book. Its points of view are of a surprise also for the scholar reader and the professional historian; they satisfy one's curiosity, they are thought-provoking and they may enrage many readers. It\u2019s not a history text whose content is foreseeable, that fits a certain outlook, and in whose index the reader might find anything he already knows, expects and likes.Through illuminating connections between events and their meanings, and through a spectacular integration of history, paleontology, anthropology and sociology, Harari reviews the key questions dealing with the riddle of our being here: how had Homo Sapiens had developed from a minor zoological species to the position of the ruler of the Earth? Which mental structures and beliefs it had created in order to stabilize and expand its domination? What were these ideas? How were created the ideas which had changed human history? What can one learn about the human nature by reviewing the way it all had happened? The questions Harari asks enlighten the history through an important, fascinating and clarifying perspective \u2013 much more than the routine pile of tyrants, commanders, battles, dates and eras that any regular history book is composed of.Which events influenced most on humanity's fate? Not wars but domestication of plants and animals; not conquests of cities but technical inventions and scientific discoveries; not formulating political coalitions but the invention of ideologies: money, religions, nations. Every change in the perception of the human consciousness, every change in communication, Technology or medicine, any development of the interconnectedness of the ultra-values of the western world \u2013 capitalism, technology, science - had influenced the human fate much more than any conquest of a certain city, a certain battle or an empire's rising and falling. That's why the medical researcher William Harvey is much more important than Genghis Khan; that's why the Penicillin discoverer Ernst Boris Chain has influenced \u2013 and is influencing \u2013 the lives of much more people than Hitler and Stalin has ever influenced, combined; that's why fifty Osama bin Ladens aren't the equal of one Thomas Edison, Humphry Davy or Michael Faraday. That's why the anonymous peasant who had brought a sheaf of wild wheat to his house is much more important than Icarus; and that's why Yuval Noah Harari's book is one of the most important popular history books of the recent years."], "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Science", "Philosophy", "Anthropology"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/18962767-itsur-toldot-ha-enoshut", "avg_ratings": "4.43", "ShelvedNumber": "1799"}

Intense. Deviously fun. Why was it that I skipped this co-author's debut?This writing duo\u2014composed of Sarah Pekkanen and Greer Hendricks\u2014wields some kind of power with their combined words. That elusive  \u201cit\u201d  factor present, allowing readers to succumb all too easily to the manipulation. It\u2019s the very experience I hope for each and every time I pick up a book\u2014realistic or not. Life effortlessly fading into the background as the intensity and promise for something truly twisted takes over\u2014no matter how loud the tv might be, who\u2019s begging for attention, or the myriad of things niggling on your conscience. Believe me, none of those things will matter in the face of this devious page-turner. In fact, at times, coming up for breath might not feel optional. Looking back, there are a few reasons I chose to pass on The Wife Between Us. Number one being the hordes of hype. The overwhelming availability, constant marketing and utter feed domination turned me off. Bottom line, hype leads to grandiose expectations, which typically leads to disappointment. Something I\u2019ve become all too familiar with in the literary world as of late. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s bound to be an exhaustive campaign here as well; getting in front of that the only way I was able to keep my expectations at a manageable level. With that said, in my humble opinion, An Anonymous Girl deserves any and all of the hype that\u2019s put out there. If this book is any indication of the sheer cleverness involved in The Wife Between Us, count me in. Sarah Pekkanen and Greer Hendricks introduce readers to Jessica\u2014or Jess\u2014just another anonymous girl working in New York as a freelance makeup artist. Eager to earn some extra cash, Jess manages to finagle her way into a psychological study she overhears one of her clients bailing on. Referred to as Subject 52, Jess is asked to answer a serious of moral and ethical questions honestly, via a lone laptop in a barren classroom. \nI'm not used to expressing myself like this. Writing about hidden thoughts is like washing off makeup and seeing a bare face.\nMuch like Jessica\u2019s theories surrounding the study, this book is nothing like what I had envisioned going in. This is so much more than just another anonymous title, floating around faceless in what\u2019s become a saturated genre. Addictive, original, gasp-inducing, An Anonymous Girl meets all of the requirements necessary to be tagged as a memorable suspense read.*Thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing a copy in exchange for my honest review.", "You ever reading a book and thinking, \u201cwhy was this so expensive? I\u2019m not even having a good time\u201d? Me, the whole time reading this.", "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...  I really enjoyed Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen\u2019s previous novel \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d. So as soon as I saw the cover for this novel and read the synopsis, I knew I just had to read it.  I devoured this novel in just a few hours, ignoring everything and everyone as I read.   The book opens as twenty-eight-year-old makeup artist; Jessica Farris is heading to her last appointment of the day. She travels to her clients instead of them coming to her. Even though she doesn\u2019t always know who will answer the door, Jessica doesn\u2019t fear strangers. She\u2019s learned that \u201cmore harm can come from familiar faces\u201d.  Jessica enjoys what she does. Her appointment is with two young women who are going out to a club that evening. As she applies their makeup, she loses herself in her work, barely hearing the women chatting to each other. But then she overhears a voicemail message one of the women plays\u2026 \n\u201cThis is Ben Quick, Dr. Shields\u2019s assistant.

So when she hears that her client likely won\u2019t be attending, she decides to go in her place\u2026She\u2019s accepted into the study and will be bound by a confidentiality agreement. Jessica is told there are no right or wrong answers, she just needs to be completely open and honest. The questions are personal and may trigger very emotional responses\u2026.\n\u201cCould you tell a lie without feeling guilt?\u201d\nBut Jessica surprises herself and the doctor when she doesn\u2019t shy away from the questions. When the sessions are complete, the doctor asks if Jessica would consider expanding her participation in the study. It would mean more would be asked of her\u2026.\nSIGNIFICANTLY MORE. \nIt would also mean more money.Jessica really opens up to the doctor. She talks about the pressure she\u2019s under and the secret she\u2019s kept for so many years. \n\u201cGuilt is always the heaviest thing I carry\u201d. \nWith Dr. Shields, she\u2019s able to reveal things she\u2019s never talked about before.But as the project expands, Jessica starts to wonder what the doctor is doing with all of the information collected. What will the doctor do with Jessica\u2019s innermost thoughts? Her confessions? Her mistakes? Then the assignments take a strange and unexpected turn. Is she just being paranoid or is something sinister going on?\u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d was a thought-provoking and phenomenal read. It pulled me in from the beginning and wouldn't let go. The chapters are a nice length and alternate between Jessica and the doctor's point of view.In my opinion, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen knocked this one out of the park. This was a fascinating psychological suspense novel with a great storyline, excellent characters, and twists and turns that kept me flipping pages at a rapid pace.A wonderfully dark and suspenseful novel about love, anger, betrayal, morality, and obsession.

Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. Call for more details. Ok, so you know how every year there are books that come out of the gate hyped up? I'm talking a full calendar year before publication, these books are already being shoved in our faces and by the time they come out we are underwhelmed and sick to our stomachs of seeing said book floating around social media to the point we scream and rip out our hair? Don't worry, this isn't one of those. That's not to say we won't see it floating around prominently for the next six months, simply that it is in fact worthy of every bit of hype it's already receiving. In all honesty, I was a bit nervous picking up the sophomore novel following readers' beloved The Wife Between Us, simply due to the high bar that was set with this author duo's debut. In my humble opinion, An Anonymous Girl was even better than TWBU, and I mean that as the highest compliment that I can give!We all have reasons for our actions. Even if we hide the reason from those who think they know us best. Even if the reasons are so deeply buried we can't recognize them ourselves.This is one you need to go into the plot blind folks. Where The Wife Between Us is known for that massive twist (you know the one I'm talking about), An Anonymous Girl slams you over and over again. It's not comprised of a single, WTF twist; this one hits you time and again with OMG-Oh-No-She-Didn't whiplash. Every time I thought I had this one figured out, it turns out I had misjudged and things kept changing. It was the type of complex, thrilling novel of suspense that I have't come across in quite awhile. It's getting harder as an avid reader of mysteries to find ones that I can't figure out immediately, and this one proved to me that there ARE still new tricks and writing techniques that can be used to fool readers while keeping them engaged with the characters. And talk about some wicked nasty characters... My favorite!I'm going to shut up now and let you decide if this is a book you're interested in, but just know that I enjoyed it so much that I'm contemplating re-reading it before publication date just to see if I can catch any of the clues that I missed the first go around; it was that good. I even bumped my initial 4 star rating up to a banging 5 because I can't stop thinking about this book. If you are able to get your hands on an early copy, don't put it off until publication date. If you are the type to pre-order, PRE-ORDER THIS BABY. Seriously, it's such a fun read with a sly and delicious cover; your bookshelf will thank you! Your family, your boss, and your to-do list however will not; they'll be sorely disappointed that you stayed up until the wee hours of the morning binging this juicy drama.

Deceptive, creepy, and unsettling.CW: sexual assault, suicide, deathI devoured An Anonymous Girl. This book was so easy to engage with. I really enjoyed that the book is actually told in two perspectives; One in first person, one in second. This element really added to the creepy factor of the novel, as it\u2019s almost disturbing to think of someone\u2019s internal monologue constantly being geared towards the actions and thoughts of another character without their knowledge. I would totally recommend the audiobook for this reason as the voice actors did a fantastic job.One issue I took with the novel is the theme of morality and ethics was too oversaturated. I had a similar issue with Riley Sager\u2019s The Last Time I Lied with the theme of lies. I can\u2019t stand it when a book is shoving a certain subject matter at me from all angles and does not allow me to pick up the subtext myself. The way morals decisions are integrated into the storyline was obvious and clever enough until the characters constantly started referring to the topic in plain conversation. It was repetitive and tiresome. I think the book would have benefited from more subtlety.Additionally, I felt Jessica was too skeptical as a character. She\u2019s not particularly clever or smart, but is constantly questioning the motives and truth of EVERYTHING without any sufficient reason to in the beginning. It created a real contrast between how Jessica prepared herself for conflict and how she attempted to actually resolve it. It seemed as if the authors were insecure about the audience\u2019s inquisitive abilities and spoon-fed readers questions to consider before they could form them themselves. This is another huge pet-peeve of mine and I likely would have enjoyed the book more if I spent less time questioning the authenticity of Jessica\u2019s thought process.Finally, An Anonymous Girl is not the most shocking, horrifying novel I have ever read. It\u2019s pretty light on gore and violence, which I feel makes it a great choice for those who want to read thrillers without being scared or grossed out. The twists were sometimes clever, but mostly unsurprising when not expected. I would have liked more shock factor, but the charm of this story is more the overall ambience of the novel. The disconcerting vibe that follows you from beginning to end. It was not the most unbelievable mystery I\u2019ve ever read, but it was twisted, unsettling, and unique. Would definitely recommend!!", "My first completed book of 2019 and I loved it!An Anonymous Girl follows two main perspectives:A single girl, in her late-20s, Jessica resides in NYC and works as a freelance make-up artist. She lives a fairly solitary life with a sweet little dog and a couple of close friends, but most of the time, she's alone. Haunted by her past and struggling with residual guilt, she finds it painful to be in contact her family. Her guilt becomes overwhelming when her parents find themselves unexpectedly in extreme financial distress.Dr. Lydia Shields is a wealthy and successful psychiatrist, as well as author, who works at a local college teaching seminars and performing research studies. Her main area of interest is the study of morality. Dr. Shields perspective is written in a second person narrative which I did find jarring at first, but eventually became used to and even enjoyed.Jessica and Dr. Shields become acquainted when Jessica lies her way into participating in one of Dr. Shields psychological studies. At first motivated exclusively by money, Jessica eventually finds herself drawn deeper and deeper into the doctor's web.The relationship lines are extremely blurry. I was so confused as to who was the predator and who was the prey. They both seemed so enamored with one another; it's not healthy.To add to the complication we get Dr. Shields husband, Thomas, thrown into the mix. Again, is he good or is he bad?Everyone in this book is just too damn smart for their own good! Manipulation FACTOR 10!!!The story is extremely fast-paced, with a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs....Someone pass the dramamine!There was mystery, an investigation and a spectacular game of cat-and-mouse. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! In my opinion, this could definitely be one of the top Adult Thrillers I read in 2019. I know it is early but I have pretty much lost my mind over this book.Thank you so much to the publisher, St. Martin's Press, for kindly providing me with a e-copy to read and review.

The rules are simple: Be open and truthful, and avoid pivoting away from any embarrassment or pain the questions provoke. Soon Jess finds herself divulging her deepest secrets via questions posed on a computer screen. Dr. Lydia Shields, the psychiatrist conducting the study is equally drawn in by Jess' responses to her questions. At the end of her two sessions, Jess is invited to expand her participation in the study for higher compensation but at what cost?What ensues, told in alternating POV chapters between Dr. Shields and Jess was a fast-paced, twisty, scheme filled story that you simply won't be able to get enough of.

Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.\"The plot for this story is incredibly original and is what initially piqued my interest in this book. But that's where it ends for me. I already know that I'll be in the minority with my opinions as this book will no doubt appeal to the masses.Told in two points of view, that of Dr Shields, the alluring, manipulative therapist conducting a survey on ethics and morality, and Jess, the unlucky participant that has drawn the attention of Dr Shields. Dr Shields finds Jess is most suitable for a personal agenda and begins the process of grooming and manipulating her. Its clear that the chapters narrated by Dr Shields are meant to have a creepy feel but the atmosphere falls flat. Jess is likeable enough, devastatingly flawed and a victim of her own secrets.I'm all for a slow burn but this book burns so slow it extinguished itself by the 40% mark and never really becomes engaging throughout. The synopsis for this book paints a picture of a story more psychologically frightening than is actually between the pages. The story is totally implausible, which I could forgive if only the narrative had been told in a more captivating way. There are no twists in this book, no gasping moments, no real sense of mystery. The ending is just blah and completely farfetched. I found the story to be pretty lackluster throughout.I would be remiss in not mentioning that clearly the authors are fans of fashion because nearly every scene includes a detailed description of what the characters are wearing down to the tiniest of details. These details lend nothing to the storyline and become laughable at points because of the absurdity of their inclusion in the book. I'm giving this one 2.5 \u2b50 rounded up for plot originality and the fact that I was able to finish the book despite it's failings.I was provided an ARC of this book by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.", "Wow! Five big stars. For once, the hype and buzz are deserved. Remember the rules: Be open and truthful, and avoid pivoting away from any embarrassment or pain these questions provoke.This book grabbed me from the get go. A twenty eight year old woman sneaks herself into an ethics and morality study in order to earn some extra income. I was able to immediately put myself in her shoes. The initial questions had me wondering how I would answer. The chapters alternate between the woman and the doctor heading up the study. It quickly becomes a fast paced ride. Definitely entertaining. There are some real twists so that the tension keeps getting ratcheted up. It\u2019s a hard book to put down. I can even see this being made into a movie. Don\u2019t look for believability here. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some interesting concepts being explored. Power. Trust. Jessica is such a well thought out character. Out of her depth, but a real fighter. No dummy, but she\u2019s up against a master. I was entranced trying to figure out how she would extract herself from this game of cat and mouse. I would love to know how Hendricks and Pekkanen write together because the finished product is seamless.

The subject of the study or the doctor who is playing much more than a game. That\u2019s all I am going to say about the plot. It\u2019s best to go into this blind.I didn\u2019t love The Wife Between Us due to the number of twists and some other elements. I decided to go into An Anonymous Girl with an open mind. I knew this was going to be over-the-top, but I decided to suspend my disbelief over the plot. Once I did, I had a lot of fun reading this. The narrative alternates between doctor and patient. I found the former to be cartoonish, but the latter was intriguing.This is a fast-paced, entertaining read that requires one to suspend disbelief. There might have been a few times where I was laughing out loud at moments that probably were not meant to be funny, but I found them so. With that being said, the plot is original and engaging. There were a few threads that felt incomplete and I was left with some questions. However, in spite of these moments, the entertainment factor won out in the end.

I loved the book The Wife Between Us.Discover the next blockbuster novel of suspense, and get ready for the read of your life.I can not say that I was hooked straight from the very beginning. This one has a slow burn going into it. Once I got into it though I couldn't put it down. It was like a rollercoaster ride filled with twists and turns. I found this psychological thriller to be very addicting once I got to the suspense. The chapters are very short, so it is a fast paced read. This book is very well written. I loved the dialogue, and the writing style. The characters were so well developed. This one kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me intrigued to find out what was going to happen next. This was an unpredictable read for me. It was so surprising. I could not put it down and kept wondering what was going to happen next. The book ended very well. It kept my attention and amazed me.

In my opinion, they copped out with the cheapest of literary devices in a way completely unfair to the reader.Then I started reading reviews for The Anonymous Girl and a lot of people said that they too weren't fans of the first book but found this one to be better. So in a moment of irrational thinking, I purchased their second effort.Like the first, the story was intriguing enough but these guys just don't know how to finish well and I am every kind of done with their books, so done I need a new word for done.", "5 mind blowing stars! \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f Did you ever have a book you saved, even though you got a copy really, really early, because you knew it would be good? I didn\u2019t want An Anonymous Girl to be over long before I ever started reading it. The year-long wait until another book from this dynamite duo feels longer than a year! That\u2019s a great thing in this case; these two authors are perfection together. The Wife Between Us by these Hendricks and Pekkanen is my favorite thriller of 2018, and An Anonymous Girl is already vying for top position for 2019! Sarah Pekkanen and Greer Hendricks have topped themselves with this smashing effort. Wow! It\u2019s written how all thrillers should be, with page-turning, effortless writing, and characters that keep you on your toes. A villain like no other. A fallible but relatable victim. This book is remarkable.

She finds herself participating in a paid psychological study on ethics\u2026But from the start, something doesn\u2019t feel right with it\u2026But then again, Jess needs the money. The study keeps going, becoming more invasive, and eventually Jess begins interacting directly with the psychiatrist in charge of the study, Dr. Shields. Jess develops a strong amount of paranoia early on, which never wanes though she doubts herself, again, because money is an issue. An Anonymous Girl is a story of obsession, right versus wrong, and betrayal. There are creepy characters that will make your skin crawl, a character you may champion (I know I did), and a few characters in the middle that you just can\u2019t figure out. The chapters are the perfect length. The writing flows perfectly in a race to the finish of the book, and the tension builds at a nice pace. I was hooked very early, and I never lost my connection to this book. The storyline is massively original, full of twists and turns, and I will never forget this dark tale of suspense, deviousness, and questioning morality.

I will have my full review up in January on pub day, but until then, I have to say, The Wife Between Us by these authors is my favorite thriller of 2018, and An Anonymous Girl is already at the top of my list for 2019!", "4 stars! A gripping and thrilling page-turner!Struggling to make her rent payments, Jessica Farris, finds herself involved in a well-paying psychology study revolving around ethics and morality. The compensation is too good to pass up. Upon attending the first study meeting and completing the initial questionnaire, Jess is offered the opportunity to proceed further into the depths of the examination with the mysterious Dr. Shields. Tension builds as Jess begins to feel paranoia and anxiety about her involvement and she begins to question what Dr. Shields objectives truly are.This was extremely well written! I was glued to these pages, devouring every single word with curious and hungry eyes. The pace, flow and narration were excellent! Told in alternating chapters between Jess and Dr. Shields, I felt the urge to read \u2018just one more chapter\u2019 from start to finish \u2013 I simply couldn\u2019t get enough of this unique and mysterious story. The characters were well developed and each one kept me curious as to their true intentions throughout the novel. After the intensity of the storyline build up, the ending was a bit of a let-down for me. It didn\u2019t fit with the excellence of the rest of the book, which took away one star.

An Anonymous Girl is available now!", "Another entry in the \"Books with 'Girl' in the title\" series. These books are usually hit or miss for me. Luckily, An Anonymous Girl was closer to the hit side of things.I thought the book took a creative approach to its twisty mystery. As these books are becoming so commonplace, it is becoming easier to predict the shocks. And, even if there is still a bit of a surprise, it can be easy to say,\"Ho hum, that twist was like . . . .\". With this book, however - and I will avoid saying too much so as not to spoil - the major outcomes had a bit of freshness to them.Frequently when reviewing books of this genre I have a problem with the characters. Perhaps they are too over the top or unlikeable (and not in a good and interesting way). In this book, unlikeable or not, the characters were interesting and well balanced. Interactions were, more often than not, high intensity with me on the edge of my seat. Bravo to the characters!I think my only complaint would be that by the end some of the plot points started getting repetitive. I kept asking myself,\"didn't we cover this already?\" It wasn't so bad that it ruined the story, but I did want the author to get on with it a few times.Summary: You like books with \"Girl\" in the title? Definitely read this!", "4 Stars.Completely Intriguing and Totally Unexpected! Jessica is a makeup artist in New York City.

As a part of the study, questions are posed at a computer terminal: \u201cCould you tell a lie without feeling guilt?\u201d; \u201cDescribe a time in your life when you cheated?\u201d Her answer are such that little does she know, at the end of the two sessions, she is the only subject left. Her answers are intriguing and unsettling. Dr. Shields, who is in charge of the study sees something in Jessica and hopes that she will not fail in her role... her doing so would be less than ideal. For both of them.\u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d is book that took me by complete surprise - the premise was a breath of fresh air - it was unexpected and honestly it made me feel, well, dirty, slimey and scared, if I\u2019m telling you the whole truth and nothing but the truth (ha ha, get it, I mean this book is about morality and ethics, right?!). It gets under your skin and makes you wonder how you would answer the questions posed and makes you fearful, terrified even, when you realize what Dr. Shields has in mind for Subject 52 (and no, I\u2019m not going there, in case you were hoping I\u2019d give you a clue!). This is a fast-paced crazy novel whose twists and turns made for a heart stopping novel. I highly recommend it for mystery / suspense lovers. It\u2019ll keep you on your toes for sure.

Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. Call for more details.Jess is a makeup artist who came to New York dreaming of a career in the theater. She has a lot of secrets she's kept hidden, which has led her to become totally self-reliant, although money is one of the biggest sources of anxiety she has to deal with. When she overhears a client thinking about not showing up for a research study she was supposed to participate in\u2014and it pays $500\u2014Jess decides there's nothing wrong with pretending to fill in for the young woman, since $500 would really help with this month's rent.Jess figures all she'll need to do is answer some questions, collect her money, and leave. She wasn't expecting the questions to be difficult, like Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt? Describe a time in your life when you cheated, or Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about? But more than that, she wasn't expecting the psychiatrist conducting the study\u2014whom she never met\u2014to give feedback on her answers, and encourage her to be more honest and more in-depth.As the sessions continue, and the payoff increases, Jess can't help but wonder what the study really is all about. While she is utterly unsettled when the psychiatrist, whom she finds out is the renowned Dr. Lydia Shields, asks whether Jess would be willing to expand her participation in the study. But when Jess learns that the compensation would be significantly higher, there's no way she can turn Dr. Shields' request down.Expanding her participation in the study is definitely not what she expected. Dr. Shields starts to tell Jess where to go, how to dress, and whom to meet\u2014and in some cases, that entails striking up a conversation with a specific man. Jess begins feeling uncomfortable, and wonders exactly what Dr. Shields wants to accomplish. More and more, she questions whether she can trust the doctor\u2014and then Jess discovers a disturbing coincidence that she needs to hide from her, or the doctor could destroy her life.\nAn Anonymous Girl\n is a pretty wild book, full of twists and turns. You wonder how you might react in the same situation, but at the same time I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at times that Jess could be so clueless. There were definitely some surprises thrown in, but ultimately I had my ideas about how the plot would unfold. I just kept hoping that things wouldn't go completely awry, and I was pleased they didn't.Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen, whose last book, \nThe Wife Between Us\n, contained some shockers but didn't quite click for me, definitely kicked it up with \nAn Anonymous Girl\n. I didn't love some of the characters (and I wondered whether some of this stuff could and does really happen) but the pacing of the book was terrific, and I was hooked from start to finish. I was also glad that the twists they threw in fit with the plot rather than just be included to confuse and shock.I know this book will be everywhere when it's released in January, because it's the type of book you can't put down, and it definitely will keep you wondering what comes next. Hendricks and Pekkanen mesh well together, and I can't wait for their next book.NetGalley and St. Martin's Press provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

They had a break-out sensation hit with \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d, last year in 2017. \u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d, will be released in January, 2019. Greer and Sarah are an exciting team. There is something very appealing about two skillful stunning women holding us captive - as awed spectators -waiting to see who we can trust - who to believe- who\u2019s the stalker -and who\u2019s the prey. In \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d, we never knew the complete truth until the end. New secrets were revealed...and we were still wondering who was manipulating who up to the final chapter. In \u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d, once again - if you are sure you know what\u2019s happening in a scene, think again. There are many layers to peel back as we turn the pages. I purposely slowed down my reading. I had no interest to race through this book. I thoroughly enjoyed thinking about issues and questions presented. Like panning for gold.... when searching for INTELLIGENT- PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERS .....( cream of the crops) ..... \u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d, synonymous with Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen, and \u201cThe Wife Between Us\u201d, ......these two books make the cut!!! ....... \u201cAn Anonymous Girl\u201d............\u201dEthics and Morality\u201d is a \u2018hot topic\u2019. It\u2019s at least worthy of a few lifetime discussions. I found it exciting and refreshing to center a psychological suspense novel around a study of this inquiry. .....The first few chapters ARE SERIOUSLY PAGE TURNERS!!! We follow the set-up story between Dr. Shields, adjunct professor at NYU, psychiatrist, and Jessica Farris, 28 year old makeup artist. Jessica works for a company called \u2018BeautyBuzz. She goes to clients homes and gives them a makeover for events like Proms, Bar Mitzvahs, birthdays, and anniversaries. ( she misses working in Theater). Jessica lives alone with her dog Leo. We get back story about Jessica\u2019s parents and younger sister Becky. Becky is a few years younger than Jessica, but lives with her parents and requires special needs. Jessica becomes a paid participant in the study on Ethics and Morality. Right off the bat, Jessica lied her way into the study. Jessica- *Subject 52*, agreed to be bound by confidentiality. She wasn\u2019t allowed to discuss what she was doing with \u2018anybody\u2019. While answering questions that pop up - one at a time - on a computer screen - we can imagine sitting in a private room - in a sterile setting ( in Jessica\u2019s chair), wanting to shy away from feelings of vulnerability- but Jessica is asked to surrender to the process completely- answer the questions honestly- for the process to be successful. We sense Jessica wants to put her entire heart into the study. Even when uncomfortable- we sense she wants to please Dr. Sheild\u2019s. Dr. Sheild\u2019s notices. A trust begins to grow. The Rules are simple and clear. \u201cBe truthful - avoid pivoting away from embarrassment or pain that the questions provoke\u201d. Intimacy begins to grow between Jessica and Dr. Shields. Proper boundaries are questionable. The questions - themselves - in the study were intriguing: \u201cCould you tell a lie without feeling guilt?\u201d, \u201cDescribe a time in your life when you cheated?\u201d......AND MANY MORE......Over weeks- Jessica will be digging deeper - going beyond the superficial....EVENTUALLY......The original study falls off an honorable grid. Dr. Shields prepares an unorthodox experiment. Jessica Farris, becomes a pawn for Dr. Shields own purposes. .....It wasn\u2019t until about half way into this novel - or a little more- when I felt a genuine thriller edge elevate. I ENJOYED BOTH HALVES OF THIS NOVEL.....yet - we feel a change. As Jessica\u2019s anxiety grows into anger \u2014I started noticing more tension building in my own physical body.....( YET WITH GREAT RESPECT & DIGNITY FROM OUR AUTHORS- THERE ARE NO GRAPHIC DISTURBING SCENES).....I really love these women authors!!!! THEY ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I HOPE TO SEE MORE OF when writing novels in this genre. I started thinking about those one or two times when my entire life changed in less than 5 minutes. If we are honest - each of us have moments like this. Jessica did too.  \u201cOnly six weeks ago, Jessica worried about how she would pay for her sister, Becky\u2019s occupational therapy and hoping her makeup business with BeautyBuzz would align so she wouldn\u2019t have to lug her makeup case too far. Her life was quiet, her problems ordinary. Then came an impulsive moment - all of 10 seconds that changed her life\u201d. A simple innocent - cheating lie - changed the course of her life.Jessica isn\u2019t the only person in this story who cheated - and lied .....But \u2018who\u2019 is most dangerous? ALL the characters are memorable- supporting ones too. You\u2019ll meet many more. I haven\u2019t SPOILED ANYTHING! Disasters and consequences - warnings \u2014 who\u2019s in control - doubts - how do you know if you can really trust someone - the tone of a text message - are thoughts to chew on.  \u201cEvery family generates it\u2019s own particular dysfunction. Many people believe that once they cross the threshold into adulthood, legacy can be shed. But the maladjusted dynamics that have been imprinted upon us, often since childhood are tenacious\u201d.", "Having really enjoyed reading The Wife Between Us by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen, their talent is confirmed here with this hugely intense, compelling and addictive An Anonymous Girl, which moves in a rather different direction. This is a story set in New York City, of deception, betrayal, obsession, jealousy, where we are given two different protagonists, the naive and vulnerable 28 year old Jessica Farris and the clinical and detached psychiatrist Dr Lydia Shields, an academic at NYU. Jessica is a freelance make up artist who visits her clients at home, she is struggling financially, not to mention she has a younger sister, Becky, with special needs that require financial support for the help she needs. When she sees the opportunity to get on to a research study that pays, she has no compunctions about lying her way on to it, despite the irony of the topic. It is seeking women between the ages of 18-32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality with anonymity guaranteed.Subject to a confidentiality agreement, Jessica, as subject 52, embarks on the study at Hunter Hall, answering demanding personal questions on a computer screen, guided to be truthful. After the sessions, Jessica is asked to get further involved for further lucrative financial rewards. Jessica trusts Dr Shields with her secrets and has no problem with continuing with the study. However, Jessica's new assignments are out of the classroom and venturing into strange and disturbing territory. Jessica's paranoia levels begin to rise as she finds herself in the hands of a controlling Lydia, who has a estranged husband, Thomas, and is operating from her own hidden agenda. The slow reveals in this twisted, character driven and fast paced story of secrets and lies are expertly done by the authors. This is a wonderfully thought provoking read, it will have you pondering over the moral and ethical dilemmas posed within it with its great character studies. This novel with its unreliable narrators is a salutary lesson for all of us in not blindingly trusting any professional, not everyone is worthy of trust. A brilliantly entertaining and creepy read from authors that are establishing themselves as must read storytellers. Many thanks to Panmacmillan for an ARC.", "Ooh! So addictive!

Navigating through the raging waters of life leaves many a shipwreck in the aftermath.Jessica Farris knows this first hand. She's a twenty-eight year old makeup artist still trying to find her niche in New York City. She struggles to pay the rent on her studio apartment and her bookings from BuzzBeauty are hit or miss. Finding extra money to send home to her parents and special needs sister is coming up short each month.While at one of her beauty sessions, Jess overhears one of the girls regreting an early Saturday morning appointment with a university professor, Dr. Lydia Shields, who is running a volunteer lab on ethics and morality. The first pay-out is $500. A no brainer and Jess shows up in her place. Our girl is in the door. Alone in a room, Jess hovers over the computer screen answering questions about being untruthful in life. The questions begin simply and then escalate in intensity. Certain scenarios are set up and Jess must answer either honestly or how she assumes the good doctor expects.As the pay checks roll in, Jess sinks deeper and deeper into Dr. Shields' world. She is called upon to complete tasks outside of the lab. And here is where Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen excel. The motivating factors are laid out with the reader in mind. We ask ourselves just how far and how deep would we get involved here? What motivates us in our own lives to make the moral choices that we do? Is there ever a line drawn and set in concrete or is it a moveable barrier depending on odd circumstances? Is bartering an option?The main character of Jess is a winner with the writing reflecting her dilemmas in decision-making opportunities. Peeling back the layers of Dr. Shields and others will keep you glued to this storyline. I have to leave it here, folks. You've got to crack this one open for yourselves.

I can\u2019t say much because you\u2019ll have to learn more about the enigmatic Dr. Shields as you read, but suffice it to say I considered from the very beginning whether I should call the IRB on Dr. Shields! Is this research IRB approved??? I need to see the signed approval letter, Dr. Shields!But jokes about research ethics aside, the premise of this study is so interesting. I\u2019m not going to talk even a moment about where the study heads, but in the opening when we see Jessica answering the survey on the computer\u2014I couldn\u2019t look away! The questions are fascinating, as is the research protocol. But the real thrill I had was in reading Jessica\u2019s thought process as she answered the questions. What was Jessica willing to divulge? And how did she reason through her journey of self-discovery? You\u2019ll have to read the book to find out!And then\u2014and I promise I\u2019m keeping this entire review spoiler free\u2014there are some truly amazing characters in this book aside from Dr. Shields and Jessica. From the two girls whose make up Jessica is crafting in chapter 1, straight to the end of the book. I won\u2019t even name these characters because I truly believe that every reader should experience this book themselves without any pre-conceived idea of who is and isn\u2019t relevant to the story. But if you\u2019ve read it or once you do, I hope you reflect back on the outstanding cast of characters that Hendricks and Pekkanen created in this book. I\u2019m positively itching to read An Anonymous Girl again, and savor each of those small moments and characters that comprise this wonderful story. I\u2019ll say that despite this being a longer book, there is not a single scene, plotline, or character that is a throwaway. Every single moment is expertly plotted and woven together, into what I\u2019ll be the first to say is one of the best thrillers I\u2019ve read. I hope you are able to cancel all plans when you pick this one up!!!", "I didn\u2019t care for The Wife Between Us it was too over the top for me but given the hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 about An Anonymous Girl I decided to give it a go. I did, in fact, like this much more than the authors\u2019 previous novel but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019ve read this before. Finally, I decided that my sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu had to do with the power psychologists and psychiatrists wield over those held in their thrall which surfaces frequently in thrillers. The interesting part of this thriller is that the study in which the main character, Jessica, becomes enmeshed is about ethical behavior and morality. What is right? What is wrong? Or, more importantly in this novel, who is right and who is wrong. This is a quick read that is contorted, confounding and electrifying.", "Riveting, absolutely unputdownable & totally mind-blowing stuff!This was an absolutely fantastic psychological thriller novel that I devoured in less than 24 hrs. This books unique storyline immediately drew me in and had me on the edge of my seat for the entirety of reading this book. The pacing and short chapters made this an extremely fast read. AN ANONYMOUS GIRL by GREER HENDRICKS AND SARAH PEKKANEN is a compelling, thrilling, twisted, and rapid-paced read that was so darn entertaining and exciting to read. The intensity level of this novel was so high that my thoughts and feelings never wavered once while reading this book. GREER HENDRICKS and SARAH PEKKANEN delivers quite the fascinating, intriguing, suspenseful and well-written read here with great characters, a unique premise and an extremely enthralling storyline. There was this deep suspenseful undertone to this novel that gets more exciting, intriguing and intense as the novel progressed. I absolutely loved the way that this story was told and thoroughly enjoyed both perspectives equally. The cat and mouse game between our main characters was probably one of the most unnerving that I have ever read which made it all the more exciting. Seeking women ages 18\u201332 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. The psychology study was one of the most clever, intriguing and entertaining hook that I have yet read and I applaud the authors for immediately absorbing me in this storyline and making this another all consuming read for me.Publishing Date: January 8, 2019Norma\u2019s Stats:Cover: Eye-catching, intriguing, alluring, and ominous.

As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, \u201cOnce that first stack got going, it was \u2018Goodbye, Charlie.\u2019\u201d The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library\u2014and if so, who?Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present\u2014from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as \u201cThe Human Encyclopedia\u201d who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orlean\u2019s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books\u2014and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist\u2019s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524238338l/39507318.jpg", "title": "The Library Book", "authors": "Susan Orlean", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39507318-the-library-book", "reviews": ["\n*chef's kiss*\n", "I'm suddenly eager to run off to my local library and check out *ALL THE BOOKS* This book gives a lot of insight on what goes into running a library and has you growing a sense of appreciation for those who put in the the work to keep everything afloat.

At times it was a whiplash experience for me in terms of enjoyment as I didn't always find much interest in some of the things that were being explored, but then something would pull me in and I'd be right back in the zone. ", "4.5 stars Hundreds of thousands of books were burned to nothing but ash and hundreds of thousands of books were damaged - enough to bring chills up the spine of any book lover reading this book about the fire at the Los Angeles Public Library that occurred on April 29, 1986. The research and the writing here are impeccable. The descriptions of the fire, the librarians\u2019 reactions, and the many, many volunteers who wanted to help - it\u2019s as if it\u2019s being reported in real time. The book, however, covers so much more than the story of the fire, although it\u2019s the main focus. It is in many ways a tribute to libraries and librarians and what they stand for and the importance of the library now and in the future. It is a personal testament to Orlean\u2019s love of libraries and her early experiences going to the library as a young child with her mother. I loved her reminiscing because it made me remember my own history with the public library in the neighborhood where I grew up. I remember the hours I spent there and some of the books that I read and the fond memories of when I worked there as a library \u201cpage\u201d in high school and through college. This is also a fascinating history of the LA public library and the library directors, the City Librarians, over the years. It\u2019s the story of the people who use the library. It\u2019s the story of the volunteers who after the fire \u201cworked for the next three days around the clock.....They formed a human chain, passing the books hand over hand from one person to the next, through the smoky building and out the door. It was as if, in this urgent moment, people, the people of Los Angeles formed a living library. They created for a short time, a system to protect and pass along shared knowledge, to save what we know for each other, which is what libraries do every day.\u201d I was also struck by the stunning words of a librarian, Jill Crane who helped with the cleanup and wrote in a poem:  \u201cWe held charred and water soaked  chunks of books in our hands, history, imagination, knowledge crumbing in our fingers. we packed what was left.\u201dShe also gives us Harry Peak\u2019s story, arrested but never charged with starting the fire and describes the difficulty of proving arson and proving that he was responsible. So much is contained in the book and I felt at times that it was a little scattered moving from the fire to her experiences, to the history and then to the fire and the investigation. But ultimately it was an an emotional book for me as a retired librarian, although not a public librarian, but mostly as a book lover. The scenes described of the burned and damaged books got me in my gut and the coming together of volunteers to do what they could got me in my heart and then when several years after the fire, the library reopened. This fabulous book is an ode to librarians and the public library, which represents the fabric of our society in so many ways. I received an advanced copy of this book from Simon & Schuster through NetGalley. ", "This is absolutely brilliant nonfiction - and a book about books - about libraries! \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f In April 1986, there was a large fire in the Los Angeles Public Library; so large, in fact, that over four hundred thousand books were burned completely and seven hundred thousand more were damaged. Initially, the thoughts were that this was arson, yet no one has been convicted, and a mystery still surrounds the act. The Library Book accomplishes several things. First, Susan Orlean has researched the history of the LA Public Library, and believe me, it\u2019s intriguing and page-turning.When examining the fire, Orlean presents a key player. Though he is a suspect, actor Harry Peak denies any involvement. Susan Orlean tells his backstory and presents the evidence clearly and with tension in such a way that it could be on 48 Hours or Dateline. Susan Orlean lovingly places her endearment for books on every page of this wonder. Her love for libraries and their vital role in communities is also resonantly conveyed. I don\u2019t want to say too much in this review because this book is all about the discovery. It\u2019s unique and heartwarming, even in the midst of a tragedy that would hurt any bibliophile\u2019s heart. More than anything, it\u2019s an ode to books and a gift to those who love them. Thank you to Simon Schuster for the ARC. All opinions are my own. My reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com", "An ode to libraries past and present. To the importance of books, and how they are used by malignant governments, book burning, to control and frighten their citizens. Although the main focus in on the library in Los Angeles and the fire that destroyed it and so many of their materials, this book is so much more. The way libraries have had to change and adapt in light of our electronic obsession, in order to stay viable in our communities. In a engaging manner, she takes the reader through history, past libraries like that in Alexandria, that burned more than once. Book burnings, and Bradbury's writing of Farenheit 451, as a warning to the future. Books mean so much, contain so much, as do libraries, readers, authors, they are the benchmark and the means of holding and spreading ideas, knowledge and yes of course entertainment. A story with a focal point but one that goes back and forth, with so much interesting tidbits in between. Read it!The fire in Los Angeles and it's effect on their librarians and patrons. A community pulling together to raise money to replace what they could. The man suspected of starting the fire, his past, as well as those of the people responsible for running this library system. ", "Susan Orlean was speaking with the Los Angeles Times about this book before its release....( I enjoyed listening to her speak on NPR as well).When talking about her interest in writing about a big city library this is what Susan said:  \u201cI could have done that anywhere. I like the idea of doing it in L.A., out of this contrarian idea that people don\u2019t associate libraries with L.A., which made it kind of delectable. That said, the 1986 fire ( forgive me), was a spark!The reason I find Susan\u2019s comment about folks not associating libraries with Los Angeles....is because I never really thought about it, but she\u2019s absolutely right. She\u2019s so right - it wasn\u2019t even in my consciousness, \u2018at all\u2019, and I live in California with family throughout L.A. I also never heard of this fire - shows you how asleep I was - and every L.A. person in my life too. My youngest daughter was a year old in 1986. Everything in this book was new to me. This past year - I\u2019ve used the public library system daily .... a zillion times more in one year ( at age 66)....than ALL my past years combined. Some readers might be appalled -aghast at such \u2018horror\u2019. I\u2019m only telling the truth. I wasn\u2019t much of a reader as a kid - I remember some lovely walks I took alone or with a friend to the library as a child to listen to \u2018the storytelling lady\u2019......but reading wasn\u2019t encouraged in my family. Not really. Actually nothing was encouraged - other than \u2018good behavior\u2019 at school and elsewhere. Many of you have heard this before - I\u2019m a very late bloomer passionate reader. I fell in love with reading-for-pleasure accidentally as an adult the year the book \u201cThe Glass Castle\u201d, by Jeannette Walls came out in the year 2006. I\u2019ve already shared my reading process in my Glass Castle review.....Point is.....I didn\u2019t come close to having the experience that Susan Orlean had - with books and reading- as she did. I don\u2019t have \u2018mom & me\u2019 reading memories to draw on and my dad died when I was 4. I\u2019m sincerely grateful to Susan Orlean - other authors with similar writing skills - to my long time reader friends \u2014( hearing \u2018their\u2019 childhood memories are a treasure for me)...All that said.....I liked MUCH of this book. I LEARNED A LOT about libraries - in general - not ONLY in L.A. - but my fear is I\u2019ll forget many details too. I don\u2019t own this book - ( I listened to Susan read her book as an Audiobook). It\u2019s a GORGEOUS PHYSICAL BOOK.... I think I\u2019d continue getting value if I owned it. I can\u2019t possibly hold all the details from the Audiobook alone. I took notes .....The parts I found more interesting I remember. Some parts of her book - she lost me - I just don\u2019t know what she was talking about. ( so then of course I felt stupid - like why haven\u2019t I heard of that book or person?).....Everything about the fire was fascinating.....( of course devastating in reality - HORRIFIC)..... but the THEN WHAT?..... The examination of this nightmare was fascinating and ALL THAT FOLLOWED......books going to restaurants - into freezers - learning about water damage - all the volunteers- and learning all the logistics of WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW.....in case..... such devastation should ever happen again ...And better ways to avoid it EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. Lots and lots of details answer questions I didn\u2019t even know I had. The pure knowledge was eye opening. Susan\u2019s Family was inspiring to me....her INCREDIBLE love for books, goes without saying. Her research was top notch. She gave us history & mystery - in the similar way Erik Larson did in \u201cThe Devil in the White City\u201d....She gave us personal history.. We got a great education on how libraries run and their importance for our communities. We were given history on the arson investigation....TONS TO GREAT INFORMATION......But....honesty I had mixed feelings about the ENTIRE PROCESS of Susan burning a book..... just to have the experience.... from her three week prior agony as to which book to choose .... to the NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD description of every detail............physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually in burning that book. My stomach was churning.....and not because I\u2019m a \u2018book-protecting-police-saint-( although I treat books with respect and cherish them as a live entity,too, somewhat)...but because Susan\u2019s book-burning-story was a little over-the-top dramatic for me. Something about it made me want to rebel from the general greatness from where this book comes from.....which is:A LOVE TRIBUTE TO OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES!4.5 stars...... rating up....this book deserves it. I personally didn\u2019t enjoy every part of it, but I did most of it \u2014 and my appreciation is much bigger than my small gripes.", "Susan Orlean is a true genius at bringing seemingly any subject to life in a manner which is utterly fascinating and immensely readable. I\u2019d even read instruction manuals and Congressional reports if she wrote them! Whether it\u2019s orchids, Rin Tin Tin, or unconventional travel adventures, her extensive research, writing style and the manner in which she weaves topics and time periods together results in books I recommend to a wide variety of readers. Her latest book, \u201cThe Library Book,\u201d is an examination of libraries and their changing and essential place in communities. For anyone who wonders about the relevance of libraries when books, magazines, and so much information is readily available on-line, Orlean\u2019s exploration of their continuing evolution into a community gathering place, a provider of social and cultural services, a place to find an abundance of printed material along with movies, music, and even musical instruments was captivating and very informative. Orlean also writes extensively about the extremely devastating fire at the Los Angeles Public Library on April 28, 1986 in which over a million books were either damaged or destroyed. Alongside that, she shares her personal experiences with libraries and how important they have been in her life.\u201cOur visits to the library were never long enough for me. The place was so bountiful. I loved wandering around the bookshelves, scanning the spines until something happened to catch my eye. Those visits were dreamy, frictionless interludes that promised I would leave richer than I arrived. It wasn\u2019t like going to the store with my mom, which guaranteed a tug-of-war between what I wanted and what my mother was willing to buy me, because I could have anything I wanted in the library. After we checked out, I loved being in the car and having all the books we\u2019d gotten stacked on my lap, pressing me under their solid, warm weight, their Mylar covers sticking a bit to my thighs. It was such a thrill leaving a place with things you hadn\u2019t paid for; such a thrill, anticipating the new books we would read.\u201dHer lyrical and insightful writing about books and how alive they always are should speak to anyone who loves books, reading, and libraries.\u201cA book feels like a thing alive in this moment, and also alive on a continuum, from the moment the thoughts about it first percolated in the writer\u2019s mind to the moment it sprang off the printing press\u2014a lifeline that continues as someone sits with it and marvels over it, and it continues on, time and time and time. Once words and thoughts are poured into them, books are no longer just paper and ink and glue: They take on a kind of human vitality.\u201dI recommend this book wholeheartedly to all readers and book lovers. Not to be missed.Thank you to Simon and Schuster and NetGalley for for providing an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.", "3.5.. mixed opinions on this, but I\u2019ll post something later! It dragged on a bit too much at the end, and as I read, I got more exasperated.-Okay! Time to explain myself.In The Library Book Orlean aims to offer a well-rounded discussion of libraries, rooted by the story of the Los Angeles Library fire in 1986. When I read the summary of this book, there was a lot of emphasis placed on the library fire, which really drew me in. I was curious to learn more about it, and hoped this book would provide a detailed, exciting explanation. Instead, I found Orlean's narrative style rather choppy, and lacking focus. The narrative is hard to follow, especially since Orlean introduces so many different 'story lines'\u2014historical (sometimes multiple historical threads going at once), observational, her own memories\u2014 and then alternates between each one in chapters that vary in length. While this usually keeps a book moving and helps me maintain focus, I found it hard to remember the details of the previous section on that same topic when I returned to a chapter on that same topic. Since Orlean jumps between all these topics so often, it makes the whole narrative hard to follow, and creates a lack of focus in general. While I appreciate library history and all the other details Orlean explored, I wanted to learn more about the fire itself. It was hard to mush all the different chapters I had read about the fire into one coherent story, since all the chapters are broken up and separated. I feel like this book should be marketed less as one about the fire, and one more about libraries (or the LA central library) in general. I think that would have helped me 'tame' my expectations regarding the focus of the book.My last complaint is that sometimes Orlean gets so deep in small plot points that really have no purpose. She goes on and on with small, topical details about library history, which especially began to grate on me in the end. I felt that the book really dragged on in the end, as I began to get sick of the lack of focus on the fire, and the endless, seemingly meaningless, details about the library, or libraries in general. I felt like Orlean was listing trivia points for no point other than to show off all the weird things she discovered during her research. It would have been nice to see all these details cohered into some sort of larger purpose, but that didn't happen. I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but as I continued, I began to get more frustrated. If you are curious about library history and the LA public library system, then I would definitely read this book, just to learn some history. Orlean's writing is strong and propels the book forward, at least making this a pleasurable read. I did really enjoy parts of this book, so I can't completely write it off. Thank you to NetGalley and Simon Schuster for providing me a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. ", "The Library Book by Susan Orlean is a 2018 Simon & Schuster publication. I couldn\u2019t have been happier when this book finally reached the top of my TBR pile. I\u2019ve been looking forward to reading it for a long time. Naturally, I was drawn to the \u2018books about books\u2019 aspect, but was also mortified by the true crime elements. Who on earth would deliberately set fire to a public library?Susan Orlean attempts to answer that very question, while detailing the rich history of the Los Angeles public library. What a fascinating journey it was \u2013The author, who is not originally from LA, had not heard about the fire that ravaged the central library back in 1986, until an offhand remark piqued her curiosity. Her research unearthed the library\u2019s storied past, which is a compelling drama all on its own. But she also attempts to shed light on the fire and the primary suspect, Harry Peak. Was Peak guilty, or just a consummate liar? The book begins on a horrifying note. In 1986, the library housed a very impressive number of books and records, which included a large \u2018stacks\u2019 area. The building was not up to code either, so it only took a short time for the old dry paper to ignite and spread rapidly. Any type of fire which destroys a home or business is difficult to hear about. But, of course as a book lover, I was nearly in physical pain reading about the hundreds of books damaged by fire, smoke or water. It was also disconcerting that the fire barely made a blip in the press. Granted, there were other major news stories going on at the time. But, now for the first time, thanks to the amazing work this author did, we can see how the fire effected the city, the patrons, and the librarians. We also get a close -up and personal look at how a library functions and the important work librarians do. What an amazing job. Working with the public has its drawbacks, of course, but I was truly impressed with how the librarians handle all the phone calls, answer questions on a myriad of topics, and cope with situations such as how to handle the homeless who often use the library to as place of shelter during operating hours. The wealth of information and history surrounding the Los Angeles public library is vast and completely absorbing, especially if you are passionate about books and libraries. The mystery surrounding the fire, however, is perplexing and frustrating. Orlean presents the facts, and I must agree with her opinion of the prime suspect. The book is categorized as \u2018True Crime\u2019, but more than anything I think it falls into the history category. It is also a book that makes one truly appreciate the importance of libraries. I have always supported libraries, and I try to remind people that although Netgalley, Edelweiss, KU, and Scribd, provide thousands of books right there at your fingertips,( and I am as addicted to these services as anyone else), the library will never reject you \u2018based on the information you provided in your profile\u2019, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime for a library card. So, don\u2019t forget to take advantage of everything the library has to offer- Books- both print and digital, audiobooks, music, movies, documents, newspapers, magazines, research material, job information, book clubs, children\u2019s story hour, free access to computers and the internet, literacy programs, programs to help learn new skills, community clubs, and a host of other services- most of them free. There are many ways to support your local library: volunteer or donate any books or magazines you don\u2019t plan to re-read or keep, and if you are in a position to do so, offer a little financial help from time to time. You can even deduct it on your taxes!! Funding for libraries is not always stable or dependable.Obviously, book lovers need to read this one, as well as history buffs. While it starts off on a somber note, by the end of the book you will feel as though this eye- opening journey was a rewarding adventure. I am in awe of the LA public library, and its rich history, and have an even greater appreciation for the importance of libraries in general. Orlean did a terrific job with her exhaustive research and it is obvious she put in many hours with those involved with the library and with those associated with Harry Peak. The book is well- organized, and unlike some non-fiction history books, I never zoned out or lost interest. If you love books or libraries, history, or True Crime this book is one you won\u2019t want to miss out on! 4.5 stars", "Libraries have played a integral part of my life from the time I was a kid. My first library was the Bradbury Library where the magical world of reading opened to me and I participated in my first summer reading program. I graduated to more libraries, a larger world of books, conversations with librarians, and a variety of summer reading programs. When I first found out about Susan Orlean\u2019s The Library Book, I was naturally intrigued by the title. When the description featured the 1986 Los Angeles Central Library fire, I was mortified but still wanted to read what was being billed as true crime in hopes that the Los Angeles police brought the criminals to justice. What I found out by reading this book about libraries is to judge a book by its cover, or, in this case, it\u2019s reviews. Susan Orlean spent a good part of her youth going to libraries with her mother. The trips were magical and she could never wait until her next trip to find out what books were in store for her. Life happened. Orlean became a renown author and a frequenter of book stores rather than libraries for a good portion of her life. She also decided that she was done researching for and writing books as the time spent on them took her away from her job and family. Then her husband accepted a job in Los Angeles and the family relocated. One day, Orlean\u2019s son received a school assignment to interview a civil servant. He chose to speak with a librarian, and Orlean took her then six-year-old son to their local branch library. As if by magic, her feelings of trips to the library with her mother returned. Orlean became a library patron once again. Around that time, her mother was diagnosed with senile dementia. She decided that she would write another book for her mother and have it focus on libraries. The library book may detail the Los Angeles Central Library fire of April 29, 1986, but the book is in part the history of the Los Angeles library system. As a history connoisseur, I found this facet of Orlean\u2019s research to be fascinating. She heads back in time to the founding of the library in the 1870s when Los Angeles was a sleepy town located in the San Bernardino valley. The gold rush had passed and Los Angeles was a town of orange groves and avocado trees, essentially a farming community. Yet, the migrants who start flocking to California were literary minded and wanted a library similar to ones they used in eastern cities. By 1872, the library had been born. A good fifty years before women gained suffrage, the first four head librarians in Los Angeles were women, until the times caught up with them. These women, highlighted by the impeccable Mary Jones, brought the library to the forefront of national libraries, and eastern cities took note. It was not until Andrew Carnegie made libraries his philanthropy of choice that the Los Angeles library modernized. Carnegie designated Los Angeles as one of the 1700 sites nationwide that would receive funding for a new building for its central location as well as branch sites. This came at a time when Los Angeles had become a leading city in the west, a center of commerce and the motion picture industry. People flocked to California from the east, and the library kept expanding as books overflowed from each new location. The Los Angeles city council voted that Bertram Goodhue should design the new library building. The architecture would rival the central libraries in New York and Chicago and would provide Angelenos space enough to house a book collection now numbering in the hundred thousands. Andrew Carnegie had cemented Los Angeles as an intellectual hub of the west. Through her impeccable research, Orlean describes the Library fire in detail while also interviewing the present and future of libraries with current Los Angeles librarians as well as writing of the entire history of the city library system. With all the facets of the story, I was mesmerized as though I had entered a central library building myself. What I found most telling is that librarians and Orlean concur that libraries factor more than ever in society in today\u2019s digital age. People want a free space to be able to borrow books, videos, conduct research, attend a variety of programs, and take young children to story hour to introduce them to the magical world of books. Orlean weaves the past, present, and future in her story seamlessly as I read through her book over the course of one day. Libraries still matter, and Susan Orlean makes that point clear in her touching ode to public libraries everywhere. 4 stars", "If I hadn\u2019t read it on my Kindle, I would have considered burning this book after I finished it. Yeah, I finished it even though I was bored senseless. The author did a lot of research so I gave her 2 stars for sticking with it. I could picture her with a Rolodex of notecards with every last fact that she had uncovered about this massive fire and anything else vaguely connected. Then she didn\u2019t stop until she had put EVERY last fact into this book. I like libraries. I\u2019m sorry this one burned in 1986. I\u2019m sorry that the NYT put this on their 100 Notable Books list for 2018. I kept reading to figure out why. Never did figure it out.", "\"In the library, time is dammed up \u2013 not just stopped but saved. The library is a gathering pool of narratives and of the people who come to find them. It is where we can glimpse immortality; in the library, we can live forever.\"Like nearly everyone else here on Goodreads, libraries have always been like an oasis for me, a place I could escape to and be alone if I felt so inclined, or as part of a community of people that share the same love of books. My library card is one of my most treasured belongings. It has given me countless hours of pleasure over the years and allowed me to visit extraordinary places and meet remarkable individuals. Author Susan Orlean shares the same adoration of books and libraries, and it\u2019s quite evident here in this book which is much like an ode of sorts to libraries. In 1986, I was still in high school. I guess that\u2019s why the news of the tragic fire in the Los Angeles Central Library completely escaped my notice. I was writing papers and solving algebraic equations rather than listening to the news. This book educated me on the subject of this catastrophe in a very engaging manner. The real magnitude of the fire, smoke and water damage to the books was staggering to say the least! Orlean attempts to unravel the mystery of just how the fire was started, but to this day there is no definitive answer \u2013 although there was one prime suspect throughout. We learn a lot about this suspect and the reasons why he may or may not have committed the crime. Arson investigations in general are very difficult crimes to prove and this one no less so. This is so much more than just a true crime piece, however, and for that I was quite pleased. In fact, I found \u2018chasing\u2019 after the suspect to be the least compelling portion of the book. Instead, I gobbled up all the fascinating history of Central Library, libraries in general, and librarians across the years. Such a diverse group of men and women have been in charge of the library since it was established in 1873. Perhaps the most unconventional individual, at least from what I\u2019ve garnered here, was Charles Fletcher Lummis. He caught the nation\u2019s attention when he walked thousands of miles on foot from Cincinnati to Los Angeles to work for the Los Angeles Times prior to his engagement with the library. I found the reason for opposition to Lummis\u2019s appointment to be rather comical: \"\u2026 he never set foot in a library school, wore eccentric corduroy suits and was known to drink and swear on occasion.\" In fact, I have to remember to pass on this little tidbit to the director of my hometown library. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find it just as amusing!There\u2019s so much more to be found in the pages of this wonderful book. Andrew Carnegie\u2019s philanthropy as well as that of Bill and Melinda Gates is also touched upon. The changes that libraries have undergone over the years, the introduction of technology, and the initiatives to keep them a vital part of our communities also kept me glued to the page. I admire Susan Orleans' tremendous effort in researching this book. I recommend it to anyone that loves their library. I think this book would be best viewed as one about the history of the LA Central Library versus putting the emphasis on the fire. The fire is a large and fascinating, but only partial, part of the overall picture here. I'm rating this 4 versus 5 stars due to the fact I found the jumping around in time and narrative to be a little bit distracting. Just a minor complaint considering how much I enjoyed reading this one.\"\u2026 libraries have persisted, and they have grown, and they will certainly endure.\"", "Like a library, The Library Book has it all. With the mostly-forgotten Los Angeles library fire of 1986 as a backdrop, Orlean takes us on a journey that is a mix of true crime mystery, character study, history, political intrigue, tragedy, comedy, romance, and so much more. The research she reveals about head librarians spanning centuries seems like an impossible record to find--but, of course, libraries would hold on to all that information.She structures the book as an even pace, blending the most intriguing bits with what might otherwise be less riveting cultural context. As it is, there's never a dull moment. For the millions of us who cherish our local libraries, this is the love letter we've long held in our hearts but didn't have the words--or background knowledge--to say it.", "5\u2605\u201cAll the things that are wrong in the world seem conquered by a library\u2019s simple unspoken promise: Here is my story, please listen; here I am, please tell me your story.\u201dFor many people, I imagine libraries are like places of worship - everyone is made to feel welcome and part of a greater community.In the case of a library, it\u2019s a community not only of readers, but also of people looking for someone to answer their questions, migrants taking literacy classes, people needing help with bureaucratic forms, teens wanting a safe place to hang out, collectors with memorabilia to donate . . . the list is endless . . . although it does eventually end with homeless people seeking a safe place to sit out of the weather. (If they fall asleep, they may be turfed out.)The Los Angeles Public Library has had a particularly lively history and some unbelievably colourful people running it. Charles Lummis was one of the most charismatic and peculiar men around, I suspect, even in the wilds of Los Angeles in 1885. Lummis was in Ohio when he was hired, and he decided to walk from Ohio to California, ostensibly to find out about America, but really to make an entrance when he got there. And he did. His \u201ctramp\u201d was covered by the newspapers and he was famous by the time he arrived. It all helps with funding!This is him in his sombrero and bright green, wide-wale, corduroy suit with red Indian-patterned cummerbund which he wore all the time. He\u2019d fit right in with today\u2019s Hollywood.[photograph of Charles Lummis]The author introduces each chapter with the library details of various books that might apply to the chapter. The central story is about the LA library and the devastating fire, but the history of early libraries and its own establishment are woven in with the details of the fire and the mystery surrounding the suspected arsonist. Susan Orlean is a well-regarded author and is also a staff writer at The New Yorker Magazine, so you know you\u2019re in good hands. What could have been a dry history book is more like investigative journalism, with plenty of gossip and innuendo \u2013 this is Los Angeles, remember! Lummis was famous for his drunken parties and wild friends, and his section of the book reads like something out of the hippy days nearly a century later. There really is nothing new under the sun.I won\u2019t attempt to summarise Orlean\u2019s excellent research or the police hunt for the perpetrator, but I do want to mention some of the book-burnings she describes. She even tried to burn one herself, to see what it would feel like, but she had a terrible time bringing herself to do it.\u201cOnce words and thoughts are poured into them, books are no longer just paper and ink and glue: They take on a kind of human vitality. The poet Milton called this quality in books \u2018the potency of life.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t sure I had it in me to be a killer.\u201dIn another part of the world:\u201cIn Senegal, the polite expression for saying someone died is to say his or her library has burned.\u201dThey say that history belongs to those who write it. That\u2019s true \u2013 to a point.\u201cThe first recorded instance of book burning was in 213 BC, when Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang decided to incinerate any history books that contradicted his version of the past. In addition, he buried more than four hundred scholars alive.\u201dWhat a frightening thought. But then in our own time, during WW2, the Holocaust attempted to wipe out an entire people, including the books.\u201cSpecial book-burning squads known as \u2018Brenn-Kommandos\u2019 were sent out to burn libraries and synagogues. . . .  \u201cBy the end of the war, more than one third of all the books in Germany were gone.\u201dMeanwhile, back in the States\u201cIn the 1940s, for instance, a schoolteacher named Mabel Riddle, with the support of the Catholic Church, began a campaign to collect and burn comic books because of their energetic portrayal of crime and sex. . . many local parishes sponsored their own comic-book fires. In a few instances, nuns lit the first match.\u201d. . . \u201cDestroying a culture\u2019s books is sentencing it to something worse than death: It is sentencing it to seem as if it never lived.\u201dBack to Los Angeles. The fire and its aftermath are described in horrifying detail, but the amazing thing is that it\u2019s the water from the firefighting that causes so much damage. Mould and mildew are as bad as fire. Did you know you have to freeze a wet book to salvage it? What do you do with thousands of them? The fish markets! The logistics of packing wet books, moving, storing, freezing, rebuilding the library are extensive and exhausting.Oh, one more thing. When pseudo-science books started becoming popular, Lummis instituted his own \u201cLiterary Pure Food Act\u201d, branded the books with a \u201cpoison\u201d symbol, and added inserts.\u201cThe cards, shaped like bookmarks, said, \u2018For Later and More Scientific Treatment of This Subject, Consult______,\u2019 followed by a blank space for librarians to list better books on the topic.\u201dMore libraries, more librarians, sombreros and all!Thanks to NetGalley and Simon and Schuster for the preview copy of this fascinating bit of history.", "3.5* rounded up!\u201cThe library is a gathering pool of narratives and of the people who come to find them. It is where we can glimpse immortality; in the library, we can live forever.\u201dThis book follows, and is a thorough investigation, into the Los Angeles public library fire. This fire occurred on April 29 1986 and destroyed more than 400,000 books, as well as rare photographs, manuscripts and first editions. However, this was not largely publicised or given as much attention due the overshadowing on the story of the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine. Not only was this a comprehensive and an extensive investigation into how the fire possibly started, it also focused on the interviews of the prime suspect, Harry Peak, and what type of man he was. This book also extended out of focusing on the fire and provided a detailed history of the Los Angeles public library. Susan Orlean details how the library is ever-changing and shifting and can be a safe haven for people, for example, during the war and through the depression in America. I was particularly interested in the women's history behind the management of the library and this was presented and detailed very well. There was also a focus on the new forward-facing future of libraries and the involvement of the ever-changing digital world.What made this book good was the incorporation of many different sources of people. Susan Orlean details these characters; from security, to genealogy, music experts and the heads of the library, each character brings their own fascinating tales of their time in the library, and how working in a library is so much more than stacking shelves of books. Each story was bursting with unique life and responsibilities. ", "Some of the fondest childhood memories I have were of my Mother taking me to the library. I held my Moms hand as we walked in and as so as I saw my section, I begged to let go of her hand as I nearly ran to grab new books that my parents and I would read together. My Mother\u2019s arms were full of mysteries, best sellers, biographies, cookbooks and of course, my books. I loved seeing my Mom stack the books on the counter and then that sound. The sound of the library clerk stamping the library card with the due date in each book.As I grew older, I was allowed to ride my bike to the library and using my own library card, I ventured to the teen sectiion for the latest Judy Blume book. Now as adult, my love of the library continues as I carry more books than I should to the counter to hear the electronic beep of knowing that for three weeks, those books are mine. The Library has been an essential part of my life so I was thrilled to have a chance to read Susan Orlean\u2019s new book, The Library Book.This nonfictional account of the 1986 fire of the Los Angeles Central Library. Orlean recounts in The Library Book, the fire that destroyed over 400,000 books and damaged another 700,000 more in the span of seven hours.The fire and the mystery of who set the fire alone would be a compelling tale by itself but Orlean gives us so much more.According to the Public Library Manifesto published by UNESCO, \u201cThe library is a prerequisite to let citizens make use of their right to information and freedom of speech. Free access to information is necessary in a democratic society, for open debate and creation of public opinion.\u201dOrlean goes to great lengths and depth to showcase the importance and role of libraries in our communities. The Library Book is such a captivating novel with a blend of mystery, history and thorough analysis of the future of libraries.Read Susan Orlean\u2019s novel and you will have visited the mystery, geography, biography, humor, history and political sections of a library all in one book. Thank you to Netgalley for an advance copy of this book. My reviews are fair and unbiased. #netgalley #thelibrarybook", "It feels as though the author was searching for adequate information to fill this book. It covers so many topics, it spreads itself thin. It has breadth rather than depth. It is not only about the huge fire that destroyed the Los Angeles Central Library on April 29, 1986, but also about the man singled out as having started the fire. Yet you know at the start, his culpability will be left unresolved, and therefore, other topics of interest had to be added. Lots and lots of other information is added.The focus of the book expands. It starts with the incendiary event and spreads to cover the history of this one library and then on to the purpose and function of libraries in general. The telling hops back and forth in time and subject matter. We are given details about the fire itself. We are given details about fires in general. We are given details about the Los Angeles Central Library\u2019s history. We are given information about other well-known libraries. We learn about patrons, security guards and the library's various employees. We learn about the deplorable condition of the library before the fire and about its subsequent renovation. This is also a book about books and the purpose and function of libraries in general, both in the past and how they should/could be utilized in the future. How they can be used to reach out to the poor and the homeless. How they can be used to educate. How they can be used by all ages--the young and the old and teenagers too. The ins and outs of the functioning of a library in the past, the present and in the future are all covered. Digitalization, voice over, e-books the place of computers in the library complex. Modernization, changes in societal patterns and other world events too. All are discussed because a library mirrors the world around it. There is information about new scientific discoveries concerning fire combustion and arson. You might say that this book itself mimics a library. It contains lots and lots of tidbits of information. The book is in this way kind of clever, albeit jumbled in presentation. There is another clever, but annoying, aspect of the book. You know how each library book has an identification number on it? Each chapter in this book is numbered and after the chapter number follows the title, author, publication date and number of several books. These books indicate what the following chapter will be about. The author never says what these numbers are! My guess is that they were either the library identification code or an ISBN number. If you listen to the audiobook version, the reading of this irrelevant number becomes exceedingly annoying. Reading the paper version, you can just skim over the number! The information is presented in a jumbled manner. The book needs editing. Some of the details presented are just not important. Interesting information is mixed with the mediocre. The prose, the writing, is a mix of good and mediocre too. There is not much humor. Some of the information in this book \nIS\n interesting. There is no denying that. I found particularly interesting the biographical details related to the head librarians Charles F. Lummis and John F. Szabo. The information about Andrew Carnegie\u2019s philanthropy and active support of libraries is both relevant and interesting, but other books provide much greater depth. We are back again to the same problem--in covering so many topics, the book spreads itself thin.What stands out for me as special is how well Orlean draws the ambiance, the feel of a library you have come to love. You are able to feel at home in a public space! The quietness that pervades a library is comforting and relaxing. One is enveloped in a soothing sense of peace. Orlean\u2019s words capture this.The author reads her own audiobook. She reads slowly. VERY slowly. Although this does not annoy me, I am pretty darn sure it will irritate others. Her pronunciation of foreign words is poor. The little humor that is written into the lines does not come to the surface. Her performance is fine, but you recognize that she is not a trained narrator. The more I read by Susan Orlean, the more it becomes evident to me that she is best at writing short articles. Her longer books don\u2019t hold together very well; they feel as a hodgepodge, a mashing together of separate pieces of writing. I give the book three stars for its interesting content.************************Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend 4 stars*The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession 3 stars*The Library Book 3 stars*Animalish 3 stars", "\"Usually, a fire is red and orange and yellow and black. The fire in the library was colorless. You could look right through it, as if it were a sheet of glass.\"Like looking through tears comes to mind. The catastrophic fire that engulfed the Los Angeles Central Library on April 29, 1986 was beyond description. The loss is immeasurable in terms of rare volumes of books defining our human past, our on-going present, and our ever changing stepping stones into the future. There's a kind of hush while taking that all in......The Library Book by Susan Orlean is a love sonnet to every book we humans have ever opened and a cherished memory with each slip of the hand gliding across page after page with tactile delight. It is an extension of one's self entering into a mysterious land far beyond the familiar. Curiously, unlike a first love, opening a new anxiously awaited volume can repeat that flicker of a heartbeat again and again throughout a lifetime.Susan Orlean takes us on a tour of the inner chambers of the library as an architectural feat. We envision its beauty in moments of before and after. Her research is impeccable into the history of libraries in general and the Los Angeles Library in particular. Orlean lines this research with countless interviews of eye-witnesses and staff who were there that fateful day. She brings in anecdotes from the city's first librarians way back in 1859 when public libraries first appeared.Believe me, this is not a dull, dry, dusty version winding through a maze of bookshelves. Orlean adds sizzle with almost combative Sumo wrestlers vying for the position of head librarian. We'll meet a cast of characters both quirky and intellectual. Men were the preferred choice unlike the usual visual of the ol' school marm lady librarian. One interim female librarian refused to turn over her keys and bodily sat in all the meetings. I have the keys to the kingdom, Buddy......Orlean provides a high interest thread about Harry Peak who was suspected of setting the fire. Harry's rendition of that day kept changing like a well-handled Hollywood script. She injects his little scenarios in just the right places. You'll be tossing back and forth on Harry.It's my belief that libraries were elevated to great new heights due to the philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie, who launched a library building project in 1890. Carnegie was born into poverty and gained phenomenal wealth in steel and railroads. He never forgot his love of books. Even small towns across America bear his name in the entrance of their libraries to this day. And even more success is noted that in the expansion it was necessary to hire more librarians........and oh, there were throngs of women this time, Folks. The Library Book is quite the reading experience. It is one in which you, indeed, feel part of the journey from your own childhood romps behind library shelves that house the dreams of kings and queens. A book cares not of your status or the lack thereof. It just beckons you in to stay forever.", "So, it turns out that people in LA do more than drink kale smoothies, have inventive but wholly unnecessary plastic surgery (\u201cI just had my appendix done and it looks FANTASTIC on an MRI!\u201d), and be impossibly (albeit generically) attractive while waiting tables hoping for their big break. In addition to doing those things, they also go to the library.*A while back, I wrote about libraries, the internet, and probably something scatological (knowing me), but the lens of that piece was very much my own (white, suburban) experience\u2014that is, I considered the concept of libraries as I\u2019ve always known them: namely, repositories of books and quiet places in which to study and do research for scholastic purposes. As Orlean details in this mostly engaging account of the fire that destroyed the Los Angeles public library in 1986, however, libraries are so much more, and never more so than now (somewhat ironically, given that book readership has flatlined at best). Libraries are on the front lines in trying to help the homeless (not only are they freely accessible portals to the internet, but they also provide training and access to social programs\u2014and, perhaps above all else, they are simply a place to BE, one that is warm and safe and open and friendly), and they are often curators of important cultural and historical memorabilia. Those training and social programs are broadly available, however, and are hugely important to numerous other members of the general populace, including immigrants, the elderly, the disabled, and a host of others (not to mention overwhelmed parents who need a place to take their kids that doesn\u2019t cost any money and at least provides the possibility of diverting them from destroying potted plants or pulling the wings off dragonflies for a brief period of time). And libraries are also apparently invaluable people who miss askjeeves.com and are too lazy to seek out basic informational tidbits on their phones, because it\u2019s a little baffling how many people call libraries to find out random pieces of trivia. In short, libraries, as they always have been, remain essential to the fabric of their communities, even if people don\u2019t go there as much for the books anymore. It makes one wonder whether \u201clibrary\u201d\u2014a word that conjures up images of imposing stacks of dense tomes, finger-wagging shush monsters, and yellowed card catalogs\u2014is even the right term. Maybe we start calling them community engagement centers? Multimedia hubs? Nerd holes? I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m sure we can come up with something that more accurately describes what they do and what they\u2019re for (note: on that latter point, \u201cnerd holes\u201d is probably a bad suggestion, because I\u2019m not entirely sure I want to know what a nerd hole is for).Up above, I called this a \u201cmostly engaging\u201d account; it flags at times, in part because it turns out that the primary suspect in the *spoiler alert* still unsolved fire may have just been a flighty attention seeker and the mystery surrounding the fire draws to an unsatisfying close (like a Ziploc baggie that just won\u2019t seal right). Still, Orlean\u2019s provides a really interesting look at the evolution of the library and its continued vitality as a civic institution despite, or perhaps because of, evolving technology. *I\u2019m totally kidding, Los Angelinos\u2014I know you\u2019re all actually witty and delightful book nerds with a taste for good Scotch and unaltered internal organs, even if you haven\u2019t seen National Treasure, which is an almost unforgiveable offense against cultural literacy; but, sometimes you need to perpetuate a stereotype to make a point, you know? And you know you really do fret about how your appendix looks\u2026", "The staggering loss and damage of hundreds of thousands of books is enough to pierce the heart of any book lover. LA\u2019s Central Library went up in smoke and fire in April of 1986. This book is an accounting of the fire itself, and the massive volunteer effort to save the books and rebuild the library 3 years later. Books that were salvageable were moved to freezers to prevent mold. Unfrozen 2 years later, it was a complicated process to dry out and restore and rebind. To this day the cause of the fire is an unsolved mystery, although several theories are presented. There was a suspect, Harry Peak, an affable and charming pathological liar, but there was not enough evidence to charge him. His story makes this an even more compelling read.But mostly this book is a love letter to libraries and the people who run them. The busy day in the life of a library is detailed, and we are introduced to a bevy of colorful City Librarians, both past and present. I am most impressed with how libraries took themselves into the future of the internet age and expanded their programs to make them increasingly relevant to their communities. The future of libraries is seen as partnering with the internet, not competing with it. The book is full of interesting tidbits and facts, such as Ray Bradbury\u2019s connection to libraries and the writing of Fahrenheit 451, the science behind fire investigations, the changing role of employing women in libraries, the issue of libraries increasingly being used as havens for the homeless\u2026.and so much more. Most fun fact: Cleveland, Ohio is the headquarters of OverDrive, the company that created the concept of e-book loans. When anyone in the world borrows a book or audio via OverDrive a small light appears on a large wall map showing where and what was borrowed. As someone who has a personal connection to Cleveland and borrows most of my e-books and audiobooks on OverDrive, this makes me ridiculously happy!I read this with my book buddy, Marialyce. Both of us grew up within walking distance of a library and we had fun reminiscing about the many hours we both spent in libraries and the delicious feeling of walking out with an armload of books, a pleasure we both still enjoy to this day.Bottom line: if you love books, reading, and libraries this is a must-read.", ". . . if she could have chosen any profession in the world, she would have been a librarian.December 6, 2016 was one of the greatest days of my life. It was the day I started work in the children's department of my local library. To this day, I still get a thrill every time I walk in the building via that special \"Employees Only\" entrance. I think to myself, \"I can't believe I work at The Library,\" and I consider myself very, very lucky.I'm sure by now you know that Orlean's latest book is about the devastating fire that occurred at the Los Angeles Public Library in 1986. She covers the aftermath of the disaster, the recovery and rebuilding, the Herculean attempts to save hundreds of thousands of damaged books, and the story of the young man accused of setting the blaze. But Orlean also manages to weave in the history and importance of libraries, with a look to the future with libraries becoming more community gathering place than warehouses for books. All in all, a fascinating look at one of the world's best loved institutions. I highly recommend this one to book lovers everywhere.It wasn't that time stopped in the library. It was as if it were captured here, collected here, and in all libraries - and not only my time, my life, but all human time as well. In the library, time is dammed up - not just stopped but saved. The library is a gathering pool of narratives and of the people who come to find them. It is where we can glimpse immortality: in the library, we can live forever.", "This is a wonderful book about libraries. If you're like me, and borrow almost ALL your books from the local library, then you will like enjoy the fascinating information in it.Not only does the author describes its history, how they function, interesting facts and figures, but she also focuses on\u00a0the events surrounding the devastating, large, and mysterious fire that destroyed many titles of the the L.A. Central Library on 1986.There is a short section devoted to Overdrive, the digital distributor of ebooks and audiobooks for libraries. I get almost all of my titles from them, it's easy to use and I would have loved hearing more about the history and operations of this company.The author also explores many other aspects of libraries and the events surrounding the fire. Overall, a wonderful title for those of us who make use and appreciate all the services libraries provide to communities.", "\n\"A library is as much a portal as it is a place\u2014it is a transit point, a passage.\"\nI guess I'm a bit of an outlier when it comes to this book. It was OK, but nothing remarkable for me. I hate to say that because so many recommended it to me, and I wish I could say I loved it. It wasn't all bad though, not by a long shot. I had actually never heard about the Los Angeles Public Library burning in 1986, was unaware of the tragedy of so many books and items lost in this fire. I am glad to have read this book and learned about it; however, it was anxiety-inducing for me to read! I just kept thinking of my own beloved library, of how it would feel to have such a tragedy happen, even though it's much smaller than the Los Angeles Public Library. All those beloved books, most of which I have personally touched, either because I purchased and catalogued them, or because I have changed the cutter numbers to letters on every book in the adult collection (a project that lasted a couple of years!).... all those books, going up in smoke? Oh, that makes my heart ache to think about!!! No doubt, many people can understand this, even those who don't work in a library! One thing that many of my friends enjoyed about this book is learning about the inner workings of libraries. These parts was actually a little boring for me to read since I'm already familiar with this. At one point, Susan Orlean describes burning a book, to see what it would feel like to watch a book go up in flames. She describes how it was all but impossible for her to ever throw away old books and would rather donate them instead, no matter their condition. \"I can\u2019t. I am happy if I can give them away or donate them. But I can\u2019t throw a book in the trash, no matter how hard I try.\"Let me speak for the librarians and library clerks out there -- we do not want your old, moldy books! I know, I know. I totally understand how horrifying it seems to most people to throw away a book, how utterly heartless, almost tantamount to murder! I used to be one of those people. That quickly changed once I started working in a library. Rest assured: You are not sending a soul into oblivion. It is OK to throw out some books; sometimes they are unsalvageable and to have moldy books in libraries creates a huge problem for the other books in the collection. Don't bring that nasty shit to us! OK, public service announcement over. The Library Book is very well written and I can see why it has such high ratings. I don't want to be a deterrent to anyone reading this book; I think most people will indeed love it. I liked it, yes; it just wasn't the most interesting for me, and as I said, I was filled with anxiety reading this book, imagining something similar happening to my own library. I'm wondering if I should add this book to the horror shelf!? The fire at the Los Angeles Central Library burned for more than 7 hours with temperatures reaching 2,000\u00ba F. Almost half a million books were destroyed, and a further 700,000 were damaged. If that doesn't make your heart stop and the breath catch in your throat, you are a cold-hearted person indeed! Or maybe you're just someone who doesn't like to read, in which case I'm not sure why you're reading this review. But hey, no judgment. Books aren't for everyone and so maybe reviews are the way to go, kind of like a super condensed version of the book, about 350-500 pages less. You're gonna miss a hell of a lot, but hey, again, to each their own. So, all in all, I think this book is a wonderful love story to libraries and books. The author's love of both shines on every page. I also am glad Ms. Orlean is educating her readers on just what all goes on in libraries, what all it takes to get the books, DVDs, CDs, etc to you, our patrons. We who work in libraries don't just sit around reading all day, much as we'd love to. I don't know how many times people have said to me, \"Oh! You work in a library! How nice to get paid to read all day!\" or \"A library? Doesn't that get boring?\" Um, nope! I could tell you some stories to assure you there's nothing boring about it! If you read this book, you will understand that! I am glad to have learned about the fire, anxiety-inducing as it was. I also enjoyed reading about the services and programs the LA Central Library offers and has offered to its patrons. It is inspiring to learn of the different ways libraries reach out to their communities and provide services that are so beneficial. Libraries aren't just book lenders anymore; they are so much more! If you haven't visited your local library recently, I urge you to go. They will be happy to have you! 3 stars for my enjoyment of the book, but I'm bumping it up to 4 because of the detail and quality of writing.", "[4.5 stars] If you didn't admire libraries and the amount of work and passion it takes to run them before reading this, you will after. It's not only an examination of the terrible fire at the Los Angeles Public Library in 1986, but also an ode to the people who work and have worked there, the ones just passing through, and much, much more. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this having not had great experiences with Orlean's previous work, but this one is in its own category, in my opinion. And sure, writing a book about libraries is a bit of low-hanging fruit when catering to readers, but we really will take a book about books any day. Plus this one is top notch. I don't know if it's something I'd necessarily re-read, but there are definitely some passages in it that I'd love to get printed out and hung on my wall. For those passages alone it is worth reading.", "My Rating: 4.5 stars Have you ever come across a book that felt like it was meant for you to read and then afterwards occupies a permanent place in your heart due to the special connection you feel with it? Well, for me, Susan Orlean\u2019s \nThe Library Book\n was definitely THAT book (the reasons why will become more clear later on in this review).  I\u2019ve had my nose in a book ever since I learned how to read at 5 or 6 years old (though my mom likes to tell people that I might have well been born with a book in my hands, since I was always attracted to books even as an infant \u2013 my mom said whenever I cried, she would simply put a baby book in my crib and instantly I would stop crying, lol). One of the fondest memories of my childhood was the bi-weekly trip to the local library that my mom would take me on, where I would always check out a huge stack of books (I remember I would always exceed the limit of books that I was allowed to check out on my card so my mom would end up checking out a few of my books on her card), take them home and read them all in less than a week, then beg my mom to take me back to the library again before our regular \u201clibrary day\u201d so I could return that stack of books and check out new ones. My thirst for books and reading were insatiable back in those days and so of course, the library became my \u201ccandy shop\u201d growing up \u2013 it was my \u201cmost favorite place on earth,\u201d a place where I could literally spend the entire day browsing through endless shelves of books, looking at covers, reading summaries on the back and pretty much just delight in being surrounded by books at every turn. As I\u2019m sure was the case with many people, when I reached my teenage years and later, adulthood, and started getting caught up in the never ending \u201cbusyness\u201d of school and work, my relationship with the library changed. I still loved books of course (I don\u2019t think it was a coincidence that I took practically every literature class that my schools had to offer and veered toward a liberal arts degree with a literature emphasis in college) \u2013 but I no longer had the time to go to the library and spend hours on end just \u201changing out\u201d there. Instead of being the place of wonder and excitement that it was in my childhood, the library became \u201cthe place I went for research\u201d or, when I was in college, the place where I would go to work on a paper or a project if I happened to have some free time between classes. Over the years, as \u201ctime\u201d became more and more of a scarcity for me (I\u2019m constantly complaining that 24 hours in a day is not enough for me to finish everything I need/want to get done), the local bookstore(s) eventually replaced the library as my \u201cgo-to\u201d source for books because with the limitations on my time, it was much easier for me to buy a book I needed for my classes way in advance and then just pick it up and start reading at the designated time without having to worry about a due date to return the book or even worse, the book not being available when I needed it. It wasn\u2019t until the last 5 years or so that I got \u201creacquainted\u201d with the library again through my nephew (whom I am proud to say inherited my love for books!) and realized how much I had missed over the years. In the first few chapters of the book, hearing the author recount her relationship with the library \u2013 the trips to the library with her mother as a child, growing apart from the library as an adult, getting reacquainted with the library after going there with her child, etc. -- it reminded me of my own journey, of the up-and-down relationship I\u2019ve also had with libraries over the years. The other reason this book resonated with me so much is because I\u2019ve lived in Los Angeles practically my entire life and so basically \u201cgrew up\u201d in the Los Angeles Public Library system \u2013 though ironically, despite the close proximity, I\u2019ve actually never been to the Central Library in downtown LA (which is where most of the events in the book take place). Regardless though, it was fascinating to learn about the history of the LA library and how the entire system evolved into what it is today. Like the author, I too had no clue about the fire at Central Library back in 1986 (my love for reading obviously didn\u2019t extend to newspapers back then, lol), but even so, I would\u2019ve been too young anyway to understand exactly what was going on. As a history buff, I also enjoyed the historical background about the city of LA and California as a whole that the author incorporated into her narrative. I actually get really excited when I hear things (whether names or places) that I\u2019m familiar with get mentioned in books, as it makes the reading experience that much more personal for me \u2013 in the case of this book, there were actually a few places mentioned where I have friends (or relatives) who live there currently, so it was fun to be able to talk them afterwards about the historical aspects of where they live. In recounting the story of the Central Library fire, Orlean also gives us the story of Harry Peak \u2013 the man largely viewed as responsible for starting the fire but never charged due to lack of evidence. The \u201ctrue crime\u201d aspect of the story -- including the analysis of the various records as well as all the insights into investigation of past arson cases \u2013 was particularly well-done, with the evidence and facts presented in a way that made this as engrossing as reading a good suspense novel. With that said though, this book was so much more than just a chronicle of the Central Library fire or a history of the library\u2019s evolution over the years \u2013 in many respects, this was also an ode to libraries and librarians everywhere as well as a testament to the critical role that libraries play in our society \u2013 not just locally or in our country, but all around the world.  My one small complaint was that the narrative jumped around a bit too much between the investigation, the historical timeline, and Orlean\u2019s personal interactions with various \u201ccharacters\u201d she encounters, whether it was people involved with the original investigation or the librarians she talked with in the course of putting together the research for this book. There were a few times, for example, where the chapter that just finished was about a current interaction at the library but the next chapter was back to the investigation, which was last touched upon several chapters ago, so I had to go back and re-read those sections to refresh my memory on where it had left off. Overall though, this is a minor structural issue in the grand scheme of things of course.  Engaging, insightful, and well-written, this book is a wonderful tribute to not just libraries but also books and book lovers from all walks of life. Highly recommended and a must-read for bibliophiles everywhere! Received ARC from Simon & Schuster via NetGalley ", "The very best books are often the hardest to talk about. 96 of my GR friends reviewed The Library Book. There are 8000+ ratings and over 2000 reviews, with only 3% under 3 stars. Susan Orlean's latest, an ode to the love of libraries, has been favorably reviewed by the best, including Ron Charles for The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Chris Woodyard for USA Today. Perhaps not as gushy were the industry reviews. Still, all in all, positive commentary. So what can I add to the love to encourage you to read The Library Book? Is my recommendation enough?The naysayers had many complaints, the worst of which in my opinion was that if you thought libraries were boring, this proves it. The strongest appeal factors for meLibrary employee (retired), supporter and card carrying bibliophile.True Crime enthusiast.Historical context to broaden my knowledge.Encourage me to conduct my own research, a curiosity to know more.Highlightable passages to savor and contemplate.

Let me leave you with just one paragraph, one that speaks to me as I pursue a new found interest in my ancestors and descendants, and think about my loved ones who have left me behind to face my own mortality. Originally appeared as Growing Up In The Library \u2013 The New Yorker, October 5, 2018 and paraphrased for this book.\u201cThe idea of being forgotten is terrifying. I fear not just that I, personally, will be forgotten but that we are all doomed to being forgotten\u2014that the sum of life is ultimately nothing; that we experience joy and disappointment and aches and delights and loss, make our little mark on the world, and then we vanish, and the mark is erased, and it is as if we never existed. If you gaze into that bleakness even for a moment, the sum of life becomes null and void, because if nothing lasts nothing matters. It means that everything we experience unfolds without a pattern, and life is just a wild, random, baffling occurrence, a scattering of notes with no melody. But if something you learn or observe or imagine can be set down and saved, and if you can see your life reflected in previous lives, and can imagine it reflected in subsequent ones, you can begin to discover order and harmony. You know that you are a part of a larger story that has shape and purpose\u2014a tangible, familiar past and a constantly refreshed future. We are all whispering in a tin can on a string, but we are heard, so we whisper the message into the next tin can and the next string. Writing a book, just like building a library, is an act of sheer defiance. It is a declaration that you believe in the persistence of memory.\u201d", "I REALLY enjoyed this!!A word of warning: this isn't really a true crime book. A lot of the marketing messaging around this sells it as true crime about the arson case surrounding the Los Angeles library fire. If you go into this expecting true crime, you're going to be disappointed. Okay, that said: I loved this.The book focuses on two questions raised by the LA library fire: why does it matter that a library burned down? Why does it matter that this library burned down. The book reads as 40 percent dedicated to the history of the LA library system, 40 percent dedicated to what the LA library (and libraries in general) do today, and only 20 percent focused on the case of the 1986 fire.This is a love letters to libraries. I found the history sections fascinating, but then I love historical nonfiction. The book doubles as an interesting historical look at California itself.But my favorite part of this book by miles was the focus on the modern LA library. Orlean follows various staff, and it was delightful to get these glimpses into the lives of people who seem fundamentally hopeful and incredibly enthusiastic about the work that they do.Orleans writing is lush, if at times her metaphors get a bit redundant. Thoroughly enjoyed this, currently running to my library", "On April 29, 1986, the Los Angeles Central Public Library caught fire and burned for over seven hours. By the time the fire was extinguished, over 400,000 books were destroyed and almost double that number were damaged. This book explores that event but also lays tribute to the history of that library (and others!) and the author\u2019s personal memories of her early library experiences, along with the investigation of what caused the fire. It was thought to be arson and the primary suspect was a man named Harry Peak, an unemployed actor.I\u2019d never heard about this fire (the author posits as to why I not), the largest and worst library fire ever, so naturally I was intrigued by that factoid alone. What I loved about this book was the overwhelming wealth of information about the past librarians, and history of the Central Library; other notable library histories globally and connections to world events; and the evolution of fire investigation and how it related to this event. In a word, it was all fascinating. Each librarian left an indelible imprint on the library, their contribution to a vibrant institution. While the transitions between the topics were often awkward, I enjoyed that there were shifts as it kept things interesting. The weaving of personal stories, colorful librarian histories and the community connections made this something special. I listened to the book, narrated by the author, and though I liked it, I believe I would have loved the book more if I\u2019d read it, giving me a better opportunity to more slowly digest these stories and facts. Orlean did a good job in her reading and I\u2019m not certain a professional narrator would have changed the experience. It\u2019s a lot of wonderful information that I found enlightening but difficult to accept how little I knew about our libraries and the issues they have always faced. If you love books and have any kind of connection to libraries, physical or digital, you really must read this book. It evokes a strong reaction as your personal memories and attachments will also arise and consume you. You\u2019ll have to form your own conclusion, though, regarding whether or not Harry Peak set that library on fire. By the way, I borrowed this from my digital library\ud83e\udd70", "I think I would have loved this book even if I wasn't a librarian. Susan Orlean's latest subject is about a massive fire at the Los Angeles Public Library in April 1986. 400,000 books were destroyed; hundreds of thousands more were damaged. Fortunately, no one was killed. (If you haven't heard of the fire, you're not alone \u2014 it got buried in the news because the Chernobyl disaster happened the same week.) The Library Book is a beautiful object (gorgeous red cover, gold font, dazzling blurbs from other esteemed writers, there's even a mock check-out card on the back cover \u2014 the book looks handsome on a shelf, to be sure), and the story Orlean weaves is also a thing of beauty. Investigators believe they found the person who started the fire, but arson is tricky to prove, as we learn. Like her other charming true-crime-ish book, The Orchid Thief, Orlean comes at the subject sideways, looking not just at the fire, but at the history and nature of libraries and librarians; at the history of fire investigations; at the history of the Los Angeles Public Library and its administrators; and perhaps most movingly, at Orlean's personal memories of libraries and what the mean to her. I loved all of it. Highly recommended.Favorite Quote\"A library is a good place to soften solitude; a place where you feel part of a conversation that has gone on for hundreds and hundreds of years even when you're all alone. The library is a whispering post. You don't need to take a book off a shelf to know there is a voice inside that is waiting to speak to you, and behind that was someone who truly believed that if he or she spoke, someone would listen. It was that affirmation that always amazed me. Even the oddest, most particular book was written with that kind of crazy courage \u2014 the writer's belief that someone would find his or her book important to read. I was struck by how precious and foolish and brave that belief is, and how necessary, and how full of hope it is to collect these books and manuscripts and preserve them. It declares that all these stories matter, and so does every effort to create something that connects us to one another, and to our past and to what is still to come.\"", "The largest library disaster in American history is the furnace at the center of Orlean\u2019s story, which is fueled by regular additions of memoir, biography, history and science. In one particularly sobering chapter, she reminds us, \u201cPeople have been burning libraries for nearly as long as they\u2019ve been building libraries.\u201d The number of books deliberately consigned to the flames is in the billions. \u201cI sometimes find it hard to believe there are any books left in the world.\u201dBut amid such gloom is much light. As a narrator, Orlean moves like fire herself, with a pyrotechnic style that smolders for a time over some ancient bibliographic tragedy, leaps to the latest technique in book restoration and then illuminates the story of a wildly eccentric librarian. Along the way, we learn how libraries have evolved, responded to depressions and wars, and generally thrived despite a constant struggle for funds. Over the holidays, every booklover in America is going to give or get this book.As she did in her 1998 bestseller, \u201cThe Orchid Thief,\u201d Orlean brings us along as she tries to understand the mercurial figure at the center of. . . . .To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert..."], "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Writing", "Books About Books", "Crime", "True Crime"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/61126110-the-library-book", "avg_ratings": "3.93", "ShelvedNumber": "1789"}

What she doesn\u2019t know is that she\u2019s stepping into a nightmare\u2014one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder. Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn\u2019t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn\u2019t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn\u2019t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant. It was everything. She knows she\u2019s made mistakes.

There is no way I can make you listen to my case. So I'm just going to have to do my best to set things out. However long it takes, however much I mess this up, I'm just going to keep going and tell the truth.\"And so begins our tale. I'm sure that, unless you've been walking around with your eyes closed and your ears plugged up, you've caught wind of this upcoming release, but if not let me give you a brief introduction. The Turn of the Key is a compulsive tale of a nanny sitting in jail awaiting trial for the murder of one of her charges. The entire book is told through letters from said nanny to a potential solicitor, recalling the events leading up to her incarceration, along with a few surprise notes at the end. The basic jist of events is that we begin with Rowan answering an advertisement for a nannying position in the Scottish countryside. The catch is that this particular household has been through 4 nannies in less than a year, and the reasons behind this are murkily associated to legends of the estate being haunted. Shenanigans ensue, all hell breaks loose, and much havoc is played out over the course of the book. As someone who has taken time to warm to Ware's novels over the year, I think she's found her niche in the gothic suspense genre. I truly enjoyed Mrs. Westaway, and I believe The Turn of the Key is her best novel yet. The pacing was 100% what I was praying for, and the creepy elements, such as the locked closet, the poison garden, and the smart home with little to no privacy, were all excellent inclusions and flawlessly executed. I found that even the supporting characters, especially Jack and Jean, were just as intriguing as Rowan was. My only complaint was with the ending; it felt like a bit of a let down after such a large build up, and even though it worked, it felt like the easy ending to take. The twists may or may not surprise you; I felt that I had most of them figured out, but there were a few smaller twists that took me completely by surprise, which I wholly appreciated. If you're looking for a creepy, character driven psychological thriller that will keep you thrilled and chilled from beginning to end, definitely add The Turn of the Key to your late summer TBR! *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.", "Four okay I loved it, it freaked me out, gave me enough chills, my all nails are shorter, oh wait a second I don\u2019t have nails anymore and my arms are covered with stress bites, my hair is in the air, you made a great job Ruth Ware, I wanted to clap but my hands are still shaking stars!!!

But more Chardonnay meant lack of concentration. You need to be full alert to enjoy the story.) So it\u2019s great combination of modern and gothic horror materials. There are too many disturbing characters but it worked perfectly with this well-rounded story telling.And the ending: It was nice touch! Every little detail in this book is important so you have to give full attention for great satisfaction! It\u2019s fast pacing, one or two sit reading.

The protagonist, Rowan Caine, stumbles upon an opportunity that she considers amazing and I would consider an absolute nightmare-- a live-in nanny to four children, including one baby and one bratty teenager. On top of this, she's staying in the high-tech Heatherbrae House - a refurbished \"smart\" home with constant surveillance, voice-activated lights, and an app to go with it.Unlike Rowan, I think this sounds like a horror story. And, honestly, I found the book to be at its strongest when it is drawing on creepy horror tropes like creaking footsteps in the attic, objects going missing and reappearing where the MC knows she already looked, and freaky dolls. The atmosphere is quite good and it would make for a somewhat spooky Halloween read. The combination of nightmare children, a malfunctioning house that seems haunted, and the hunky but suspicious handyman kept me reading.I also liked how Ware framed the story within a letter to a solicitor. It worked so well that I'm surprised I haven't read books that have done this before (that I recall).But it just wasn't very strong as a mystery, in my opinion. The culprit can be guessed pretty easily (this really isn't a surprising reveal anymore) and it irked me how it doesn't make sense for Rowan to withhold the identity of the dead child, though of course she does so because once we know who it is, it removes any doubt as to who the killer must be. The author also dropped a lot of heavy-handed hints about (view spoiler)[Rowan not being who she says she is (hide spoiler)] so I even started to work out what was going on there. This part of the story frustrated me, actually, because it kind of changes the whole focus of the book from being about the potential horrors of a nanny living in a \"smart\" house to something else that didn't interest me half as much.The ending felt unfinished, too. I wanted more after becoming invested in the story. I won't rush out to recommend this one, but there are some Halloween-worthy chills to be had here. I'll still check out Ware's future books.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "A nanny in jail accused of murdering one of the children in her care. This is her story. When Rowan, a young nanny who lives in London, comes across for an ad seeking a nanny to live in a remote area of Scotland, it sounds too good to be true. The pay is high, the house is beautiful, and the family seems lovely. She is warned that previous nannies have quit due to the house being haunted. Rowan doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, so she pays no heed to the warning. She is hired for the position and packs up her life in London and moves to remote Scotland. But what is beautiful on the surface is hiding deep dark secrets.One of my favorite things about The Turn of the Key is the house which is named Heatherbrae. Equipped with state of the art technology (the whole house runs off an app), it takes on a life of its own. Juxtaposed with Victorian architecture and Gothic feel, Heatherbrae adds another layer to The Turn of the Key.The Turn of the Key  is told only through Rowan\u2019s eyes, as she shares what led to her arrest through a series of letters to a solicitor. Rowan is an unreliable narrator and the reader must contend with a lot of telling. While this type of narrative style usually irks me, I found that it works in this case as Rowan provides a detailed account of her time at Heatherbrae. One just needs to continue to question whether or not her version of events is accurate.There are some twists as well some red herrings thrown in for good measure. I guessed many of the smaller twists, but I completely missed the most significant twist. And I was looking for it! Sadly, my detective skills failed. This twist added an additional layer and made me want to reread from the beginning. The ending felt a bit rushed and I could have done without the final letter. I would rather have been left guessing than be told a less than satisfying conclusion to Rowan\u2019s story. Overall, this is an atmospheric, slower-paced psychological thriller with some intriguing twists and turns. I received an ARC of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.", "In the beginning of the book, Rowan is writing a letter to Mr. Wexham, begging for him to help her. She tells him that she is innocent of a crime of murder that she did not commit and that she needs his assistance with her trial that is coming up soon. He is a lawyer and she wants him to prove her innocence.There is an old house located in a remote area in the middle of nowhere in the Scottish Highlands. Rowan becomes a nanny for a family of three children in this creepy estate. The house has a haunted past. Other nannies left and the family has a hard time keeping nannies. The house has everything that you can imagine and Rowan is getting paid very well. It is a smart house with different technology and it has creepy noises in the night. Dark and disturbing events happen in this house. The parents leave Rowan alone with their children in this estate. What Rowan doesn't know is that she is stepping into a nightmare. There are cameras installed in the house and she is having a difficult time and she knows that she has made some mistakes. There is something about a Ruth Ware book that makes me excited to read it. I loved The Death of Mrs. Castaway and I knew that I would love this one once I opened the book. This is gothic suspense, a mystery, and a thriller. It is so creepy. I loved the gothic atmosphere and it's elements. The book was quite addicting. It was totally gripping, especially if you like gothic suspense like me. It is so haunting. I didn't see the twists coming and it had a couple of jaw dropping moments and I loved them. I kept guessing till the very end. I thought the characters were developed well and it was very well written. The ending was so surprising. This was a Traveling Sister read. I want to thank Edelweiss, Simon & Schuster and Ruth Ware for the ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.Available Now", "Creepy, suspenseful, & mysterious!THE TURN OF THE KEY by RUTH WARE is a compelling, dark, twisted, and haunting mystery thriller that immediately sucked me in and had me totally absorbed within this tale.Right from the very start there is this intense sense of foreboding that definitely makes this quite the gripping book to read.....it is a slow-burn and the intensity level slowly increases as the story progresses. I absolutely loved the creepy modern gothic vibe going on here and RUTH WARE definitely knows how to deliver an atmospheric, vivid, and hair-raising suspenseful novel that I found to be quite appealing, enjoyable and entertaining.My only real gripe here that I have though is that I don't always feel that she follows through with some aspects to the storyline. Not sure if she knowingly doesn't follow through with some things or if it is part of her signature technique to be a little bit vague. I've noticed this style of writing in almost all of her books and sometimes it has bothered me and others not so much. This one it didn't bother me as much.I absolutely loved the format of this novel which was written in an epistolary format (letters). The tone was set right at the very beginning and I thought it followed through right to the very end. I also thought RUTH WARE did a fabulous job with the creepy sounds and the ominous atmosphere with the setting of Heatherbrae House. I was a little bit freaked out and scared which definitely left me a little on edge while I was reading certain scenes. Norma\u2019s Stats:Cover: Intriguing, ghostly, suspenseful, ominous and an extremely fitting representation to storyline. I have an absolute love for Ruth Ware cover designs!Title: I was immediately intrigued by the title of this book and definitely enticed me to read this book. Writing/Prose: Haunting, engaging, vividly descriptive, and readable.Plot: Suspenseful, appealing, eerie, menacing, gripping, perfectly-paced, absorbing, ominous, enjoyable and entertaining.Ending: A cryptic and satisfying resolution. Overall: I was immediately interested in this tale and thoroughly enjoyed the unraveling of the mystery, the characters and the storyline. So far this is my favourite book by Ruth Ware! Would highly recommend!Thank you so much to Simon & Schuster Canada and Ruth Ware for gifting me an advance copy of this book.This review can also be found on our Two Sisters Lost in a Coulee Reading book blog:https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/2...", "This is Ruth Ware's latest offering, a chiller of a psychological thriller with its central protagonist, 24 year old Rowan Caine working in childcare in London. She is looking for another post when she come across an incredible job as a live in Nanny for the Elincourt family, the parents Bill and Sandra are architects, living in the remote Scottish Highlands, and the pay for the post is unbelievable. If there is one thing you should beware of, it is that if a job sounds to be too good to be true, then it is, something Rowan is to discover to her cost. At her weekend interview, young Maddie warns Rowan to not take the job, and it seems other nannies employed have left abruptly. The Elincourts have four children from 18 months to 14 years old, a heavy burden of responsibility for Rowan, especially as she is left almost immediately as their sole carer with the parents travelling so often, and it is no exaggeration to say that they are a real handful.Heatherbrae House itself is a jarring blend of Victorian with all the tech that makes it a smart home, with cameras everywhere and a handy man, Jack, is employed. Strange and eerie happenings create a creepy, menacing and ghostly atmosphere within Heatherbrae, and a litany of incidents culminate in the murder of a child. Rowan is languishing in prison awaiting her trial for the murder, concerned with her legal representation, and writing a letter to a solicitor, Mr Wrexham, proclaiming her innocence of the crime she has been charged with and laying out the circumstances which have led to her present ghastly predicament. She admits to not always being the perfect nanny and true to form with this genre, she is an unreliable narrator and the characters are almost universally dislikeable. This is an intense story of many twists, small and big, slow in pace, and where you are going to have to suspend your sense of disbelief on occasion. The premise of the novel held my interest, although this is far from my favourite Ware book. Many thanks to Random House Vintage for an ARC.", "\nI had low expectations for this because I had heard such mixed things about Ruth Ware, but this was SO GOOD. It took so many of the classic thriller components but made them feel fresh and new and I'm a big fan.

Ware is back on track in this tense tale of suspense!! I have loved Ruth Ware since I read \u2018In a Dark, Dark Wood\u2019, yet, I really struggled with her previous book. I didn\u2019t lose my confidence in Ware, however, and eagerly jumped into this, her latest effort, with gusto- and I was not disappointed!! As the story opens it becomes clear that Rowan Caine, a former nanny, is sitting in prison accused of having killed a child in her care. Through the letters Rowan has written to a prospective attorney, she explains how she came to be there, taking us all the way back to the moment she answered a classified ad for what Rowan would consider a dream job in her chosen field of childcare. Rowan seems thrilled to be considered for such a great opportunity and is genuinely nervous and excited when she is given the job. The technologically advanced smart home Rowan gets to live in is fancy and modern, especially the state of the art kitchen, but the enormous venom thrown at her by one of her charges, coupled with a host of strange noises and occurrences, keeps Rowan on edge day and night, turning her dream job into the stuff nightmares are made of\u2026 I think Ware\u2019s most prominent asset, is her ability to quickly create a mood or atmosphere which sneakily draws readers into her well-constructed web. Once ensnared readers soon find themselves trapped, unable to escape until the very last sentence of the book has been read. This story is hypnotizing, and Ware kept me off guard from start to finish\u2026. And what a finish!! While I had some suspicions, I was mostly caught off guard by the twists and although the ending is a bit ambiguous, I liked it!! I have my own theories, and others will have theirs, making this a fun book to discuss, debate and dissect.  The author is gifted at dropping clues and hiding little Easter eggs within the story, but I was so distracted by the mind games I didn\u2019t pick up on them until after I\u2019d finished reading the book.  Very, very sneaky and clever of Ms. Ware! Well done! I thoroughly enjoyed this one and of course am eagerly anticipating her next release!", "i absolutely despised ruth wares 'the woman in cabin 10' and completely swore her off as an author because of it. so no one is more surprised than me that i enjoyed this, let alone picked it up. you guys seriously have some major persuasive talent going, because its your good reviews that got me to give RW a second chance.i think the unique formatting is a tremendous asset to the story. told through letters written by rowan to a potential solicitor as she sits in prison, the story is a last minute effort to plead her innocence. it feels as if rowan is not only trying to convince the lawyer to take her side, but also the reader. and i liked that. it made me feel more invested in what rowan has to say. i will admit that there are some slow parts and the ending didnt really make me gasp in surprise like i thought it would, but still, this is highly entertaining and i was 100% focused the entire book. not sure RW is off my blacklist yet, as im still unconvinced that liking this book wasnt a total fluke, but i may be willing to put her on probation for the time being. lol.\u21a0 4 stars", "i\u2019ve heard a lot of mixed things about ruth ware in the past, but honestly this was pretty solid. maybe it\u2019s time i try more of her books lol. ", "Gothic, creepy, a house with a hideous history...OMG yes please!! This was hands down my favorite book by Ruth Ware! All the stars for this one! I have read all her books except The Death of Mrs. Westaway (which is sitting here in my bookcase waiting to be read). Up until this point In a Dark Dark Wood was my favorite, but wow oh wow I loved this book.Four nannies in a year, umm okay people that should be a sign that there are some real problems at the Heatherbrae House. Granted the house has an extensive history, I mean don't all old homes? That is what Rowan told herself when she applied for the job. Okay Rowan, you just keep telling yourself that. Drawn in by the generous salary and the gorgeous home she decided to roll the dice and try out the job, even with the history of previous nannies not being able to cut it. Were the the rumors true that the house was haunted? Is that what caused them to leave so quickly? Or was it the somewhat difficult children that they were entrusted to? I began to wonder if it was Sandra and Bill Elincourt whom appeared to be a bit challenging to deal with in themselves.I tell you what, there is no way I would have spent numerous nights in this house like Rowan did. I was completely creeped out as nightfall hit each evening. Things were happening and they appeared to be supernatural. Given the history of this home, there is no doubt that is what would be running through my mind if I were staying there. Add to it this \"smart house\" with all the amazing, yet creepy features. That would drive me mad in itself. If I were Rowan I would be concerned that my employers were watching my every move, meaning that someone else could be too.I have read some reviews that said this was a slow start or slow moving book but not for me! I was sucked in from the very first page. This was a really fast pace for me and I couldn't put it down. I read this late into the night. I am really looking forward to what Ware is going to come up with next. I read this with a group of fellow Traveling Sisters! It made for a fantastic group read.Thank you so much to Gallery/Scout Press for this ARC I received via Edelweiss. I LOVED it!! Thanks you to Ruth Ware for another fantastic book!Merged review:", "This was a group read/listen that I\u2019m really glad I participated in. This novel was on my TBR, but I don\u2019t know if I would have gotten to it as quickly if it hadn\u2019t been selected for the January group read. The story pulled me in right from the start. Ruth Ware sure knows how to create an atmosphere. I thought the narration was great (except that *creep creeeeep* noise really started to get to me). The storyline was intriguing and there were some great twists that I didn\u2019t see coming (especially the ending!) I did feel that a few things were left unfinished but overall, I really liked how it came together in the end. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to more from Ruth Ware!", "DisconcertingTurn of the Key is an unnerving story told by a murder suspect as she recounts the background and incidents leading to the death of a child while she was its nanny. Rowan Caine is the nanny and she is writing the story in the form of a letter to a solicitor, Mr Wrexham, requesting his services to defend her. Within the story, there are periodic passages where she speaks directly to Mr Wrexham outlining how her story may be considered and continuously stating her innocence, no matter how the evidence looks. As a technique, it was used to remind the reader that this is only one account and perhaps a very unbalanced and disconcerting version, but I felt it slightly distracting on more than one occasion.Rowan applies for the nanny position with Sandra and Bill Elincourt, and their 4 daughters ranging from 18 months to 14 years old. The family live in a remote part of Scotland in a house that jolts between new and old. The Victorian architecture of the building clashes abruptly with the high-tech sensor and communication technology that controls features throughout the house. Door access, lighting, heating, curtains, music and room-to-room communications all offer an opportunity to mix faulty operation, malicious intent and/or paranormal interference. Before Rowan has even taken up the position, young Maddie warns her not to come as the \u201cGhosts wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d There is a theme of uncertainty littered throughout the story, from the reliability of the accused\u2019s narration to the contrary characters and the split personality of the house itself. Everything that happens is projected through the house and so many nannies have previously left feeling threatened as the house could be harbouring something sinister. With so many flawed characters it often adds to more realistic personalities and relationships, but in this case, I found it difficult to empathise and connect with any character as their personalities were all disagreeable and distant.Sandra and Bill are partners in their own architectural business and constantly travel. In fact, they first leave Rowan alone with the children only 2 days after she starts. Rowan has at best embellished her CV and feels the struggle to maintain the professional image she created and wrestles with bubbling anger that threatens to spill over into how she deals with the children, especially as they continuously test her resolve. \n \u201cI hate you too! I wanted to scream after their retreating backs, as they padded quietly away into the media room to fire up Netflix. I hate you too, you vile, creepy little shits!\u201d \n The plot sets up various possible routes and each offers equal plausibility and opportunity. There is a final twist that I didn\u2019t expect and that deserves a lot of credit as it wasn\u2019t even on my radar.The Victorian Smart house, mixed with a dark history, provides a unique canvas to play out a family constantly in flux as nannies are forced to leave until one nanny puts up a battle and a child dies. I felt the pace of the book was slow but the main disappointment was that the characters didn\u2019t cry out to be championed. I would rate 3.5 stars but still recommend the book and I\u2019d like to thank Gallery/Scout Press and NetGalley for providing me with an ARC copy in return for an honest review.", "\nThe new nanny, Rowan Caine,\n has\n her hands full at Heatherbrae House.\nThis was my fourth novel by the author and I had to see how this one would compare.I've read several \"nanny\" stories and find myself drawn to the whole idea of having someone live in your home and act as a child minder. Rowan gets this \"dream\" nanny job and finds out that the last several nannies\u00a0didn't work out.The house was probably my favorite aspect of the story. It was renovated to be a \"smart\" home and the owners could spy on all the goings on, turn lights on/off and even ask it to launch an audio book for the children. I kept thinking\u00a0Alexa\u00a0controls the day ( no thank you!)\u00a0 Really creepy vibes for sure.The build-up was quite slow and I wanted more showing than telling and some better developed characters.

I\u2019m so annoyed that this was such a flop.", "In The Turn of the Key, Rowan comes across an ad looking for a live-in nanny at a remote country estate. When she applies and gets the job, she is thrilled. But it seems the opportunity is too good to be true, and soon she realizes there are malevolent forces at work inside the idyllic house. The story is told with the reveal first, as a child is dead and Rowan is sitting in prison writing to her lawyer pleading that she did not kill the child. She then proceeds to tell him the story of what really happened.And here is my first issue with this story: Rowan spends a good amount of time in the initial chapters telling her lawyer (and us) how important it is that he hears the whole story, every little detail, in order to understand her side. But the truth isn't that complicated and can be summed up in a few sentences. Yet she keeps going on about how he can't possibly understand everything if she left anything out. This style of foreshadowing is a pretty common tactic used by modern authors writing thrillers, and it drives me crazy. If the only way to achieve suspense is to tell your readers repeatedly that the good part is coming, maybe your story isn't that suspenseful?Rowan also isn't particularly likable or relatable as a character. She exercises poor judgement over and over again. For example, who would jump into a job that four people had previously vacated in just one year? To any thinking person, this would raise red flags and they would proceed with caution, but she didn't even ask any questions. As odd things start happening, she could have reached out to the parents or another adult, but she doesn't, fearing that others would view her as hysterical. She comes across as very melodramatic and silly, and therefore works herself into a bad situation.The majority of this story is Rowan trying to get the nanny job (100 pages), and then watching misbehaving children while smart technology around the house also misbehaves (another 170 pages). It wasn't until the last 60 pages that the book got somewhere. I just didn't find reading page after page of bratty children acting out to be that interesting nor malfunctioning smart technology to be that scary. When we finally get to the unraveling of the mystery, the twists are fairly unimaginative and straightforward. And the ending was rushed and incomplete, and it left a whole bunch of things unexplained.This is my third Ruth Ware book, and they've all been fairly disappointing. The premises seem intriguing, and the mysteries themselves have a lot of potential. But the way they are written, and in particular how stupid and self-defeating the female characters act make the stories real downers. I keep hanging on, hoping the author would mature and work out some of these story-telling tics, but it hasn't happened yet.", "not gonna lie, I kinda hated it. It's just that I struggled to finish it, because it was uninteresting, at least for me. I waited and waited for the part that would freak me out but it didn't come at all. And the twist, well kind of surprising, but it just didn't lead the story anywhere. It was like, here's the twist, do whatever you want with that info. I am quite inexperienced with thrillers, maybe this is how they usually go, however I was not pleased with this. The audiobook was quite well made, I'll give you that, because I don't think I would have finished it in paper form. I fell asleep while reading 2 nights in a row. Thrillers? Aren't they supposed to keep you awake from the thrill?", "A child is dead and a nanny is in prison while her trial is pending. This novel consists of a letter she is writing to a lawyer explaining her innocence of the murder and how she wound up incarcerated. The thing is she is not entirely blameless. One thing is certain: \u201cif it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.\u201d", "\nHaving loved Ruth Ware's previous books I was looking forward to this one with great anticipation. I was greatly disappointed however. There's build up, and build up, and more build up. Then we get to the crunch and it's over in a few pages.

It's the opportunity she'd been waiting for.But mere months later she\u2019s sitting on remand in a Scottish prison, accused of killing one of the children in her charge. Furiously scribbling letters to a top advocate (barrister under British law), she pleads with him to take her case.\n\u2018\u201dI didn't kill that child. Which means someone else did. And they are out there. While I'm in here, rotting.\u201d\u2019\nThis was definitely the right book for me. As a former sole-charge nanny (both live-in and live-out), and in more recent years, regular pet-sitter, house-sitter, I've spent a significant amount of time in other people's houses, largely with only children and/or pets for company, so I found the subject matter in this book hugely relatable. I could feel Rowan's frustration as she struggled to grasp the smart house's various control panels, apps, and features, and as someone who once stayed in a property where during a nighttime power cut all the doors unlocked, because the battery on the back-up generator died, I know the feeling of being in a strange house with malfunctioning technology, and not being entirely sure what to do. Rowan's first day, the two older children disappear on her, playing/hiding in the expansive grounds, and she's frantically searching for them while trying to juggle a fretful baby. Again, I've totally been there, more than once. There were many other instances I could mention, but I've bored you enough with details of my life.However, even though I enjoyed the day-to-day routine of Rowan settling into her nanny position, I'm not entirely certain other readers will feel the same way. And a large portion of the book was devoted to this. It's a slow burn, alright! But, the more I think on it, the more convinced I am that I would've enjoyed it regardless, as you get to experience exactly what Rowan went through from the moment she arrived until the tragic end. You get to know the lay of the land so to speak, and feel Rowan's mounting uncertainty and fear, her slow realisation that something\u2019s not right with the place.Strange occurrences in the night \u2013 creaking, footsteps, cold spots, missing keys, etc \u2013 beginning the moment Rowan arrived, also assisted in moving the plot forward, and upping the creepy ante. Technology played a big part in the \u2018hautings' making this a bit different from usual. The house itself was part restored Victorian/modern architecture which I found as unsettling as Rowan did. The wild, overgrown, neglected gardens, so different from the interior, heightened this feeling. Being an old house it did of course have an ominous history, and was rumored to be haunted, which as some of you know are two of my favourite gothic elements. The four children (aged 14, 8, 5, and 1) had complex, age appropriate personalities and behaviours. Ruth Ware even included Scottish dialogue, which I thought was a nice touch. Even though the entire book was written as a series of letters, it quickly morphed into present tense, with the protagonist occasionally pausing to address the recipient. I for one was grateful for this, as I wasn't fond of the beginning letter format as it was all \u2018tell' and no \u2018show\u2019. It was an original set-up though, and the way it all came together in the end cemented this novel's 5 star rating for me.My favourite Ruth Ware crime/mystery by far.I'd like to thank Netgalley, Random House UK \u2013 Vintage Publishing, and Ruth Ware for the e-ARC.US Release Date: 6th August, 2019.UK Release Date: 8th August, 2019.", "This was a very compelling murder mystery with an interesting narrative perspective (letter to an attorney) and a very shadowy main character (Rowan).

At the new job the children are terrible and she is frightened by uncanny noises in the attic. The complete house is computer controlled. Then the girls lead her to a poisenous garden with dangerous flowers on the property where a former owner cultivated his hobby. Well, the whole house hasn't the best reputation in the small village. Who is Rowan Caine and why did she really apply for the job there? When a murder happens things turn twisty and extremely exciting. The author did an absolute stunning murder mystery here in the best Hitchcock tradition. You have all the ingredients needed and the book keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Ruth Ware, often referred to as the Agatha Christie of our time, has penned her best yet. Rowan, a child-care worker, unexpectedly comes across an online ad for a nanny position in Scotland. It's one of those opportunities that seems too good to be true: a job taking care of children in a high-tech mansion in the Scottish Highlands with an income that can't be matched. To her surprise, Rowan gets the position to care for four young girls, from toddler to teen. Before long, one of the children is killed and Rowan is imprisoned, charged with murder. What happened in such a short time? In a letter written to a lawyer she hopes will defend her, she explains that the children she had met at the interview were not well-behaved, as she had been led to believe. The large house was monitored with cameras in every corner, with speakers turning on and off, day and night. She could not trust the estate handyman, the only other adult on site. And Rowan was left alone with the children during her first days there. The novel proceeds at a slow pace, with new clues dispersed here and there, leaving the reader wanting more. This is a novel for all mystery readers, especially those who want a little cringing with their reading.

The story is unfolded in the form of letters written by Rowan Caine while she is in prison and addressed to a potential solicitor, narrating the events that led to her incarceration. Rowan is accused of murdering a child she was looking after and is resolved on unraveling her unspeakable truth that will set her free.This book was so enthralling and riveting that it instilled an ineffable sense of trepidation in me and made my heart beat fast in my chest. Given that I read this at night, alone in the house, the ceaseless sounds of doors squeaking, windows creaking and footsteps silently pacing in the attic made my heart palpitate with fear. The state-of-the-art Heatherbrae House which was equipped with surveillance cameras and ran on an app took on a life of its own and became a 'character' haunting the protagonist. The atmospheric ambiance of the book set the scene for unfathomable, inscrutable things happening and wreaked havoc.Rowan was an unreliable narrator since she made a secret of her identity and was not completely to be relied on. There was a number of plot twists I could not have possibly seen coming. The only thing that vexed me about this book was the anticlimactic ending. So much effort was made to build up mystery and raise a baffling conundrum only to come to such an underwhelming ending. I would also like to know whether or not those letters saw the light of day and extenuated Rowan's case.If you are a fan of suspenseful thrillers and enigmatic riddles this book may be worth reading.", "\noooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for BEST MYSTERY/THRILLER 2019! what will happen?i have reviewed this for l.a. review of books, scheduled to run 8/20.TODAY IS 8/20!! review is posted here!!!come to my blog!\n", "4.5 starsOut of the four Ruth Ware novels I have read (still need to get to The Lying Game), this one is my favorite. While I liked her other books, either my interest would wane a bit and/or I had an idea or two about the ending. With this book, my eyes were practically glued to the pages because I really had no clue where the author was going to go with the story. This was a fun read for me which is all I really wanted when I picked up the book.A nanny is in prison awaiting trial for murder. She knows she has made mistakes but she did not kill that child. She is concerned her current lawyer doesn't believe her so she begins writing letters to another attorney, Mr. Wrexham, with the hope he will see she is innocent of the crime. She explains how she got the job as nanny to the family living in Heatherbrae House, and how everything went so horribly wrong. If she tells the truth, the whole truth, will Mr. Wrexham believe her? Will anyone?From the get go you know someone has been murdered and over the course of the story it is slowly revealed everything that led up to it. The house is basically a character itself and really contributes quite nicely to this creepy, horror style vibe. I loved how the technology features of the home actually made me tense and allowed me to really feel like I was in the main character's shoes. This was one of those rare times I didn't even have a decent theory floating around in my head about what was going on and that just made reading all the more fun. It's like I could just sit back and enjoy the ride. Now when it comes to the big reveal or whatever you might call it, I would not say I found it extremely disappointing, more like it wasn't 100% satisfying. I feel like there was so much build up to the moment and I needed more as in some ways it felt anti-climatic. Overall though this was a great read for me and I highly recommend checking this one out especially if you have enjoyed other books by the author.Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with an advance digital copy in exchange for an honest review!"], "genre": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Audiobook", "Suspense"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/62793178-the-turn-of-the-key", "avg_ratings": "3.95", "ShelvedNumber": "1766"}

Among them is Jacquie Red Feather, newly sober and trying to make it back to the family she left behind. Dene Oxendene, pulling his life together after his uncle's death and working at the powwow to honor his memory. Fourteen-year-old Orvil, coming to perform traditional dance for the very first time. Together, this chorus of voices tells of the plight of the urban Native American--grappling with a complex and painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and spirituality, with communion and sacrifice and heroism. Hailed as an instant classic, There There is at once poignant and unflinching, utterly contemporary and truly unforgettable.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1512071034l/36692478.jpg", "title": "There There", "authors": "Tommy Orange", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36692478-there-there", "reviews": ["\n\"Don't ever let anyone tell you what being Indian means. Too many of us died to get just a little bit of us here, right now, right in this kitchen.\"\nOrange's ambitious debut captures the experience of modern \"urban Indians\" through constantly shifting third person perspectives, ultimately showing that Native Americans are not a monolith, not a stereotype, not united under a single identity. The author takes a number of risks, and yet they all work to create a book of such extreme power that it's hard to come away from it unchanged.There There is much-needed and important, but I kind of hate saying that. There seems to be some underlying implication in those words that the book has been hyped due to it's sociopolitical importance, and that's just not the case. Orange's characters are vivid and complex. He has somehow written a book where every chapter is from a different point of view and yet every single character's voice is unique and engaging.The characters and stories here are not the stereotypes most non-native Americans are familiar with. It's not about reservations or the old stories, but about the struggles of modern Indians in the inner cities. Struggles with identity, community, substance addictions and poverty. It is so easy to think of Native Americans as a stereotype, as a cartoon character with feathers in their hair, but of course, the truth is so much more complicated.It is difficult to survive in a modern society that has been defined by white Europeans, whilst also trying to maintain something of the culture that those white Europeans worked to erase. Through personalities that come to life on the page, Orange explores the many facets of being Native American today. From Jacquie Red Feather, whose existence is a constant battle against alcoholism, to the mixed race Edwin Black who has never met his Native father.What is noticeable about There There is how this thoughtful literary novel is extremely accessible. The author's writing is a pleasure to read-- compelling, conversational, but no less powerful because of it.Orange sets these stories of everyday people and lives alongside his own voice in the harrowing prologue and interlude. He takes these brief moments to write about the history of Native Americans - how treaties became murder and betrayal - and provide information about the Native culture, such as the details of pow wows. I somewhat knew the history already and yet a reminder can be a valuable thing; listening to this man of Native descent describe how his ancestors were tricked and brutally murdered is a chilling experience, and one all non-natives should have.A brutal, insightful novel, with a sea of memorable characters. Each one very different, and yet all connected.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "This is an ambitious novel told in stories about different Indians in Oakland whose lives converge at a Pow Wow. It took me a long time to get into the novel. When the threads start to come together the novel picks up. There is some great writing throughout. But still... something is missing here. Something isn\u2019t quite working for me. But the ambition and the last lines do a lot to elevate this. Look forward to seeing more from the author. ", "Update: I\u2019m very happy to learn that Tommy Orange won the PEN/Hemingway award!!!Congrats!!!n\u201dThere There\u201d is an outstanding novel. Update: Terrific pick!!!! 2018 National Book Award Longlist.... Fiction!!5+++++ stars!!!!! Absolutely phenomenal!!!!!\u201cThere There\u201d is a non-stop pace story... COULD NOT PUT THIS DOWN....The stories in here are gut wrenching *intimate* about dislocation-identify-violence -loss-hope-and power.  \u201cWe have been defined by everyone else and continue to be slandered despite easy-to-look-up-Internet-facts about realities of our histories and current state as a people\u201d. The despair and beauty in Tommy Orange\u2019s debut novel entwined the history of a nation and indigenous community in Oakland, Calif. Incredible characters.Dialogue with feelings.Warmth, pride, sediments for Oakland-raised Tommy Orange! Congratulations to him!!!He knocked the ball out of the park with this outstanding novel!!!!", "Tommy Orange's debut novel is already getting a lot of love, but I have to chime in with my praise, too. For one thing, There, There is set in Oakland, where I lived for most of the 90s, and reading it brought back a lot of memories. The author hits us with a buckshot blast of wonderful characters, self-described \"Urban Indians,\" each with his/her own short, interwoven chapters. We follow their interconnected lives as they prepare for the first Big Oakland Pow Wow. They are drawn there for many different reasons -- to reconnect, to make money, to dance, to record stories. Unfortunately, a few of them are planning to rob the Pow Wow. Orange provides deft, beautifully crafted portraits of their lives, so by the time the hold-up come and (SPOILER) the heist does not go as planned, we care about how all of them will fare. The ending is perfect -- unfinished, jagged with emotion, and yet still full of perseverance and hope. I won't say this read was 'easy.' It packs an emotional wallop. But the pages fly by, thanks to the short chapters and varying points of view.", "I have no idea how to rate this book. Things about it enthralled me and other parts just fell flat. This book started off so strong. The writing in the prologue just grabbed me. I was convinced I was going to love the book. But once the chapters begin, I started to have problems.You are introduced to 12 characters, each given their own chapter, and initially, I thought the book was a series of short stories. I think the sheer number of \u201cmain characters\u201d and all their various stories and viewpoints was a large part of my problem. You\u2019re half way through the book before any of them begin to interact. Also, there are timing differences which don\u2019t get explained or even alluded to in chapter headings. It soon becomes clear that the timing is different, but it just added to my aggravation. Was I expected to have known the takeover of Alcatraz by the Indians was in 1969? I understood what the author was attempting and that a large number of characters was needed to truly show the variety of the urban Indian experience. And he covers all the ugly aspects - the alcoholism and fetal alcohol syndrome, the drugs, the loss of parents, raising your \u201cgrandchildren\u201d. He also does a great job of discussing the feeling of \u201cotherness\u201d and trying to find your history or your culture. One thing this book has made me realize is that while great writing and interesting characters are important, story is key to my enjoyment of a book. I read this for my book club and I\u2019m really curious to see how the others enjoyed this and what kind of discussion it generates. In the end, I\u2019m wimping out and assigning this 3.5 stars, rounding down not up. ", "Before I even finished reading this, I began hoping that Tommy Orange was already working on his next book. Beautifully written, creatively and skillfully structured with the stories of multiple characters, each one important and affecting on their own, but when meshed with connections that unfold I was blown away. For a short time these narratives seem like individual stories until one by one the characters become connected and their collective story is brutal, honest and sad and powerful. It will be at the Powwow in Oakland that family will be reunited with family, that some of them will face their demons, and some of them will find out who they are, and most of them become part of the tragedy that takes place there. The description had me thinking I\u2019d be reading about Native Americans of the present day, the urban Indian and that\u2019s true BUT don\u2019t think for a minute that Tommy Orange is going to be gentle with you and allow you to ignore the past. The Prologue - Indian Heads, massacres, snippets of history that filled me with sorrow, with a feeling of complicit guilt. He\u2019s not gentle with the reader in the present either, he is honest. There is alcoholism and there are drugs, and suicide and questions of identity and family that lead to tragedies. Yet, in the midst of all of this we can find love through one of my favorite characters Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield. We find hope in Orvil Red Feather who just wants to go to the Powwow to dance, to be a part of his past, of which he knows little about. In Jacquie Red Feather, there is the wish for redemption. I loved that Dene Oxendene carries out his uncles dream of filming native Americans telling their stories. I loved that Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield\u2019s mother tells her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t ever not tell our stories.\u201d I love that Tommy Orange took that advice. He educates us. I must have lived under a rock as I had never heard of the occupation of Alcatraz island by Indians of All Tribes in 1969 - 1971 and I had never the term urban Indian. This is a profound book, one that I hope will win awards. ", "Tommy Orange\u2019s There There is, hands down, my favourite novel of the year (2018) thus far.*If you came here looking for a scale-tipping review, look no further. In fact, imagine me clearing off any weight on the opposing side and planting my considerable heft on the side favoring your reading of this novel. If you\u2019ve ever picked up a book because of my reviews, then trust me: this is one you\u2019re going to want in your hands posthaste. There There is a novel we\u2019ll be seeing crop up on best-of and award shortlists later this year and you\u2019d be remiss to miss out on Tommy Orange\u2019s impressive debut. As a matter of fact, the less you know about this book, the better. I'm not going to spoil the novel, but the true enjoyment comes from the unveiling of the 12 diverse voices that make up the cast of There There, anyways. Each character seems as if they could carry their own novel on voice alone. Be it humor, pathos, despair, joy, shame, or a yearning for lost culture, Tommy Orange managed to etch each character\u2019s specific voice into my mind like names written in unset concrete. Their voices are powerful, resonant, and made the book\u2019s reading compulsive. To Orange\u2019s credit, these diverse characters begin to become linked over the course of this story\u2019s telling. As the Big Oakland Powwow looms ever closer, Orange begins to reel in threads you hadn\u2019t realized were part of the same netting. I found myself blown away by the first few instances of familial or passing connection. I\u2019d flip back to previous chapters as the time-hopping chapters began to nestle into a tight narrative that reflected the novel\u2019s overarching themes. You wouldn\u2019t be remiss if you\u2019re thinking of Diaz, Mitchell, or Chabon.Orange handles the Native American struggle in Oakland with a complexity that displays an incredible amount of thought, anguish, and introspection. Orange tackles the loss of Native American culture to colonialism in the same chapter that presents a forward-looking approach to cultural identity. The ideas here seem well-trod, complex, and offer no easy answers to the reader. Indeed, the multiperspectivity of the novel allows for a dialogue between the chapters that doesn\u2019t always happen between the characters. By the novel\u2019s end, I was left conflicted and unsure, but happy to have questions with which to wrestle. Yet, this book is not one that is excessively heady or philosophical. In the book\u2019s opening chapters a suggestively white, 3D-printed handgun arrives as if to announce: this is both the story you have heard and one you\u2019ve never read before. As it happens, part of the book\u2019s enduring charm is that it is paced like a thriller. There is violence, heartbreak, and boundless emotion waiting on every page. As the chronally-expansive timeline begins to be tied closer together, it is impossible to avert your attention from the bombastic climax Orange has so carefully laid out.I\u2019m writing this review from an airport bar, but I finished the book a bit over a day ago. As I walked through the terminal, waiting for my flight number to be called, I puttered my way through the quasi-bookstore offerings. Across the three, or maybe four, stores, There There was displayed prominently. It was a heartwarming sight: this is a book that I\u2019m sure many people will love, but even more will benefit from having had read. It\u2019s a novel that invites you to expand your empathy, to rethink conventional thought, and to immerse yourself in the mindsets of a cast of characters who are both like and unlike you. The book is powerful, pulse-pounding, harrowing, eye-opening, and, most-importantly, fresh. This is Orange\u2019s first novel, and you have to wonder what else the man has in his back pocket. This book is so expansive, so filled with beautiful voices and unique writing styles that the mind reels at what Orange could have possibly held back. Perhaps this novel is so powerful because he gave it all he had, because so little was left gestating in the back of his mind. This is the debut of an amazing and essential voice on the American literature scene. There There is a novel that is both a scream and a serenade. There There is a book that is going to stick with me for years to come.*Though I've read some novels since There There that have come close!", " Any novel that highlights or educates it's readers about a time in history where there was mistreatment of people due to their race religion or beliefs is always worth reading and this book is one of those books. However I am not judging the book on its importance but on how it came across and affected me and unfortunately from page one I didn't connect or engage with either the story or the characters.There There tells the story of twelve characters, Urban Indians living in Oakland, California, who converge and collide on one fateful day. Each of these characters have private reasons for traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow. The structure of the book didn't work for me and I failed to connect with the stories or the characters as there were so many of them. It lacked the character development I needed to engage or hold my attention.I listened to this one on audio and perhaps that was a mistake as I find a book with so many characters and their stories is difficult to follow on audio and perhaps this would work better in hard copy.The great thing about reading and books is that  One Man's Pleasure is another man's pain And indeed while this was only a 2 star read for me, this may well be your 5 star read.An ok read for me but certainly not one for my favourite list.", "A collection of interrelated stories set in Oakland, California, There There charts the inner lives of twelve Native Americans as they prepare for the impending Big Oakland Powwow. Orange hops from perspective to perspective, weaving together past and present and exploring what life in Oakland means to each Native character. The best of the chapters are highly affecting, and infuse great storytelling with political purpose; they are fast moving and full of well-drawn characters. The book unfortunately declines in quality when, near the middle of the plot, Orange tries to overlap his characters' disparate lives. The technique feels contrived, and the lurid ending comes across as a copout, a way for Orange to end all his storylines without having resolved any of their conflicts.", "Dene Oxedene, putting his life back together after his uncle's death, wins a grant, allowing him to video stories from those attending the Oakland Pow Wow. In alternating voices we follow the lives and stories of twelve different characters, many who have fallen on hard times of one kind or another. So in a way, these are connected, though the same people appear more than once, short episodes in the lives of those who have lost touch with their culture. This is in most cases through no fault of their own, but it is clear that this loss of culture has caused them to never feel as if they belong, even in their own country. Fractured selves.The urban Indian in Oakland, is the focus here. Something I never knew about, so another difficult learning situation. A terrific debut novel, told in an angry, raw tone, these stories, these lives are full of anguish, pain and yes love. All are heading to the Pow Wow in Oakland, but for different reasons. One young boy wants to dance, his native dance though he knows little about his culture. He hopes to find acceptance and a sense of belonging. Others are heading there for different reasons, and the closer it gets the more the tension is ratcheted higher. Tommy Ornge is a bright new talent for sure, but even more so he opens the readers eyes to issues of which like me, they are not aware. That is a good and powerful thing.

He had a lot of characters to introduce and several stories to tell. He had ideas, but he wasn\u2019t able to effectively put them down on paper. There There just isn\u2019t written very well. It\u2019s pretty sloppy. It takes concepts other authors have pulled off in the past, throws them all out there together and hopes for the best. Hoped for the best. Didn\u2019t really get there, but hoped in one hand. There are a whole bunch of plot devices used in There There, there are. You\u2019ve got the multiple character arcs that slowly start to overlap. You\u2019ve got that Perks of Being a Wallflower thing where every possible bad thing in life happens, and things just get worse and worse. You have the short, choppy writing where it feels like every paragraph is separated by a space to make the book seem longer than it actually is.It just felt like good ideas that didn\u2019t have enough time to simmer. Good ideas that were pulled taken out of the oven a little early so they were still too doughy in the middle. Good ideas that weren\u2019t penned down well, heavily pushed by a publisher. Ideas packaged in a bright orange book that jumped out at you when you see it on a \u201cbest of summer\u201d reading list, at the library, or at the front of the bookstore. Ideas that everyone reads about together and either goes all in or wonders what they missed. I definitely missed something here. Luckily, it\u2019s a quick read, and maybe next time Orange will have some time to really flesh things out a little more and really pull me into the world he\u2019s building and the story he wants to tell. I\u2019m gonna chalk this one up to hype, but this time it wasn\u2019t worth it.", "Massively exciting with what freshness and vitality this emerges from the blocks. The first hundred pages are a joy to read. Fabulous descriptive writing with lots of relatable insights into modern life. I liked its anger and humour a lot. There was a documentary on the BBC a while back that followed a few Indians who are on their way to protest at Standing Rock. I was sad I only got to spend an hour with them. They were all compelling individuals and I wanted more. The thing was though, the documentary focused on only four or five individuals and all had the space to strike up an intimacy with the viewer. The protagonists in this novel on the other hand run to double figures and I was soon floundering. I was unable to remember their connections. Also, some themes were repeated, as for example the child abandoned by a mother or father and when the grand finale takes place at a big powwow I was really struggling to recall who was who. As creative writing this was excellent; as a novel I think it would have been more successful had he cut the number of the characters.", "Indigenous ImmigrantsNorth and South America are inhabited almost exclusively by displaced persons.

But Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Lakota Sioux only possess any substantial cultural weight as Native American, a designation forced by circumstances. What they share is only displacement, not history, or language, or religion or social traditions. So neither Guthrie nor Whitman speak for the Native American. And neither, in a sense, does Tommy Orange. Rather he speaks about individuals whose commonality is a lack of commonality - except for finding themselves fetched up together in Oakland California as a sort of desert island for the dispossessed. Each story is unique, genuinely unique, because the cultural connection among them is this invented category of Native American.\u201cWe are the memories we don\u2019t remember,\u201d says one of Orange\u2019s characters. What is shared is a vacuum. For these people \u201cEverything is new and doomed.\u201d Even their identity which has been imposed by the dispossessors. The irony implied by Orange\u2019s use of the famous quote about Oakland \u201cThere is no there there,\u201d is doubled in these stories. Stein meant that what she remembered of her childhood in Oakland had been obliterated. For these Native Americans the problem is not displaced memory but an absence of it. One can only hope that Orange\u2019s \u2018tongue\u2019 is as effective as Whitman\u2019s in creating a coherent community in which to be oneself.", "\nThe novel is exceptional although it is very depressing. I'm not surprised There There has provoked so much discussion with regard to the plight of urban Native Americans trying to rediscover and understand their identity. There There is a definite food for thought!\n", "This debut is absolutely 100% incredible. Marlon James called it a thunderclap and I have to agree. This might be my favourite read of the year so far. And as is often the case when I adore a book this much, writing a review does not come particularly easy because I want to do it justice without just reverting to hyperboles.This book is told from 12 widely different perspectives that converge on the Big Oakland Powwow, and also includes some non-fiction parts in between. It is impeccably structured in a way that was both entertaining and heartbreaking and also very clever. I happen to really adore short stories that connect to a greater whole \u2013 and the first occurence of each person could stand on its own in a way that I found highly impressive.The voices are distinct and different, in tone and narrative choice, in the way their language flows and in the metaphors they use \u2013 I found the way Tommy Orange juggles these different styles impressive without being just that. Sometimes, when a book is this accomplished it feels very dry and intellectual, but this one was also very raw and honest and also angry in a way that really worked for me. Tommy Orange shows a great tenderness for his characters in all their flaws (and there are plenty).The book is funny and sad and poignant and just so so so well done. I do not have the words except to urge you to read it. I will be reading anything Tommy Orange decides to write next.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.", "Toward the end of Tommy Orange\u2019s devastating debut novel, a 4-year-old Native American boy keeps asking his grandma: \u201cWhat are we? What are we?\u201dThe boy has no way of knowing, but that\u2019s a blood-soaked question that Western invaders have made Indians ask themselves for centuries. Exiled, dispersed, murdered, robbed, mocked, appropriated and erased, Native Americans have been forced to define themselves amid unrelenting assault. Their survival, their failure and their resilience in modern-day America are the subjects of \u201cThere There,\u201d this complex knot of a novel by a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.Everything about \u201cThere There\u201d acknowledges a brutal legacy of subjugation \u2014 and shatters it. Even the book\u2019s challenging structure is a performance of determined resistance. This is a work of fiction, but Orange opens with a white-hot essay. With the glide of a masterful stand-up comic and the depth of a seasoned historian, Orange rifles through our national storehouse of atrocities and slurs, alluding to figures from Col. John Chivington to. . . . .To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert...", "Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2019 FinalistWinner of the PEN/Hemingway Award 2019Winner of the NBCC John Leonard Prize 2018Aaahhh, what a time to be a reader! First things first: Tommy Orange wrote a fantastic book, it is so strong, powerful, moving and enjoyable, and there's a whole bunch of people you will want to hit over the head with its wisdom (or with a physical copy of the book, for a start). Orange introduces us to more than a dozen Native Americans - men and women, young and old -, all of whom share a connection to Oakland and prepare to go to a big powwow in this very city. The core topic of the multignerational, multivoiced novel is identity: Orange tells stories about the urban Native experience, in a world in which many people connect Native Americans with stereotypes, the rez, or \"going back to the land\". Orange, who grew up in Oakland and has a Cheyenne father and a white mother, creates a caleidoscope of characters who ask themselves the question what it means to be Native today. They struggle with family problems, alcoholism, depression, and the consequences of being perceived as \"ambiguously nonwhite\". Like all of us, they want to belong to their home and their community (in this case Oakland), and to connect to their heritage. The voices feel utterly real and the individual people are drawn in a psychologically convincing manner - this is Hanya Yanagihara-level character building right here. I really liked how Orange uses music to illustrate the power of culture. Powwow music plays an important role in the text: The singing, the drumming, the regalia that dancers wear during their performances, and the dancing itself as an act to express one's inner feelings, the pain, the beauty and the pride. There are also references to Radiohead and Darren Aronofsky's \"Requiem for a Dream\" which make it clear how art can speak to our inner core and reflect what we carry inside us. One character in the book also continues the documentary film project that his late uncle had started which aims to tell the stories of urban Native Americans in order to improve representation and generate awareness - which is exactly what Tommy Orange does with his book (with fictional means, but rooted in his own experiences). Sure, parts of this book are slightly over-constructed, but you know what? It doesn't matter (if I want pure realism, I look out of my window). I was completely absorbed by this novel, I wanted to learn more, to hear more from these characters - it's not only the the importance of the subject matter, this book is a true joy to read it and utterly intriguing. Some people criticized that the ending was over-the-top, but I beg to differ: It's clear from chapter 1 that something like this will eventually happen, and when you read the final chapters closely, you can see how intricately Orange composed those final scenes, and that they are filled to the brim with ideas that point beyond the action in the foreground. I also disagree that the set-up is Tarantino-esque: I love good old Quentin, but he mostly uses violence as a carthartic element or as over-the-top-entertainment, and Orange does not do that here. The impact of the violence he portrays comes from completely different sources. What a brilliant guy this Tommy Orange is. He needs to write more books, ASAP!", "Fantastic!If you haven\u2019t heard of Tommy Orange yet, you soon will. This is one of those books that you're simultaneously dying to finish yet don't ever want to finish. Orange paints a vivid picture in short chapters through different points of view as the story unfolds. The powwow becomes the centerpiece of the story with the dozen or so characters eventually heading toward it. The characters and their storylines drew me in and made me care, though not all are likable. I grew attached to a lot of them (and sad to say goodbye when the story ended) like Jacquie Red Feather, Opal Bear Shield, and Blue. Powerful novel of the Urban Indians\u2019 identity, family, loss, and strength. It is truly a satisfying read and I hope there is a sequel. Found myself talking about it with family and friends who have not read the book. This may be my favorite book of 2018 and it gets a solid 5\u2605s+ from me!On a side note, my audiobook ended with Opal\u2019s chapter but the book ended with Tony\u2019s chapter.", "Such an important, powerful novel written from the perspectives of 12 Native Americans living in Oakland, California. Through these 12 distinct narrators, Orange shows the heterogeneity within the Native American experience, as these characters face unique challenges ranging from substance dependence, feeling disconnected from one\u2019s culture, a lack of self-worth and job prospects, and more. I loved how Orange addressed the past and ongoing genocide and displacement of Native Americans so head on. In the United States\u2019 education system, at least from my experience, we often gloss over the brutality experienced by Native Americans by white colonizers both in the past and in the present. Orange\u2019s There There speaks truth to power by giving voice to the struggles of Native Americans. I feel glad that so many have received the book well.All of that said, I struggled to connect to the characters on an emotional level given the sheer number of perspectives and the structure of the book. I think I get the statement made by the ending of the book and if so find it a powerful conclusion, yet, I wish the characters\u2019 internal conflicts had more room to breathe. Still, I would recommend this novel to those interested because of its sociopolitical importance and vivid and accessible writing style.", "Tommy Orange\u2019s There There is simply amazing! Yes, it\u2019s heartbreaking, but Orange\u2019s multigenerational story of the urban Native American experience is unforgettable. There are 12 distinct voices shaping the story, but they all resonate and feel bound together and drive the narrative forward. Far from confusing the story, each voice adds depth, grief, history and hope. There is also a certain rhythm to these interweaving stories that made this a difficult book to put down; you want to get to the end even though you know things aren\u2019t likely to end well. A fantastic book! Highly recommended!!  Fantastic to meet Tommy Orange at the PEN/Hemingway Award Ceremony at the JFK Presidential Library!", "FIVE NATIVE STARSOnce again, I am at a loss for words--BECAUSE I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH!! I was 100% invested in the characters and the story. I'm a closet Choctaw (meaning only that I am an enrolled member of the tribe, but not something I broadcast in my everyday life) and I was beyond excited to read a modern Indian story. Yes, as Orange points out, we refer to ourselves as Indian. It's okay. Don't hate on me. Watch out for Tommy Orange. He is a young Native American writer and he has something to say. This is his debut novel of fiction revolving around a group of contemporary characters, all native, some related to each other, others not. The story is set in Oakland where the characters are all planning to converge upon the annual powwow. The Big Oakland Powwow is also where Tony Loneman plans to carry out a robbery. Tony Loneman is a dark, 21-year old drifter and is severely affected by fetal alcohol syndrome.So, no Kevin Costner or John Wayne stuff here. This is the real story of real Indians in the very real 21st Century. Yes, the story is violent, but life in our gun-toting America is violent. Aside from the violence is a deep sense of optimism that resonated with me. Reflective, modern, and beautifully written. Tommy Orange, I will read anything you write!The audio production is brilliantly done by several actors. Highly recommend!", "Powerful, heartbreaking, and absolutely necessary. In the age of #blacklivesmatter and #metoo, we cannot forget about the Native American population who have been criminally ignored. There There is specifically about the people considered 'Urban Indians': the generation born in the city as a result of both voluntary and involuntary relocation of their ancestors (Indian Relocation Act/Indian Termination Policy).\n\u201cPlenty of us are urban now. If not because we live in cities, then because we live on the internet. Inside the high-rise of multiple browser windows. They used to call us sidewalk Indians. Called us citified, superficial, inauthentic, cultureless refugees, apples. An apple is red on the outside and white on the inside. But what we are is what our ancestors did. How they survived. We are the memories we don't remember, which live in us, which we feel, which make us sing and dance and pray the way we do, feelings from memories that flare and bloom unexpectedly in our lives like blood through a blanket from a wound made by a bullet fired by a man shooting us in the back for our hair, for our heads, for a bounty, or just to get rid of us.\u201d\n Tommy Orange has a voice that you can't help but open your heart to because everything about it is real: a history of genocide and the current condition of a struggling people, but not without smile-worthy moments of humor and beauty. Oh my heart. This is an excellent book. My favorite quote:\u201cWe all been through a lot we don\u2019t understand in a world made to either break us or make us so hard we can\u2019t break even when it\u2019s what we need most to do.\u201d", "\u201d Sing itHey boy, give your dreams a restIf you're tired of searching this is where it endsThere's nothing left to loseNothing to protestLearn to love your anger nowAnger here is all you possess.Welcome to the edge.\u201cBelow the towers of the citadelSeems someone overlooked the cost.Forgotten soldier of ParadiseNow Paradise is lost.Recognition never realizedSalvation lost among the crowdSo tell me here beside the sterile seaWhere is your nation now?\u201d\t--The Edge of America, Duran Duran, Songwriters: Simon John Charles Le Bon / Nick Rhodes / John Nigel Taylor\n\u201dAll the way from the top of Canada, the top of Alaska, down to the bottom of South America, Indians were removed, then reduced to a feathered image. Our heads are on flags, jerseys, and coins. Our head were on the penny first, of course, the Indian cent, and then on the buffalo nickel, both before we could even vote as a people\u2014which, like the truth of what happened in history all over the world, and like all that spilled blood from slaughter, are now out of circulation.\u201d\n\n\u201dThey used to call us sidewalk Indians.

With an upcoming Pow Wow to take place in Oakland, Dene hopes to win a grant to video the stories of those attending. As he\u2019s waiting for his interview, he has a conversation with another young man also waiting, who probably has never read Gertrude Stein, only knows the part of her quote about Oakland being \u201cThere is no there there,\u201d as though it\u2019s impossible to believe that anyone is really from Oakland. \n\u201dThe quote is important to Dene. This there there. He hadn\u2019t read Gertrude Stein beyond the quote. But for Native people in this country, all over the Americas, it\u2019s been developed over, buried ancestral land, glass and concrete and wire and steel, unreturnable covered memory. There is no there there.\u201d\nIt\u2019s soon time for his meeting with the panel, and his three minutes allotted to convince them that his project is worth the money they are going to spend on it.

Stories of despair, of poverty, of wanting to hold on to some part of their identity, of the things that tie them together in some way, but also recognizing how uniquely individual they are. Altogether, they tell one story with many sides to it, reflecting each other\u2019s stories until they all become one, in one brilliantly fashioned composition of heartbreaking artistry.A big thank you to my goodreads friend, Angela. I added this to read this only after reading her review, which let me know this was one I needed to read. Angela\u2019s review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Recommended!Many thanks to the Public Library system, and the many Librarians that manage, organize and keep it running, for the loan of this book!", "This novel references Gertrude Stein\u2019s comment about her memories of Oakland, CA, \u201cthere is no there there,\u201d upon discovering her family home was taken down to accommodate an office park. I think the characters in this book would say it differently, that there is indeed something in Oakland, home of the fictional Big Oakland Powwow with which it concludes.Distinct Indian voices tell a story about their lives, whatever they want to tell and not necessarily to an immediate point. Somehow it all comes together at the end, at the powwow. Family members find one another, and there is some recognition of their losses. It is a fantastic imagining of the experiences of many. The chapters are long and rangy at the beginning, shortening as the pace quickens and the powwow approaches. The interconnection between characters comes clear. It is beautifully woven together, each party distinct and yet having a similiarly destructive upbringing.What struck me most was, finally, the recognition of what happened to Native Americans and how diminished their legacy within their own tribes. There are many reasons for this, much of which we now realize was a shared responsibility we did not manage well. Orange doesn\u2019t shy from painful truths; there is a psychic cost to the lives our ancestors took, or oppressed, a cost that has been playing out for hundreds of years. Although there may have been writers before who captured that karma, Tommy Orange is particularly skilled at showing us the ravages in a range of folks who struggle under the burden of what they have lost. I alternately read and listened to the audio of this, produced by Random House Audio and featuring a full cast of readers: Darrell Dennis,\u00a0Shaun Taylor-Corbett,\u00a0Alma Ceurvo,\u00a0Kyla Garcia. It\u2019s a wonderful listen, and an equally a fine read. However you approach this, you will appreciate the insights. One of those insights helped me with a phenomenon I have never understood. The alcoholic uncle of one character came to visit his sister and her son. When he wasn\u2019t drinking, the uncle was full of interesting stories and was a pleasure to be around. One day the uncle told the boy he was dying and was visiting people he knew and liked before his time was done. The young boy asked him why he was still drinking if it was killing him. The uncle answered \u201cI\u2019m sorry you gotta see it, Nephew, it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s gonna make me feel better. I been drinking a long time. It helps. Some people take pills to feel okay. Pills will kill you too over time. Some medicine is poison.\u201dI never understood that.", "\u201cSome of us got this feeling stuck inside, all the time, like we\u2019ve done something wrong. Like we ourselves are something wrong . . . We drink alcohol because it helps us feel like we can be ourselves and not be afraid. But we punish ourselves with it.\u201d I think my expectations going into this novel were too high. I\u2019d read rave reviews and it was nominated for a National Book Award. Orange takes an unflinching look at the ways white folks have abused Native Americans for hundreds of years\u2014and show no sign of stopping ignoring sacred sites in the pursuit of raping Mother Earth. He also examines Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, and other crime among the Indigenous population. Why this story didn\u2019t work for me as well as it might have was because there were so many characters, I couldn\u2019t really bond and identify with any one of them. Also, even though I was taking notes, by the end of this relatively short novel (294 pages), I couldn\u2019t remember who all the characters were. The book reminded me of Yaa Gyasi\u2019s wonderful work, Homegoing, which also has many characters connected over time, but each chapter in that book was more like a short story, giving you the time to really care about the protagonist and see the world from his or her perspective. For more reviews, please visit: http://www.theresaalan.net/blog", "The history, both past and current, of Native Americans is important, however, I just couldn\u2019t connect with the characters.3 out of 5 stars", "In THERE THERE, Orange sets out his task from the beginning: he is going to write the stories of the urban Indian. These are not the stories of reservation life, they are not the stories of the old ways. These are the stories of conflict, of the search for identity, of struggle with poverty and addiction and loss, of family and community growing despite the concrete. In these connected stories of Native Americans (Orange, like many Natives uses the term \"Indian\" throughout the book) living in Oakland, reservation life is for most not even a distant memory but a place they have never seen or known. These characters are Indian and biracial, some are raised with Indian traditions, some come from families who avoid their heritage, some are raised in white households without any Indian influence. Common threads run through all of their stories, just like the characters who appear here and there, unexpectedly connected to one character and then another and another.Orange has the kind of prose that grabs you immediately. Reading this gives you the feeling that you are reading an important and groundbreaking book without the work that kind of book often entails. I sped through chapters, unable to put it down, even though each chapter has the kind of self-contained perfection usually reserved for short stories.A few practical notes for readers: Near the end I had trouble remembering exactly how characters were connected. A sheet of paper where you note the name and a couple identifying characteristics of the characters as they get their individual chapters (the chapter titles are their names, which simplifies this) would have helped me a lot near the end as the chapters get much shorter and we change perspective quickly. I also expect some strong reactions to the ending, it's the kind that comes at a natural end, but also the kind that is just the beginning of a whole other set of stories and it feels like you're picking up momentum just as it ends. The swiftness of it is probably my least favorite part of this book (I loved pretty much everything else) but I also appreciated how Orange avoided the kind of moralizing you'd tend to find in this type of ending.It's hard to believe this is a debut. Orange is a major talent and this is a major novel. ", "\n\"There There\" is not simply a powerful and moving and deeply accomplished first novel: it is the sort of book that even the most veteran novelist hopes to achieve and rarely does. I loved each and every voice in this kaleidoscopic vision of Native life in Oakland today as a pow-wow nears. This is an intense and haunting and absolutely terrific book.\n", "I loved it. It's structured so there are very short chapters, each one about a specific character, bearing his or her name. Orange has described the structure of the book as a \"braid\" and that's beautiful. There are so many characters at times it can be hard to keep their stories straight but I didn't mind looking back a few times. Orange sets up a dramatic event at the Oakland Pow Wow early on and the book builds story by story to a climax that is both inevitable and surprising. I only wish the ending was explicit. This is a book where history is worn by the characters like a very heavy backpack they lug from reservation to city and in between -- even those who try to suppress it -- all on land that once belonged to them. I was invested in all and there were some about whom I cared deeply. So I was not pleased that we don't find out what happened to some of them.A note on the prologue and a chapter called \"Interlude,\" which are not fiction. The facts contained therein are horrifying and Orange writes about them in brutally blunt, beautiful language. The information was new to me, and shocking. I've read a number of history books that go into the horrors inflicted upon our indigenous peoples (including \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" and a few by Vine DeLoria, Jr.), and also a lot of fiction by natives. But never before had I read the truth about the dishonest garbage taught in school about the first Pilgrims and natives and the story of an idyllic first Thanksgiving that turns out to be a sickening, toxic lie. Because Orange is a master of imagery and someone who can pack big ideas into short clauses, the two short nonfiction parts are very impactful and they add another dimension to understanding the author's fictional characters. It's a very impressive first novel and I can't wait to read more by Tommy Orange."], "genre": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/58040066-there-there", "avg_ratings": "3.98", "ShelvedNumber": "1741"}

It\u2019s why she\u2019s dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories.

You remember it vividly. But you also suddenly remember another life; your real life. And you are told that the life you remember is a result of FMS (False Memory Syndrome)-- an illusion created by your brain.I don't know about you, but that thought is horrifying.In this book, New York City cop Barry Sutton investigates the suicide of a woman with FMS. She killed herself after trying to make contact with the husband from her false memories and finding him married with a child. How strange it is that she remembers an entire life with a man who exists, but he doesn't seem to remember her at all. Barry finds himself needing answers.Eleven years earlier, neuroscientist Helena Smith conceives of a technology that can preserve memories and could eventually be a cure for the Alzheimer's that is stealing away her mother's mind. Funded by a mysterious billionaire, Helena builds something that enables people to relive their precious memories. But she never foresees the darker side of the project-- the side that triggers an unraveling of, not only the past, but reality itself.Needless to say, these two stories collide and it is some mind-bendingly awesome stuff. Crouch has written yet another weird, compelling and oddly romantic book. Like Dark Matter, you can expect this book to get bigger and wilder than you ever imagined before even a hint of a solution rears its head. I do also really enjoy how the author brings a lot of heart to these sci-fi thrillers. Sometimes sci-fi books feel a little cold and emotionally-distant, but Recursion is ultimately a very emotional and human story.

Yes, this book starts with jaw dropping scene and you\u2019re hooked! It\u2019s addictive, unputdownable, nerve damaging, exhausting ride! You wanna know what\u2019s going to happen and think about yourself if I had a chance to save my loved ones by turning back and making my wrongs turn into rights, what would happen! Saving her daughter from the traffic accident, curing your mother\u2019s Alzheimer disease, prevention of school shooting , saving soldiers from the terrorist attacks are just the samples writer show as in alternative realities that have possible to be changed! The difference of Recursion from Dark Matter might be romance parts because I really enjoyed Barry and Helena\u2019s love story. Not only they fought to bring universe into the right pattern but also they fought to get back together to be each other\u2019s final word, everlasting love, end game! This was thrilling, mind bending, provoking book! Dark Matters is going to be Netflix series and I\u2019m already sure that as a brain numbing project, this book finds its place at big screen on near future!Highly recommended, smart, different, unique and exquisite book but not for everyone!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter", "CONGRATULATIONS- Goodreads Choice Awards Science Fiction Winner!**********************\"Everything will look better in the morning. There will be hope again when the light returns. The despair is only an illusion, a trick the darkness plays.\"I'm convinced that Blake Crouch is THE science fiction/fantasy author of our time. You know, the one that readers pre-order their books without reading the description, the one that 50 years from now people are still talking about, dissecting his plot points and their dual meanings? Yeah, that's Crouch. If you don't agree, then that's ok, I'll respect your opinion. But also, FIGHT ME. While I've enjoyed all of the author's novels to date, Dark Matter is the one that sealed the deal in making me a life long fan. (But also Desert Places) Recursion is another worthy entry in Crouch's SFF productions, and one that felt reminiscent of Dark Matter, which made me a very happy Chelsea. Yes, the plot is unique in it's own way, but it still gave off those complex vibes that are a cross between \"exciting, high concept thriller\" and \"deep, emotional family drama\".\"How would I know if one had changed? What would it feel like?\" The premise of this novel is simple: What would happen if the memories contained inside your mind had never occurred? I'm not entirely sure how the author devised the plot for this book, but I imagine it stemmed from a simple question, not altogether different from the one presented above. Once you've read the book, it's easy to see how an entire novel could spring from such an innocent thought. It's clear that Crouch has a way with writing sagas that pull the heartstrings, because all of his ideas that evolve into stories are a delicate balance of intellectually stimulating action and moving, emotional love mingled with loss. The kicker is that the author knows how to write a science fiction that seems so dangerously close to reality, you find yourself turning the last page, shaking your head and chuckling because that could NEVER happen, but secretly wondering if it possibly could. If you enjoyed Dark Matter and its extraordinary premise, you'll likely fall head over heels for Recursion as well. A few of the same concepts are used in both novels, but each of these books are truly a labor of love in their own, unique way. Once again, I have found myself floored at how a person's mind could concoct such a brilliant scheme, and I'm looking forward to finding out where Crouch chooses to take us next. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.", "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull dayFritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home townWaiting for someone or something to show you the way.Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.Pink Floyd - TimeI am just going to say it \u2013 Blake Crouch is the King of Modern Speculative Science Fiction!Here is your crown, Your Majesty! We are not worthy!Imagine trying to follow up Dark Matter with something just as unique and mind blowing? I think I probably would have just stopped there if I had written it. The apex would have been reached. There is no way I could have topped it. Even trying would probably have fallen flat . . . feeling like I just could not have done any better.To which Emperor Crouch says, \u201cHOLD MY BEER!\u201dRecursion is just as mind blowingly unique as Dark Matter. And, much like Dark Matter I cannot say too much about why it is awesome and mind blowing without ruining it. So, I will give you an idea of in what way it blew my mind by comparing to a scene from an episode of Black Mirror. This comparison will not spoil Recursion, but it will spoil Black Mirror, so I will put it in a spoiler tag. If you have watched all Black Mirror episodes or don\u2019t care about spoilers, you can click it without concern.So, my mind was blown in the same way as (view spoiler)[ the episode where they are trying to get the guy to give details about a crime by interrogating a duplicate version of his consciousness that thinks it is the real him. At the end of the episode, they turn on a Christmas song and leave him locked in a kitchen listening to the song over and over. In the real world they just decide to leave him locked in as a form of torture over the weekend. But, to the trapped consciousness it will feel like billions of years not being able to eat, sleep, or stop listening to the same Christmas song over and over.

The only downside is now I will have to wait a long time to see what King Crouch will do next!", "Creative. Though-provoking. Emotionally-charged. Memorable.Whether you\u2019re a reader that frequents the sci-fi genre, or one that only occasionally takes a risk when it comes to the suspension of disbelief (hello, that\u2019s me!), recognizing and appreciating the level of creativity behind Blake Crouch\u2019s work takes little effort. Time and again, Crouch has proven just how rewarding it can be to take a chance on something different. Something totally outside of my typical. With Dark Matter (one of my all-time favorite books) and now Recursion, Crouch presents readers with a mind-bending reality. While each book provides its own unique and fully immersive journey, they share the provocation of deep thought and emotion on the part of the reader.Fair or not, my feelings for Dark Matter sent me into Recursion with the highest of hopes. Hopes that I thought were going to be shattered early on when focusing felt undoable. A science guru I am not. Wrapping my head around what these characters were trying to achieve with memory recalibration, while simultaneously trying to foreshadow how Crouch would tie the two timelines together, felt taxing on my brain. So much so, I had to take a breath for a few days. Following that brief timeout, I did would I should have from the beginning. Instead of trying to make sense of it all\u2014way too early on\u2014I handed the reins back to Crouch and put my faith in his ability to tell an unforgettable story. And sure enough, along the same vein as Dark Matter, there was no walking away unscathed or unmoved by his words or these characters.The first tease of the storylines converging was all it took for the pitter-patter of this idealistic heart of mine to speed up. And wouldn\u2019t you know, the two characters in question not only managed to steal my heart, but to hold it captive for the entirety of the remaining pages. It was with hope, fear, and bated breath that this lover of love watched the couple\u2019s pilgrimage play out. There\u2019s something to be said for Crouch\u2019s ability to relay a love story of this caliber within such an intricate and science-based thriller. There are romance authors out there who fail to pull off such an unwavering love; one that transcends several iterations, at that. \n\u201cMy soul knows your soul. In any time.\u201d\nFrom the very beginning to beyond the final words, Crouch\u2019s exploration of memory, and what it would mean to have the ability to go back and undo those moments that tether our pain, proves to be more than just imaginative fiction.Life with a cheat code isn\u2019t life. Our existence isn\u2019t something to be engineered or optimized for the avoidance of pain.That\u2019s what it is to be human\u2014the beauty and the pain, each meaningless without the other.*Thanks to my #bookbestie Haley for sending me a gorgeous ARC and for ensuring that I didn\u2019t miss out on this mighty piece of fiction. \u2665", "FIVE MIND-BENDING STARSBook readers tend to throw around words like \u201caddictive\u201d and \u201cunputdownable\u201d.

And cried again. And closed the Kindle. And kept thinking and marveling and sighing. Who doesn\u2019t want a do-over in life? Personally, I don\u2019t trust anyone that says they live with no regrets. Even if you consider yourself a perfect specimen, I guarantee you have deeply hurt someone\u2019s feelings or perhaps grieved the loss of a loved one. If those aren\u2019t regrets, then you may be a sociopath.What if you could go back through your memories and \u201cfix\u201d them? Change events in order to protect children, countries, civilizations. This is the question RECURSION poses to the reader.

NETFLIX already bought the movie rights and it is gonna be HUGE!!. Many thanks to the publisher and the author for allowing me to read and review the advanced copy of  RECURSION. All opinions are mine.", "Recursion has become the first sci-fi standalone to be included in my favorite shelves.As many readers probably did, my first experience with reading Crouch\u2019s work was for Dark Matter. I was super impressed by it and after hearing that the author has a new sci-fi thriller that\u2019s highly recommended for readers who loved Dark Matter gave me so much joy; it would be insane for me to not take a look at Recursion. Do note that taking a look at Crouch\u2019s novel can be surmised as reading the novel non-stop until completion. This book was undoubtedly exceptional; it was so good that it made Dark Matter\u2014which I loved and rated 4.5/5 stars\u2014felt like a practice novel so that Crouch has the skill to unleash the full capacity of his brain towards the creation of this cleverly crafted insanity.Two central characters drive the plot. The first main character is Barry Sutton, a cop that\u2019s investigating the mysterious phenomenon dubbed as False Memory Syndrome (FMS)\u2014a phenomenon that drives its victims insane with false memories of a life they never lived. The other main character, Helena Smith, is a neuroscientist that understands the importance of memory; she decides to dedicate her life to create a technology that could preserve any moment of the recipient\u2019s memories. This is pretty much all I can say regarding the general premise. Reviewing Crouch\u2019s book is not an easy task; there\u2019s a huge limitation on how much of the plot I can talk about unless I risk spoiling something and I don\u2019t want that. To avoid spoilers, I will say this: Recursion is a sci-fi thriller about memories and how precious they are in defining humanity and their sense of identity. Imbued inside this resonating theme was an addictive story about love, loss, ambition, redemption, and life.\n\n\u201cLife is nothing how he expected it would be when he was young and living under the delusion that things could be controlled. Nothing can be controlled. Only endured.\u201d \n\nWhen I started this book, I knew I would be thoroughly engaged by it and Crouch exceeded my high expectations brilliantly. Crouch outstandingly proved that he\u2019s super capable of writing a fast-paced story that doesn\u2019t neglect crucial characterizations. Dark Matter was thought-provoking and this book held similar philosophical discussions about life and choices but honestly speaking, Recursion resonated more with me because I believe that Crouch has improved as an author; his prose was extremely well-polished and the characters were more fleshed out. I truly didn\u2019t expect this novel to be this evocative and large-scale. There were moments where I felt genuinely sad, terrified, and heart-warmed by what the characters went through. The poignant thought-provoking passages made me reflect on life; the gradual increase in stakes and scope that eventually became more destructive and global as the story progressed fully stole my attention cover to cover. I\u2019ve been having difficulties in my life, it\u2019s almost as if this book appeared at the right timing to brighten my mood by teaching me how to think better moving forward; I\u2019m truly grateful for it.\n\n \u201cLife with a cheat code isn\u2019t life. Our existence isn\u2019t something to be engineered or optimized for the avoidance of pain. That\u2019s what it is to be human\u2014the beauty and the pain, each meaningless without the other.\u201d \n\nRecursion was relentlessly thrilling, unpredictable, and mind-blowing. Crouch\u2019s narrative was utterly unputdownable, the harrowing events displayed were enormously impactful, and I absolutely loved every moment of reading this vivid magnificence. I can vouch with certainty that Recursion broke a new milestone for me by becoming the first sci-fi standalone to be included in my \u2018favorites\u2019 shelves with a full 5/5 stars rating. Read this breathtaking novel as soon as you can. Trust me, you won\u2019t regret it.Sidenote:I heard Recursion is currently being planned for TV series adaptation by Netflix and I'm so excited for it!You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions", "Blake Crouch's latest science fiction thriller is a complex mind messing of a thought provoking read. It is intense, time shifting and asks profound questions of identity, memory, and what it is that makes us human. Just be prepared to find yourself buffeted all over the place. I understand that the novel is going to be filmed, and I am not surprised by this, this is a twisted story that just fizzes with energy and vitality. NYPD police officer Barry Sutton tries but fails to prevent a woman leaping off a skyscraper. Despairing and distraught, she spoke of false memory syndrome (FMS) with their vibrant and visceral memories and how her son has been erased, but he had never existed. Is FMS a contagion? A deeply troubled Barry, with his own past traumas, sets out on a journey to investigate.Helena Smith is a brilliant neuroscientist carry out cutting edge technology research on memories. A well intentioned woman, her mother is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which drives Helena's ambition and work on a memory chair, where she can record memories and re-implant them. Her project receives a huge boost when a rich philanthropist injects it with the necessary financial resources, but does he have a darker hidden agenda? Barry and Helena drive the narrative until their paths connect. What are the repercussions of having our memories manipulated and replaced? Is it a worthy desire to replace our painful memories? How does this impact our sense of who we are?Crouch writes a hard hitting, insane, ground shaking thriller, well constructed, full of tension and suspense, that rockets around all over the place with it's ideas and concepts. It certainly holds the reader's attention with ease, although I admit to enjoying Dark Matter more, there are times when this feels slightly more clunky on occasions. Strap yourself in for one hell of a thrill ride, movingly touching on some crucial issues, with its overt agenda of making you think. Many thanks to Pan Macmillan for an ARC.", "3 Stars. What can I say about Blake Crouch\u2019s new book Recursion? Well, it\u2019s got \u201ca Whole Lotta Crazy Going On!\u201d Can you say, do-over? Are your memories to be trusted? What happens if your memories are replaced with new ones and you keep re-living your life over and over?  Just ask NYPD Detective Barry Sutton, whose life has been in tatters for the last several years, ever since the death of his daughter Meghan. When he is called to the scene of a potential suicide, he learns of something called \u201cFalse Memory Syndrome.\u201d Ann Peters Voss claims that the life she is living now is not her original, true life. She states that she was once married to someone else and that she had a son and now, in this life, he ceases to exist. At first, Barry finds Ms. Voss\u2019 claims to be incredulous, until the same thing happens to him. Helena is the Scientist who is responsible for False Memory Syndrome. She finds a way to travel back in time to change memories and in the end, the world. For her, it started innocently, but then doesn\u2019t it always?  Timelines shift, reality becomes obsolete. Human nature takes over. \u201cRecursion\u201d by Blake Crouch is a novel that was highly intriguing at first, with characters who I was wholly invested in and then became way too technical for me, thereby losing my interest. I personally love Sci-Fi. I read a decent amount of it and tend to watch a lot more Sci Fi on television than anything else, and yet, I felt like Recursion, missed the mark as the novel wore on. The characters are what drew me into the story, yet around the mid-point of the novel the focus on the characters was lost when the timelines kept shifting, which became difficult to keep track of.  What Blake Crouch excelled at in \u201cDark Matter,\u201d was crafting a well-executed, highly entertaining story about what could have been a difficult subject to understand - and instead he made it extremely easy to comprehend, while including extremely captivating characters to boot. \u201cDark Matter\u201d was unputdownable! Sadly, \u201cRecursion\u201d was much more difficult to follow and the characters simply didn\u2019t pull me in. I read \u201cRecursion\u201d with my book buddy Kaceey. I think it might be the first true Science Fiction book we have read together. I loved our discussions about it and look forward to seeing how we feel about other Sci Fi books we read in the future. Thank you to NetGalley, Crown Publishing and Blake Crouch for an arc of this novel in exchange for an honest review. Published on Goodreads and NetGalley on 6.5.19.", "\"He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.\" - George Orwell, 1984This was a book I had to sit and think about before writing my review, mainly because I had to let it sink it. What would it be like to live your life over again? What would it be like to go back and change past events? How would this action affect your future? How would it affect the future of others? This book is deep and is thought provoking.Blake Crouch has written a very ambitious and carefully crafted book about memory, preserving memory, shifting reality, and using our memories and dangers associated with altering these things. He does this with skill and finesse. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall while he was writing this. Neuroscientist Helena Smith has dedicated her life to inventing a device which will preserve our memories. Her intentions are pure. She wants to help her Mother who has Alzheimer\u2019s, she wants to help those experience their happy times once again. But what happens when people begin experiencing False Memory Syndrome - a syndrome that causes irrational behavior in those who experience memories of lives they never lived.NYC police officer Barry Sutton begins to investigate the syndrome, he learns that there is more going on than meets the eye (or memory). As he digs deeper, he becomes more involved until he is knee deep in neuroscience, time, memories and a lifetime of trying to get things right.I highly recommend making note of the date/YEAR on each chapter as this book is told in both timelines. Things jump around a bit and can be confusing if you are not on your toes keeping track of your time lines. This is a book I really needed to sit and ponder after reading. I found that the more I thought about this book, the more I enjoyed it.Blake Crouch has a brilliant creative mind and he puts it to good use in this book. The beginning of this book was work for me until I found my rhythm with this book. Fans of his previous book Dark Matter will enjoy this one as well. I did enjoy Dark Matter more mainly because I found it was easier to follow but his one is good, but it took a little more (okay, a lot more) work on my part.I also loved that not only is this science fiction it is also a love story and Crouch writes some beautiful passages such as \u201c...I want to breathe the same air as you every minute of every day of my life, no matter how many timelines I live.\" and \"My soul knows your soul in any time line.\"Science Fiction fans, Crouch will not let you down with this book. Read those chapters headers and keep them in mind while reading each chapter as time does jump around. Thank you to Crown Publishing and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.", "4.5 stars\n\u201cThere is no past.\u201dRecursion is a provocative and mind-bending read about nonlinear time, the fluidity of memory, and the power of love. \nIn Recursion, a scientific invention allows for one to go back in time and save a life or prevent a tragic event from occurring. But changing the past has serious consequences in the present. False Memory Syndrome emerges resulting in suicides, bombings, and nuclear war. To stop the destruction of the chair, multiple timelines are created, leading to ultimate chaos.\n\u201cPerhaps memory is fundamental, the thing from which time emerges.\u201d\nThis is a fast-paced, action-packed, fascinating read that had me constantly examining my beliefs about memory and time. The writing is sharp, intricately plotted and surprisingly clear.  The plot is dense but manageable. While there are multiple timelines and events to keep track of, the structure of the novel made it possible to not get lost. The narrative is divided up into 5 parts, all of which focus on the aftereffects of the memory experiment. Told through the eyes of Barry, an NYPD Detective, and Helena, a scientist, their constant presence put me at ease and offered the clarity I needed when I got lost in trying to understand the science behind the shifts in time.This could have been an overwhelming convoluted mess, but Crouch has the ability to seamless tie all of the many threads together. There were parts when the science went way above my head--I will never fully grasp quantum physics, but I appreciated how this book had me continuously thinking. \nRecursion had my mind spinning and left me with my brain hurting. I don\u2019t read a lot of Science Fiction and this book took me out of my comfort zone--it was well worth reading and I highly recommend! \n ", "\nA dark, sci-fi thriller that had my mind bending in many directions!\nFrom the author of\u00a0\nDark Matter\n, which has been on my reading list for some time, but still haven't read it yet.\nWould you like a do-over of your life?\n\u00a0 Hmm, that seems like a loaded question and it is!

", " My thoughts in a nutshell I chose Recursion to be my first read by Blake Crouch and I definitely didn't regret it. Dark Matter is on my TBR for ages so it will be my next read by him.I don't read sci-fi nevertheless I was entertained by this one. At first, the whole book was so confusing. I don't understand anything about it, lol. I read it. I kept going. Then finally, I realized the concept. I have to tell you this is a brilliant and mind-blowing idea and I totally loved it.I thought a lot about what happened in the book. I can't imagine what it would be like if it actually happened.I adored that fact how much work and effort Blake could put into it. I have only one issue about it. I felt some part extremely repetitive and overwritten. I know, it was necessary but you can't guess how bored I was. It was a real struggle. The ending was too ideal and it reminded me of a perfect Hollywood movie.Overall, if you want to read a good sciency book, I would recommend it.", "Blake Crouch has done it again!!! Recursion was fascinating, confusing and brilliant!Dark Matter is one of my favorite sci-fi books of all time so I was almost scared to delve into Recursion - nervous it wouldn't live up to my expectations for Crouch. This book was ambitious. Thankfully, I had nothing to fear. Mr. Crouch's brilliant mind hasn't failed us yet. Recursion deals with memory - preserving memory, and using it to shift our reality. What a roller coaster ride this was. Can you imagine going back into a specific memory with all the knowledge you have now? What would you change or do differently if given the opportunity for a \"do over\"? Barry Sutton is a NYPD Detective who answers a \"jumper\" call. As he attempts to talk her down from the ledge he learns she is suffering from False Memory Syndrome - vivid memories of an alternate life. These memories feel real and those suffering from FMS have difficulty reconciling the dual memories/lives. Meanwhile, neuroscientist Helena Smith has devoted her life to memory research. She wants to map memories to preserve them. Her greatest hope is to help people with Alzheimers, Dementia and brain injuries. Ultimately she uncovers more than just a way to map memories. Her research leads to the discovery that causes FMS. Helena and her researchers travel back into past memories. This leads to changes which cause dual timeline memories for everyone involved. Barry and Helena's stories intersect as they find themselves face to face with the darker implications of the research. Each change comes with a cost. As more and more people suffer from FMS, mass hysteria builds. Are our minds strong enough to handle dual realities? Can multiple timeline memories coexist in the same person? Can the world handle this type of technology? Recursion certainly made me think and question everything I know about reality. I couldn't help but wonder about those moments of deja vu we all experience. What if there was more to them? Ultimately our memories make up who we are. They are definitely powerful and I love how Crouch explored this topic. It was thought provoking, emotional and made for fascinating reading.A huge thank you to Blake Crouch, Crown Publishing and Netgalley for the opportunity to read & review an arc of this book.", "Many thanks to Crown Books for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest reviewThis book was sent to me by the publisher!

Well, if you haven't, you don't know what your missing. Recursion is one of those books that you don't completely understand but.. You do at the same time. You know what I'm saying? Anyway, I don't have a good translation so ON TO THE CHARACTER ANALYSIS:\u27b5 Barry - Barry, a police officer (in one timeline, that is \ud83d\ude0f) who's daughter has recently passed away. Throughout the book, he deals with grief and guilt as aftermath of his daughter's death. One day, he is given the chance to redo the day his daughter died and he takes it, ending up saving her daughter. He begins to feel uncomfortable, feeling as though he's muddled with something he shouldn't have. Little does he know how right he is...\u27b5 Helena - Helena is the genius who invents The Chair, which is basically a time-traveling troublemaker. She too deals with guilt as her invention is used for purposes not intended. Her strength and endurance is shown as she does whatever it takes to rectify the problem she caused, no matter what it takes.Science fiction is one of my favorite genres. Since I was young, I have always loved seeing authors take real, hard facts and adding a dash of magic to them. It's been a while since I read a hardy science fiction. This did not disappoint. I didn't realize how much I missed getting shaky from excitement because I could see all the pieces fitting together. Even worse, I am now ruined for all other science victim because this was so well written.In Recursion, we follow the invention of The Chair which allows you to travel back to your memories and rewrite them. This is based on the idea that the present moment is an illusion. To put it simply, by the time our brains process stimuli, whatever sent that stimuli is already in the past. I did not realize that and when I did, I f**king lost it. I mean... People.. We are always getting old data and stimuli! Everything we see, hear, and feel is already in the past... AUUUGHHH. It's absolutely crazy! Anyway, slowly people start to realize the existence of the Chair and what it can do. And then... The sh*t hits the fan. Time travel happens and people's minds get f**ked up because the timelines are blending together and humanity cannot handle the mental toll. Now, Barry and Helena join forces in hopes of destroying the Chair.I think the best part of the book is that, because time gets royally screwed up, this book is told kind of our order making it confusing but simple at the same time. Blake Crouch uses the idea of time to his advantage and weaves a stunningly beautiful story. When (not if because you must read this book) you read this, you will find yourself not wanting it to end.Finally, I cannot recommend this book enough. It's one of those books that no review could ever do it justice.

It should. And if you loved the ideas behind The Butterfly Effect, Flatliners, and Groundhog Day, I'm certain you're going to fall head-over-heels for this novel.Am I giving too much away? No. Probably not. The novel goes well beyond the initial premises of memory replacement and mystery and a bit of the oddball secret conspiracy bits and dives straight into the heart of some really messed-up emotional family stuff, the implications of which flatlined me.And if anyone is worried that novels like these usually stop long before the full ramifications are revealed, rest assured. Crouch goes DEEP into the aftermath, aftermath, aftermath, aftermath. What we get afterward is not just a great mystery/thriller or an extremely solid SF novel, but one that is full of deeply emotional resonance and quality that will last long after the tale has finished.I call this a home run. And I like it even more than Dark Matter. :) I'm reminded of the quality I read in another's book, The Gone World. High praise, I think. :)", "If Black Mirror served as a surrogate for Groundhog's Day and Back to the Future, Recursion would be that test tube baby.This one starts out with a bang, or more like a plunk, as the story opens with a woman jumping from a building to her death, but not before she utters the words \"My son has been erased.\" to Detective Barry Sutton. What follows is two storylines, one where Barry searches for the meaning behind the woman's final words and one where researcher Helena Smith is developing a means to preserve the memories of Alzheimer's patients, such as her own mother. \"...what do you cling to, moment to moment, if memories can simply change. What, then, is real? And if the answer is nothing, where does that leave us?\"Sci-Fi has never been my thing, not even sorta kinda, until I came across Crouch's Dark Matter. He has a way of mixing the sci-fi and thriller genres in a way that makes it accessible to science impaired people like myself. I found the first half of this book unputdownable...and then my unmethodical brain reared its head leaving me with a permanent perplexed expression.All of the back and forth and forth and back and back and back and forth and back and forth and forth of the timeline was difficult to follow and often tedious at times. While I understand that it was part of the plot, I still think it could have been handled in a more reader-friendly manner. Overall I enjoyed this book, not as much as Dark Matter, but certainly enough to continue my mediocre attempt to branch out into this new frontier, with Crouch in the lead. I received an ARC from Crown Publishing in exchange for an honest review.", "YAY! The proud GR 2019 Choice winner!

The telescopes that peer into deep space are looking at ten-billion-year-old light from stars that coalesced just after the universe began.He\u2019s looking back, not just through space but through time.

Review first posted on Fantasy Literature:A sort of memory chair ... Recursion begins with a dual timeline in alternating chapters, a familiar literary approach, but then splinters into razor-sharp time shards as the characters deal with the explosive consequences of a new technology relating to personal memory.In November 2018, detective Barry Sutton attempts to prevent a woman from jumping from the 41st floor of a New York City tower. The woman, Ann, tells him she has False Memory Syndrome (FMS), a new affliction in which a person remembers an entirely different past for themselves, like their memory branched at a certain point in the past. The memories, though vivid, are in shades of gray. Ann\u2019s conviction that she\u2019s lost a life in which she had a happy marriage and a nine-year-old son was so compelling that she searched for \u2015 and found \u2015 the man she remembered marrying, who said he didn\u2019t recognize her, though Ann is convinced he did. Barry, deeply curious, begins his own investigation of Ann\u2019s past, and it leads him to danger as well as a to a chance to rectify a terrible event in Barry\u2019s own life.In October 2007, neuroscientist Helena Smith, haunted by her mother\u2019s gradual loss of her memories due to Alzheimer\u2019s, has dedicated her life and career to researching ways to preserve memories. She dreams of building a chair that will incorporate technology to record and project memories. Unexpectedly, Helena is visited by a stranger who offers her millions of dollars in funding if she\u2019ll come to an off-shore research facility (a converted oil rig) to continue her memory studies and technology development. She\u2019s met there by Marcus Slade, a billionaire business magnate and investor, who takes a suspiciously deep interest in Helena\u2019s research. Helena\u2019s research takes a turn toward the ominous, as Marcus pushes her research testing in directions she hadn\u2019t foreseen.In Recursion, author Blake Crouch stretches the concept of memory preservation into a technology that affects the very fabric of reality, expanding that idea to explore its most chilling, unintended consequences. Barry and Helena\u2019s race against both personal enemies and time itself are gripping. Although I couldn\u2019t entirely suspend disbelief in the pseudoscience, Crouch does a laudable job of giving it a plausible basis in quantum physics.\u201cYou really believe time is an illusion?\u201d\u201cMore like our perception of it is so flawed it may as well be an illusion. Every moment is equally real and happening now, but the nature of our consciousness only gives us access to one slice at a time.\u2026 Some other moment, an old memory, is just as much now as this sentence I\u2019m speaking, just as accessible as walking into the room next door. We just needed a way to convince our brains of that.\u201dThe pace of Recursion picks up steadily until terrifying events are occurring at breakneck speed. My other beef with the science is that the final resolution of the plot relies on a particular quirk of the technology that was a just a little too convenient, and doesn\u2019t really stand up to close examination. These are fairly minor quibbles, though. It\u2019s an outlandish plot, but you just need to suspend disbelief and roll with it.Though the focus of Recursion is on the action and suspense, Barry and Helena are engaging main characters with difficult problems in their lives that motivate their actions. There\u2019s also a brief cameo by Amor Towles (author of A Gentleman in Moscow), who seems to have an alternative life and career in the pages of this book, that made me smile (as well as wonder what the connection is between these two authors).Readers who enjoyed Crouch\u2019s previous techno-thriller, Dark Matter, will probably have just as much fun with Recursion. There are some distinct style and theme similarities between the two books, but the plots are different enough that Recursion doesn\u2019t feel like a retread. It kept me glued to my seat and reading far, far too late into the night.Thanks to Crown Publishing and NetGalley for the review copy!", "Helena is a gifted neuroscientist trying to develop a way to preserve memories. It\u2019s personal for her. Her mother has Alzheimer\u2019s. Helen is quickly running out of both time and funding. But at what price is she willing to move ahead?Barry is a New York City policeman. He\u2019s called to help talk down a woman threatening to jump from a building as she suffers from False Memory Syndrome. So little is known about this condition. Is it contagious? Is he willing to put his own life at risk to save her?I loved the first half of this book. I was all in and able to follow along easily! Couldn\u2019t wait to see where Blake Crouch's imagination and talent would take me! But about midway the complexity of the timelines and false memories got the best of me and I could barely keep up.

A mind twisting buddy read with Susanne Thank you to NetGalley, Crown Publishing and Blake Crouch for an ARC to read and review.", "5, WAT WAT WAT WAT WAT. Amazeballs stars!!! Full review along with a recipe for huevos rancheros featured on my blog Recipe & a Read!So, I feel like I need to start this out with a little caveat. I would put Blake Crouch\u2019s Dark Matter in my top 5 favorite books ever read. I absolutely adored it. Was I confused at times? Yes. Was I also completely and utterly thrilled the whole time I read it? Also, yes. I was both excited and incredibly nervous to read his upcoming novel Recursion because despite being a big advocate for not comparing things, I have a hard time not doing it. The ARC book gods #blessed me with an advanced copy of the novel and I put it off because I was nervous. However, once I dove in it gripped me with the same intensity I\u2019ve come to be familiar with Crouch\u2019s works. I\u2019m going to do my damn best to not compare the novels too much but I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I fail a little.Barry Sutton is a New York police officer who is called to the roof of a building to talk a woman down from jumping off the ledge. As he speaks to her, he learns that she\u2019s suffering from \u201cFalse Memory Syndrome\u201d a syndrome that leaves it\u2019s sufferers with vivid memories of a life that never happened. It\u2019s not just that they have a memory, it\u2019s that they are visceral and real. These people can remember smells, touches, the look on someones face, they remember the most minute details that create a rich picture of a life they\u2019ve never had. Some remember a life worse than the one they\u2019re living now, but others, like the woman Barry is speaking to, no longer has her husband or her son and her entire life feels meaningless and empty.Everyone thinks FMS is just false memories of the big moments of our life, but what hurts so much more are the small ones. I don\u2019t just remember my husband. I remember the smell of his breath in the morning when he rolled over and faced me in bed.Helena Smith is a neuroscientist with endless potential but a very limited budget for the dreams she holds in her minds eye. Helena\u2019s mother is suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s and she has a dream to create a memory chair \u2013 to store memories for people who can\u2019t hold onto them and give them back as they start to fade. When a wealthy and anonymous benefactor offers her unlimited resources she jumps at the opportunity. As Helena works on the chair she quickly realizes that not all is as it seems with her new partner and as her memory chair takes shape, so does the real reason Helena has been brought in.As Barry investigates FMS (more like FML, amiright) and Helena works on her chair we\u2019re given alternate POVs between the two. Barry finds himself in the middle of an incredibly convoluted mystery that even the most seasoned reader will have a hard time pinning down. It isn\u2019t until Helena and Barry\u2019s stories collapse upon one another that the real mind-fuckery beings to take place. Let me just tell you, one reader to another, this is a twisted mess of time travel, parallel universes, and the question of what it means to simply be alive and what makes us who we are.There are so few things in our existence we can count on to give us the sense of permanence, of the ground beneath our feet. People fail us. Our bodies fail us. We fail ourselves\u2026 But what do you cling to, moment to moment, if memories can simply change. What, then, is real? And if the answer is nothing, where does that leave us?Similar to Dark Matter I don\u2019t want to give too much away because one of the greatest things Crouch brings to literature is the utter shock and surprise that comes with his stories. They are so truly unique and original that I consistently find myself questioning how someone\u2019s brain even functions the way his does. Asking myself how someone can even begin to think this up. I think that if I tried to spoil this entire story right now, I may not even be able to because it\u2019s such a complicated and intricate web that Crouch has woven here. What leaves me even more impressed though, is that despite how complicated the story is, I was able to follow along *for the most part* because Crouch is able to make ideas that would normally fly right on over my head, accessible and tangible.Recursion is truly a whirlwind and it has everything any reader could ask for. It\u2019s exciting, thrilling, heart warming and gritty all at the same time. It asks questions I haven\u2019t ever thought of and created scenarios that made my brain ache to contemplate. It challenged me as a reader and it challenged my ideas of what creates \u201creality\u201d and \u201cthe present\u201d. I should\u2019ve read this with someone else because I wish I could have talked to someone who was reading it at the same time as me. However, I\u2019m super excited to add this to my list of book recommendations for the future and to discuss it then!I don\u2019t want to look back anymore. I\u2019m ready to accept that my existence will sometimes contain pain. No more trying to escape, either through nostalgia or a memory chair. They\u2019re both the same fucking thing. Life with a cheat code isn\u2019t life. our existence isn\u2019t something to be engineered or optimized for the avoidance of pain. That\u2019s what it is to be human \u2013 the beauty and the pain, each meaningless without the other.In the end this is another total slam dunk for me and I can\u2019t wait to see what Crouch comes up with next. This is a twisty novel that you\u2019re never going to be able to pin down where it\u2019s about to head next. It left me truly breathless at points because it felt like I was reading and the story was moving at break-neck speed. There were points I almost needed to take a break because so much is being thrown at you at once. If this review has confused you at all, I totally understand because this book is insane to try to explain. However, I still can\u2019t suggest picking it up enough!", "3.5 stars.This was some crazy s--t.\"What's more precious than our memories? They define us and form our identities.\"Blake Crouch's new book, \nRecursion\n, is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.Crouch's \nDark Matter\n, which was one of the top five books I read in 2017, blew me away, even though I wasn't 100 percent sure I understood everything I read. But this book? This is a fascinating, albeit confusing, meditation on memory and how crucial what we remember is to our identity. It's a roller coaster ride which cements Crouch's reputation as a master of meshing unbelievable science and emotion.Barry Sutton is a detective in New York City who is summoned when a woman is threatening to jump from a skyscraper. She tells him that she is suffering from False Memory Syndrome, which somehow leaves you with vivid memories of a life and experiences you never had. Often these memories feel more real than the life you are living, and it is immensely disorienting\u2014and possibly contagious. The woman tells Barry that she is devastated by the fact that her son has been \"erased,\" even though people tell her she never had a son. And then she leaps to her death.Meanwhile, Helena Smith is a neuroscientist who has been working on research to help map our most precious memories and how to preserve them. If she succeeds, people with dementia and brain injuries might one day be able to remember moments and people that have slipped from their grasp. The pace and scope of her research is significantly accelerated by the involvement and support of an eccentric, wealthy benefactor. But what's behind his interest?As Barry tries to investigate what's behind False Memory Syndrome\u2014or if it exists at all\u2014he finds himself in the middle of a disturbing mystery. Has someone figured out the ability to manipulate our memories and make us believe things that never existed? If our true memories are wiped out and replaced, does that change who we are? And at what cost?Barry and Helena's stories alternate as they represent both sides of the coin\u2014the beneficent research looking to make a difference in how we retain our memories, and the shadowy side, using memories for destructive purposes. \nRecursion\n started a little slowly for me, but picked up speed as the book moved along, until it careened toward a conclusion.The ideas behind the book were fascinating and thought-provoking, but the book itself didn't quite work for me as well as I had hoped given how much I loved \nDark Matter\n. Each story on its own was compelling but the constant shifting back and forth, and having to keep track of when things happened, often made me lose focus. But once again, Crouch proves his talent as a storyteller and a brilliant mind.If you're a fan of science fiction thrillers that make you wonder if what you're reading might actually be possible, pick up \nRecursion\n. And don't miss out on \nDark Matter\n or Crouch's Wayward Pines trilogy, because this guy knows how to write.NetGalley and Crown Publishing provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

You can follow me on Instagram at  https://www.instagram.com/yrralh/.", "I'm looking forward to reading more books by Blake Crouch because I enjoyed Recursion so much. We follow NYPD Barry Sutton and neuroscientist Helena Smith through decades and decades and decades of memories. They know the world is being destroyed due to Helena's invention and they try over and over to stop the destruction, with heartbreaking results, each time. Helena invented a \"memory\" chair that was intended to allow a person to save memories for later when they might be suffering from dementia or Alzheimer disease. But Helena is running out of time and funding, to complete the project, until she is contacted by a secret benefactor, who is willing to give her everything she needs to finish her project. At the same time, Barry is encountering suicides due to False Memory Syndrome and his investigations set him on a path that collides with Helena's invention. I didn't let the technical and scientific talk hold me back from enjoying this book. I trusted the scientists and the characters, who studied the phenomena that was taking place, to provide the details I needed to carry the plot forward. What I really liked about the book were the characters of Helena, a woman so focused on her work that she rarely looked up, and Barry, father of a dead girl, who was never going to get over the heartache of losing his daughter. As these two characters come together, more than once, their concern for the welfare of others and their relationship with each other, kept me reading to the very end.

WINNER! goodreads choice awards best science fiction 2019!this is the most jonathan carrolly book not actually written by jonathan carroll, once you replace\u2014or at least incorporate\u2014his brand of metaphysics with pure physics. the writing isn\u2019t as graceful and the dialogue doesn\u2019t come near the packed potency of a great carroll-penned conversation, but the concept is deliciously similar, with time travel standing in for afterlife/reincarnation/some other \u2018second chance\u2019 opportunity of jc\u2019s own imagining, and for the first chunk of it, i was digging how much it reminded me of carroll\u2019s work, since he is one of my all-time favorite writers. the middle of the book was decidedly less carrolly, but that ending\u2014hoo boy\u2014brought it right back into my sweet spot. it\u2019s funny, because i\u2019d been dreading the ending. i was talking about the book with a co-worker, after HE INTERRUPTED MY READING about thirty pages from the end, asking me how i was liking it \u2018so far,\u2019 and i told him i had no idea how he was going to manage to wrap it up in what little of the book was left and i was fearing some deus ex machina situation in the form of, i believe i phrased it, \u201csome magical portal elixir or something.\u201d but no, there was nothing of the sort, and the solution made more sense to me than a lot of the middle of the book did (which is not blake crouch\u2019s fault\u2014i am notoriously bad at wrapping my head around time travel and its attendant repercussions), and the three-quarters mark to the end-end was beautiful and poignant and so tenderly human, full of sacrifice and such brave and profound suffering it made my twisted little heart ache a bit. what i liked about this book, and Dark Matter before it, is that even a dummy like me whose brain starts throwing sparks when forced to think about any kind of science that\u2019s not observable\u2014plants, animals, rocks? sure. wormholes? fuckity-bye!\u2014can appreciate them, because they\u2019re more than just their sciencey aspects\u2014they\u2019re about human relationships; about love and loss and regret and missed opportunities and trying to make better choices in the futurepast. they\u2019re deeply empathetic, which is not always a priority in hard SF, so i appreciate it immensely in crouch\u2019s novels. this one is focused on a technology designed to help alzheimer\u2019s patients hold onto their disintegrating memories\u2014in essence, preserving their identities\u2014by allowing them to relive events in their lives, but that kind of technology can be easily perverted toward less-altruistic applications, and the unanticipated side effects are catastrophic. what follows is an ethical roller coaster with a frighteningly convincing slippery slope of scientific advancements developed with good intentions derailed into morally-questionable-but-maybe-still-okay-territory before flying off into oh noooooooooo everything is wrong and horrible and dear god WHY???, building to an almost excruciating tension where everything is so dire and the ethical quandaries so murky, there seems to be no way out short of a magical portal elixir, but crouch manages to pull off an elegant landing; one with real emotional resonance.highly recommended even to readers who are time travel-averse, because even if the the middle makes your brain nopethere'll be a bittersweet reward at the end of it all.come to my blog!", "Wow....I didn\u2019t even think I was going to like this book....I\u2019m not a die-hard science fiction fan..... but \u2018occasionally\u2019 I\u2019ll take the plunge. I found \u201cRecursion\u201d, fascinating- and it kept me hooked..... I didn\u2019t expect any of this....this much enjoyment. It got me thinking of things I never do: parallel universes... physics...time....space...energy... Philosophy....the different universes within the multiverse.....and False Memory Syndrome.....(woke-up my imagination neurons)....and all that went wrong. I thought it was:#1 great storytelling with interesting characters whom I cared for.#2 Hopeful into preserving memories for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. #3 the mystery thriller aspects.#4 Great settings#5 The pure fantasy of it all.#6 Satisfying ending. #7 This created a stimulating conversation between Paul and I about what we might change in the past if it were possible. \u201cBecause memory\u2026 is everything. Physically speaking, a memory is nothing but a specific combination of neurons firing together \u2014 a symphony of neutral activity. But in actuality, it\u2019s the filter between us and reality. You think you\u2019re tasting this wine, hearing the words I\u2019m saying, in the present, but there\u2019s no such thing. The neutral impulses from your taste buds and your ears get transmitted to your brain, which processes them and dump them into working memory\u2014 so by the time you know you\u2019re experiencing something, it\u2019s already in the past. Already a memory\u201d. ", "The past, the present, and the future walked into a bar. It was tense.That\u2019s an editor\u2019s joke and it always cracks me up; I love how clever it is. Well, with this book, the past, present, and future walked into my head, and it was tense, all right, but not a good tense. It was tense because I was friggin\u2019 confused. And nothing about it cracked me up or made me think it was clever.Well, I lie. At the beginning I was all gung-ho. The opening scene is a killer\u2014a likeable cop, Barry, is trying to talk a woman off a ledge. He\u2019s a good cop with a painful past. And the other main character is also likeable: a scientist, Helena, who created a chair so that people who sat in it could restore their memories\u2014she hoped to help her mom, who had Alzheimer\u2019s. There also is an evil guy who has very bad chair plans. The chair is a big, big deal.At the beginning, there are just two timelines: a present, action-filled timeline, and a tantalizing one created by some cool thing called false memory syndrome, which possibly is contagious. Juicy, right? And at first, oh how I loved that chair! It was spiffy, inventive, magical, smart. I was patting myself on the back because I was reading sci-fi, damn it, and I was loving it. This Crouch guy can write. Interesting characters, fast-moving plot. I\u2019m so in.Before I say anything else, I have to explain how I came about reading sci-fi\u2014I who love literary and contemporary fiction. It\u2019s simple: I was stupid\u2014stupid not to have read the blurb. I pride myself in going into a book blind. No spoilers for me, no sirree. I want to be totally surprised. This time, though, I should have broken my rule and saved myself the pain of reading this book. Bad idea to go into it blind, bad idea.So why did I choose this book in the first place? I blame it on the damn TV. I watched a smart series called Good Behavior, a show about a sexy hit man and his sexy con-woman girlfriend (Michelle Dockery from the TV series Downton Abbey). Every time the credits rolled at the end of an episode, I saw that the writer was Blake Crouch. Blake Crouch, Blake Crouch, Blake Crouch. Zap! Hit me with that cool name enough times, and it\u2019s planted in my memory forever. So when I saw that he had just published Recursion, I thought, hey, why not read it? I loved his TV series. All jazzed, I figured I was settling into a clever crime drama. Wrong! Imagine my surprise when I realized immediately that it was sci-fi. How did I know the writer can do different genres? I\u2019m innocent here. This book went from a 5 to a 4 to a 3 to a 2, and so did the beloved chair. What a plunge! Wish it had been an exciting countdown instead of a case of falling stars. It was a slow decline at first, but by the last third of the book, I was a maniac. I wanted to be a bossy bitch and tell Barry and Helena to stand up and move, not sit still in that horrid chair. \u201cNo no no no no. Do not, I repeat, do not, sit in that chair one more time!!! Step away from the vehicle! You\u2019ve been here and there and then back again just too many times! I\u2019m sick of this! You\u2019re driving me nuts!\u201d This chair that I once loved? Now I hated it with all my might. Every time they sat, they went to another timeline and the story got completely confusing. Memories were all over the place. We\u2019re not just talking your garden-variety memories\u2014there are false memories and dead memories, too. How was I expected to tell them apart? And to make matters worse, we were told to question reality: I couldn\u2019t tell if the characters were in reality of any sort (and they couldn\u2019t either). Did the past really happen the way they\u2019re saying it did? Or were they in a fake past reality?You\u2019re supposed to be sad when a main character dies, it\u2019s supposed to be a big deal. But in this book, who cares? You\u2019ll probably see them alive in the next chapter! The characters die and get alive again so many times, it\u2019s ridiculous. It was like they cried wolf too many times: \u201cI died. Feel sorry for me. Just kidding, here I am again. Okay, this time I really did die. Ha! Fooled you again!\u201d Now how can you care about the characters with this going on?!Oh, and another peeve. Usually, when the characters went back to the past, they remembered the future, which you might expect, right? But sometimes they got all scared and acted like they were clueless about what would happen next. Huh? Why were they scared when they knew the outcome? This just seemed like bad writing, and it bugged me to death.I know there are people who bounced back and forth through memories and timelines and had a hell of a good time reading this book. I just wasn\u2019t one of them. I wish I could just sit here in my regular (but nonetheless spiffy) chair and erase the memory of reading this book!Thanks to NetGalley for the advance copy.", "the thing i admire about blake crouch is how he can take a story centred in one particular genre, but make it accessible and enjoyable to everyone. this book is everything that is right in the sci-fi world and is proof that sci-fi can be written exceptionally well and appeal to the masses, regardless of individual genre preferences.not only is this story living in a dangerously close reality, where scientific and technological advances play a massive role in society (for better or worse), but the thriller/mystery aspect of this is what drove my interest significantly. memory is such a fascinating topic to me, so much so that i studied cognitive psychology at university, and this story really excels with illuminating how memory ties people together. gosh, the level of human connection in this is unreal. that being said, \u2018recursion\u2019 isnt quite as perfect as \u2018dark matter\u2019 is. and maybe i had too high of expectations but there are a couple of things that stopped me from completely obsessing over this. books 1, 2 and the epilogue are the definite peak of this book. but the rest is quite tedious and repetitive. the government also gets involved and, while realistic, it was an instant mood changer for me. regardless, this is quite an enthralling story and has me excited to see where the insanely creative brain of BC will lead to next. \u21a0 3.5 stars", "ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review via NetGalley.5 STARS!Full review up!Recursion was a science fiction thriller that kept building and building for an epic finale!I\u2019m still thinking about the ending of Recursion today. It\u2019s a hard driving look into what is the meaning of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, much less the possibilities of rewriting mistakes and tragedies in your life.Recursion starts off with a woman jumping to her death in front of NYPD detective, Barry Sutton. Barry doesn\u2019t understand what caused her to do this, why she has false memory syndrome and wants to know what it is.Is this contagious?Will he get it now that he\u2019s had contact with this suicidal woman?So begins the journey of Barry tracking down what false memory syndrome is and how it will destroy a person. His journey introduces him to a fascinating and brilliant scientist named Helena Smith.Helena has been working on a technology that will change the world and let us relive intense memories. She\u2019s hoping this cutting-edge technology will help Alzheimer patients and the loved ones who are dealing with this crippling disease.Recursion blew me away with reality theories along with what the mind is capable of doing. This book asked the questions about playing God, along with whether it\u2019s a good idea.Isn\u2019t the whole point of being human to experience the good and bad memories in your life? It's not necessarily a pretty experience and gets slightly messy.Did you love Dark Matter? Well, I think you\u2019ll love Recursion too!It\u2019s an unyielding thriller and excellent science fiction book that asks the tough questions on morality, time travel and excepting the good with the bad.Kudos to Blake Crouch for producing a complex plot in where I\u2019m thinking about the book days later!!Recursion will likely be the best science fiction book that I\u2019ve read this year!!"], "genre": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Science Fiction", "Time Travel"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/64277987-recursion", "avg_ratings": "4.19", "ShelvedNumber": "1700"}

{"published_year": "2017", "rating_counts": "79687", "ISBN": null, "description": "A sharply intelligent novel about two college students and the strange, unexpected connection they forge with a married couple.Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, Conversations With Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth.\"", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500031338l/32187419.jpg", "title": "Conversations with Friends", "authors": "Sally Rooney", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends", "reviews": ["A very tepid 3 stars. Conversations with Friends is another one of those books about not particularly nice people entangled in awkward relationships. I've certainly read many books of this nature that I've found clever and quite enjoyed, but this one was just ok. Frances and Bobbi -- both young women who used to be in a relationship with each other -- become entangled with somewhat older heterosexual couple Nick and Melissa. It's all told from Frances' perspective. She doesn't seem to be able to figure out what she wants. Nor does anyone else. It gets messy and it stays pretty messy. I was attracted to this one partially because it is set in Dublin, but it could have been anywhere in North America or Europe. I'm at a low three stars because I did enjoy the the first half of Conversations with Friends, but my enjoyment started to wane in the second half. Frances' inner gaze and self-centredness started to feel suffocating. I don't have much more to say. Time to move on to something that makes me less grumpy. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy.", "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about aging lately: the way our perspective changes and how our need for stability, trust and healthy relationships become so much more valued than intoxicating, crash-and-burn emotional roller-coasters of our younger years.I say this as means of introduction because while reading Conversations with Friends, it occurred to me that those readers who are not familiar with the confusing yet exhilarating times of poor choices mixed with a great deal of egotism and sense of invulnerability may not like or relate to these characters. It\u2019s easy to miss the precision dance that Sally Rooney is performing here.But then is this book about the poor choices of youth or about one particularly fractured character who is destined to keep making those choices into adulthood? The book centers on two girls in their early 20s \u2013 our narrator Frances and Bobbi, her best friend and one-time lover. Together, they make the acquaintance of a couple a decade older: the composed and successful Melissa and her handsome husband Nick, an emotionally fragile actor whose career seems to be stalled despite an abundance of talent. Inevitably, Frances and Nick hook up, wrecking more damage on their own world and on the worlds of everyone around them.The \u201cconversations\u201d alluded to in the title are eloquently expressed but never get to the heart of things. Frances, who is unable to admit her love for Nick\u2014even to herself\u2014says, \u201cWe can sleep together if you want, but you should know I\u2019m only doing it ironically.\u201d Or later: \u201cI just don\u2019t have feelings concerning whether you fxxk your wife or not. It\u2019s not an emotive topic for me.\u201d Of course it is, and the constant self-harm Frances imposes on herself\u2014picking furiously at her nails, biting her inner cheek, cutting herself\u2014reveals the extent that her repression is harming her.As Frances whirls in place, the product of an alcoholic father, an enabler mother, and her own making, the core of Frances reveals itself: she feels like a damaged person who deserves nothing, believing that those she loves are exalted and somehow special. \u201cSuffering wouldn\u2019t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn\u2019t make me special,\u201d she reflects at one point. To reveal oneself is dangerous in a world that often conspires against you. This is one of the most interesting psychological profiles I\u2019ve read in a long time with an ending that made me gasp.", "I didn't really respond well to Conversations with Friends. The writing itself is quite good in terms of realistic dialogue and description, but I found all of the characters entirely unlikable and hard to empathize with, very few with any positive animating traits, mostly just self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious. Either in addition to or because I didn't respond to the characters, I also didn't respond to the plot well: the stakes seemed very low, there seemed to be little personal growth from any of the characters (despite this being a story entirely focused on people rather than situations), and when more or less the entire main cast is unlikable, it can be hard to invest in an outcome. Because the craft itself was strong, I'd give this 2 stars and say \"it's ok\" overall, but I wouldn't recommend it personally.The central conceit is two twenty-something friends and former lovers, Frances and Bobbi, get pulled into the orbit of photographer Melissa and her actor husband Nick. Then France and Nick become drawn to one another, and begin an affair that leads to uncomfortable situations and confrontations with Bobbi, Melissa, and their friends and family members. It's set in Dublin, Ireland, but the way it's written and the poetry-art-acting cultural trifecta it hits, it may as well be set in California. It didn't feel particularly Irish at all, so I was a bit lost on sense of place and specificity.We see things from Frances' perspective, which might be part of the difficulty with this read for me. Frances is entirely selfish: she begins the book that way, and aside from maybe inches of character growth, she also ends the book that way. We're told how intelligent she is, but she seems to be perpetually blushing, blundering into things, acting cruelly and capriciously when it suits her, and retreating to dark corners to cut herself when she's incapable of expressing her true feelings. It didn't help that Frances is also living off an allowance through her father, not feeling pressed at all to support herself for much of the novel, content to wallow in her feelings for Nick and assert dominance and indifference to him to disguise her growing dependence and obsession with him. (They say it's love, but honestly these characters are all so selfish it's easy to think that they say it's love but it's not.) Nick meanwhile is a somewhat caddish, sad, broken and oppressed man, mildly unhappy with his life but without real power or impetus to change it. Not all characters need to be likable in order to enjoy a novel about them - I can think of plenty of anti-heroes and somewhat nasty characters that are delightful to read - but I struggled greatly trying to empathize with these characters, finding very little compelling about their personalities and their decisions, but also not being poorly behaved enough to be completely disgusted with them. That made it very difficult for me to engage and be entertained or informed while reading. Bobbi is a decent side character and has a greater, more complex personality, while Melissa never comes across as more than a controlling, dominating woman (possibly because we're in Frances' perspective, and Bobbi is her former lover and best friend, while Melissa is her rival for Nick's physical and emotional affection and attention).When the focal point is an illicit, uncertain relationship and the rest centers on other relationships spiraling and changing in reaction, you don't want the writing to put distance between you and the characters. As good as Rooney's craft is, I did feel as though I was peering into their lives and their messy actions but at arms length, and again hard to say if the writing was responsible or my disinterest in the characters. I would want to feel immersed in the action, pulled in and maybe disgusted or titillated or both, but fundamentally unable to look away (very much how I felt reading White Fur). With Conversations with Friends, I was just bored, feeling the distance and not caring that neither myself nor the author was taking pains to close the gap. And the scenes of sex and intimacy did not feel charged or challenged; they seemed pathetic and pitiable, but in the most banal way, so I had little sympathy for Frances or Nick as they embarked on their affair. There's not much more to it: again, it's a novel of relationships, and there aren't huge plot elements or set pieces or massive emotional bombs. It quietly crawls along, never fully climaxes, and resulted in a sort of ambivalent ending that made a lot of sense to me based on the selfishness of these characters. I do believe Sally Rooney has writing talent, and there are some good paragraphs and dialogue in terms of craft. But I could not connect with this book at all, and was too bored by the characters and wearied by the proceedings to hate them. Again, the writing was good enough that I think it warrants two stars, and perhaps other people will find more that speaks to them from this book. But it was absolutely not for me.", "i posted this review!: https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...here's where i'd usually say one more nice thing in order to convince you to click the link, but i think i've exhausted the world's supply of nice things already.-----------I have a debilitating rereading problem.It\u2019s reached a concerning point -- seemingly 1 in 3 or 4 books I read is actually a reread. Previously I was way too picky about adding books to my to-read list to suffer a massive TBR issue, but now that I\u2019m barely reading new books, the pile (which is a physical one in the corner of my room, stacked by color because a) rainbow shelves forever and b) I am out of shelf space) is looming. Concerningly.If I die mysteriously, I was probably crushed by the blue stack. (I also seem to have a problem with buying blue books, specifically.)Anyway. My sole limit has always been that I must wait at least one year after my initial read before reading it again. This is my last shred of rereading-related logic and sanity.This book smashed that sh*t to pieces. Less than five months after I read it for the first time, I was rereading.I could make excuses. \u201cMy flight was delayed and I only brought one book, \u201d I could say, and it would be true (and a fatal mistake and a shame upon my bookworm title). \u201cI happened to have this one because the person I lent it to gave it back.\u201d But it was a nighttime flight, and I finished my first book on board, and I had to go out of my way to turn on that reading light that is really more of a goddamn chandelier considering how well it illuminates everything in an eight-foot radius. (Sorry, everyone around me.)Also, it was a short flight and I only got 50 or so pages into it. I easily could have put it down.This is where it\u2019s the book\u2019s fault.This story is not action-packed, nor particularly suspenseful. Neither is it jam full of what you\u2019d call Exciting Events or even a traditional love story that gets you rooting for your couple in any familiar way.In spite of all that, it is absolutely unputdownable.Conversations with Friends, if you are one of the few who somehow haven\u2019t read it yet, is about Frances and, less so, her best friend and ex-girlfriend Bobbi. Frances is thoughtful and cool (in the less-used definition of the word, according to my lexicon), Bobbi is effervescent and charming. They encounter a married couple, Melissa and Nick, and much of the novel is devoted to the changing ways in which the four interact with each other. The writing is beautiful. Sally Rooney\u2019s style is clean and sharp and true. Each word is thoughtfully chosen. Each image feels real and complex. Her New Yorker profile (which I read in a fit of desperately needing to get my hands on everything Rooney has written, in the wake of my first encounter with this book) highlights a description of a party at Melissa\u2019s home as \u201cfull of music and people wearing long necklaces.\u201d Conversations is teeming with terse, evocative descriptions like that, and if you\u2019re anything like me once you start reading writing like that you\u2019ll never want to stop.Being forced to stop by the dearth of Sally Rooney material has been very difficult for me.Like the writing, the characterization is somehow spare and complete at once. Frances and Bobbi, Melissa and Nick, even the background actors and extras of their lives are stunningly real. I think about Frances and Nick especially all the time. I can identify statements in life as \u201cvery Bobbi\u201d or \u201cexactly Melissa\u201d or \u201ctotally something Frances would say.\u201dAbove all, this book crawled inside my head and stayed there. It ever-so-slightly changed the way my brain works, but mostly it made me feel noticed and heard. It seems a way of looking at the world I hadn\u2019t realized I ascribed to is captured in these pages. It\u2019s surprising and kind of spooky and I\u2019m truly grateful I encountered this book at all.Lastly, it wouldn\u2019t be a review of mine if I didn\u2019t confidently write about something I\u2019m likely not qualified to. And I want to say f*ck everybody who acts like Sally Rooney is some kind of lesser writer because she\u2019s young and a woman. There\u2019s a difference between saying \u201cthis writer is not for me\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t like this book, and therefore everyone who calls her brilliant or talented is actually wrong.\u201dYou don\u2019t spew that sh*t about the bajillion dead white male writers. Your internalized misogyny and ageism is showing.Bottom line: Sally Rooney is brilliant and talented. The end. \u2764\ufe0f-----------just as just as just as good-----------there's never a wrong time to read sally rooney.even if that means a reread less than 5 months after the first time you read it.-----------upping this to 5 stars because i can't stop thinking about it, and also in all that thinking i can't remember a single flaw-----------I AM FEELING...SO MANY THINGS.review to come / 4.5 stars-----------i bought this book 2 days ago and have not really put it down since", "The narrator of Sally Rooney's Conversations with Friends at one point states that she never wants to work.I had no plans as to my future financial sustainability: I never wanted to earn money for doing anything. [...] I'd felt that my disinterest in wealth was ideologically healthy. I'd checked what the average yearly income would be if the gross world product were evenly divided among everyone, and according to Wikipedia it would be $16, 100. I saw no reason, political or financial, ever to make more money than that.You have to put up with this girl for 321 pages. Have fun!", "There\u2019s a cliche in reviewing where you say something along these lines: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like these characters in real life, but I found them compelling.\u201d See, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why this book works. I think this book works because in real life we would probably like these characters; respect their talent, find them interesting if at times flawed or condescending, look up to them on a level at which we would at times resent them and at times want to be them. It\u2019s just that none of us would ever know these characters, because these characters do not want to be known.\n\n\u201cYou underestimate your own power so you don't have to blame yourself for treating other people badly.\u201d\n\nConversations with Friends is a book about four people: two ex-girlfriends and best friends, Frances and Bobbi, and a married couple, Nick and Melissa. Frances and Nick end up falling, over time, into a strange romance. But\u2026 it\u2019s not about the cheating. The book refuses to make it that simple. Bobbi and Melissa have their own strange connection, as do Frances and Bobbi, as do Nick and Melissa, of course; the six connections within this circle are all given both pagetime and weight within the narrative. On some level, we\u2019re not rooting for any one of these characters over the others; we see the complex levels on which any ending for these four would be painful. At times, I disliked all four of these characters; at times, I loved all four. But at all times, they felt real.(view spoiler)[There is a scene in this book in which Frances goes home to her father and plays nice and awkward for an afternoon, and looking into a dishwasher, feels \u201ca sudden impulse to harm herself.\u201d It is small and brief and a throwaway line and yet it felt so vivid, so real, that I was unable to pull out of my head the feeling of standing there waiting for the storm to come, desperately, and suddenly feeling as though the world will come apart if you do not hurt yourself physically, a sign of how your insides are being torn apart. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[There\u2019s a line where Frances says she enjoys talking to Nick because he gives her unconditional empathy, while Bobbi \u201capplies her standards\u201d about the world to conversations about Frances. I don\u2019t know why that hit so hard I just know that it did? (hide spoiler)]There\u2019s this quote from a New York Times oped that I think about a lot:Frances\u2019 central conflict, as we learn over the course of this book, is that she is unable to allow others to see her vulnerability, to see that she cares for them or is hurt by them or even that she simply enjoys their company. She wishes to be cool and distant and yet still utterly lovable. \n\n\u201cThe acclaim also felt like part of the performance itself, the best part, and the most pure expression of what I was trying to do, which was to make myself into this kind of person: someone worthy of praise, worthy of love.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that we need to allow ourselves to be known to be truly loved. It is this refusal to submit to intimacy that becomes the primary conflict of the book; in her relationship with Bobbi, with Nick, and even with Melissa, she constantly attempts (with increasing desperation) to allow any breaking of her walls. It is only as the book continues that she begins to understand others do love her, and want to know her. This is a book made up of tiny moments of humanity, of vulnerability and tenderness. We see these characters hold up their walls at almost every moment to the point that any moment of tenderness or kindness between them feels like a revelation. I cried several times, barely knowing why; I just knew I hurt for these characters. This one will stay with me for a long, long time.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube", "This was stupidly good. After recently loving Rooney's sophomore novel Normal People my expectations for Conversations With Friends were high, though I was also a bit wary; in these situations I'm always afraid an author's debut isn't going to live up. I needn't have worried. This was perfect from start to finish. You know that feeling when you miss a stair and your stomach lurches briefly before you land - this was that sensation in book form.Once again I was impressed with Rooney's writing; it's simple and seemingly effortless, but the kind of natural and conversational cadence she achieves is no easy feat. The simultaneous intelligence and lack of life experience of the narrator, Frances, were captured so convincingly; from the start this was a person that I wanted to understand, whose head I wanted to inhabit briefly. Sally Rooney writes about interpersonal dynamics with such skill and ease and sharp observation, and that was the shining point of this novel, but whenever Frances looked inward, those moments were also captured with the same unnerving clarity. I related to Frances and I didn't; I saw bits of myself in her and I found bits of her unreachable. But Rooney made me care, she earned my investment as I watched with sympathy and frustration and anxiety as Frances attempted to navigate an awkward, ill-thought-out affair with an older married man, a dynamic which only complicated her limited understanding of love, class, status, artistic freedom, and belonging.If you can't handle books about unlikable, selfish people, you aren't going to enjoy this, and in that sense alone I don't necessarily believe this book transcends its premise. It's about unlikable, selfish people, many of whom are blind to their privilege. It's not about the kind of people you want to be, or want to be friends with. But if you're willing to sacrifice likability for realism, and an unpredictable plot for moments of startling self-reflection, this is the book for you. I actually ended up preferring this to Normal People, but both are a solid 5 stars and I am simply delighted that Sally Rooney's books have entered my life.", "**2 STARS***shoulder shrug* Unfiltered review https://wp.me/p7ZSCH-3dCReading the synopsis of the book had me excited. I just knew I was going to love this book. It sounded like I was going to get a little bit of YA and NA combined into one brilliant masterpiece. Sadly, for me, that did not happen.I want to start with the first and deepest reason why I never connected with this book. It\u2019s a big one, lovers.There are no quotation marks. It was extremely annoying reading a book when I couldn\u2019t tell if a character is actually talking to someone or if there\u2019s some inner dialogue going one. Half the time I didn\u2019t know who was talking. Let me give you a quick example and you can decide for yourself.\n\nBobbi, I said. Does my face look shiny?Bobbi glanced back and scrunched up her eyes to inspect me.Yeah, a little bit, she said.I let the air out of my lungs quietly. There wasn\u2019t anything I could do now anyway since I was on the stairs already. I wished I hadn\u2019t asked.Not in a bad way, she said. You look cute, why?\n\nIt was the most distracting thing to deal with in the entire book. I can respect an author\u2019s desire to be different or to try something new but this, no quotation thing was way too much for me. As an avid reader, I severely dislike loads of grammatical errors. A few here and there are not a problem but too many bothers the shit out of me. If I were the editor for this book I would have advised the author on the 100 different ways why, whatever that thing was, was a silly, silly, silly idea.I know that I often have many grammatical errors in my blog post, but I\u2019m not a professional writer and my husband is my \u201ceditor\u201d, so I don\u2019t really care. If I were to write an actual book, trust me when I say that I would pay a great deal of money for a professional editor with a great reputation to edit the shit out of my book.Not once did I feel connected with the characters. It was like sitting through a movie when the actors were complete shit. The main character, Frances's, lack of self esteem and self loathing was too much. Everything about her was flat. I couldn\u2019t care less about her life if I tried. Everything about the way her character was written was very stoic and mater-of-fact.Not once did I see an exclamation point. Every sentence ended in either with a period or question mark. There was no passion for the words. This went on for the entire book. I was so bored. Three hundred page of detached and impassive words.All in all, this book wasn\u2019t for me and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for any of my reading friends, ever. I wish the author great success in the future.Oh, shit, I forgot to let you know if I liked the story. No, I did not. It was odd and unbelievable \u2013 that could have been down to the writing as well. If I wasn\u2019t asked to read and review this book from the publisher, I would not have finished it.", "\nThis book is incredible! Read it in one day.\n", "Audiobook... read by Alice McMahonThe audio-narration was wonderfully alive an addictive. Granted this isn\u2019t exactly a book a parent would ever recommend to their young adult- 20-ish old child - daughter or son...as this is not an educational book on inspiring relationships \u2014 But for me \u2014 as a 66 year old married fart who values honesty- with little-to-zero respect for adultery...( consented is up to the couple -\u2018lies\u2019- destroy others)....Regardless.....I enjoyed the \u2018conversations\u2019.. the funny/ sensual scenes, and all the drama. I felt Rooney\u2019s dialogue flowed so well -- it didn\u2019t drive me into my head - my body simply absorbed the telling of this story. Some books are selfishly for ourselves - as this one turned out to be for me.I won\u2019t even begin to try to intellectualize why I liked it... but I did! I\u2019m won\u2019t recommend it to most people..because for starters I don\u2019t usually recommend books about messy \u2018affairs\u2019 ...But I gotta share \u2014 I laughed silly when I was in the hospital parking garage looking for a parking spot listening to a sex scene...when Frances ( the narrator) says to Nick the night of their first \u2018cheating\u2019 Rondevoo ( he\u2019s married)........it was the first time she had sex with A MAN, too...Frances says to Nick:\u201cBoy, I\u2019m sure I liked that more than you did\u201d.... I laughed so hard - I missed an available parking spot!! This is one of those artsy, sexy- literary/naughty- books about young relationships with all the things you DON\u2019T want YOUR daughter mixed up in. Shhhh, I LOVED IT!!!", "My full review, as well as my other thoughts on reading, can be found on my blog.Compelling and cool,\u00a0Conversations with Friends\u00a0places millennial malaise and an unexpected love affair against the backdrop of summertime Dublin. The fast-paced plot follows a pair of privileged college-aged performance poets and exes, Bobbi and Frances, as they become entangled with an older, slightly famous married couple, Nick and Melissa. The bulk of the story concerns the rise and fall of Nick and Frances's romance. The two flirt by messenger, bonding over their shared lack of direction, armchair socialism, and sharp wits; Frances soon has sex for the first time with Nick, the two vacation at a French beach house, and, inevitably, Melissa discovers and cooly responds to the affair. The fallout is messy and strange. Interestingly, the drama of the story is overshadowed by the novel's incisive dialogue. The conversations Frances has with Bobbi, Nick, and Melissa assume a variety of forms\u2014 furtive email messages, muted face-to-face interactions, rushed texts\u2014and the characters muse about everything from love under late capitalism to the merits of anarchism. The rapid conversations, along with Rooney's exhilarating prose, make the novel move at a dizzying pace. Well worth reading.", "I have spent the last days periodically exclaiming \u201cGod, what a book\u201d (or more correctly, because I do speak German in my real life, \u201cGott, was ein Buch!\u201d or \u201cDieses Buch!\u201d). I am feeling vaguely guilty for having given other books five stars because this book is just so much more than most of those. I am in no way objective in my absolute adoration and I don\u2019t think I can adequately articulate how very brilliant I thought this was, so stick with me while I squeal and talk in superlatives.I dragged my feet reading this book because the reviews are all over the place and it could have been so obnoxious (and some people think it is!): I mean, a book focussing on four fairly privileged young people making themselves miserable? A book where a thirty-something married man starts an affair with a 20-year-old college student? But this book hit me in all the right places. Rooney expertly weaves her tale, her characterization is sharp enough to cut, and her protagonist is a flawed piece of brilliance. Frances grounds this story in a way that worked exceedingly well for me and I found her, while infuriating, insanely relatable and incredibly true to life. Other reviewers have characterized her as unlikable \u2013 but I could not disagree more. She behaves stupidly, sure, but she is also lost and sad and sharply book smart while lacking emotional intelligence and I found her so very compelling. She is both the more active part of the relationship while also letting things just happen without taking action. She is incapable of communicating effectively while still being observant.Rooney also manages something incredible here: she made me feel for the thirty-year-old man sleeping with a much younger woman and lying to his wife. Nick could have been a walking clich\u00e9, but Rooney made him so much more well-rounded while never flinching away from the fact that he behaves atrociously. Every single one of the four main characters felt real in a way that fictional characters so rarely do, precisely because Rooney lets them be contradictory and, yes, sometimes unpleasant. But for me this unpleasantness never overshadowed the sympathy I felt for all of them.I cannot see this book not topping my best of the year list, which on the one hand is great, on the other hand it is only March and I have a whole lot Women\u2019s Prize reading ahead of me. I will read everything Rooney had ever written or will ever write, starting with Normal People when it\u2019ll arrive this weekend. On reread:Still a perfect book.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.", "Okay, I think this book might have worked better for me if I'd read it before Elif Batuman's The Idiot. Batuman and Rooney give their narrators similar voices: sharp, clear and deadpan but excessively self-aware. Both use email conversations to map out the development of a relationship. Both novels are told from the perspective of naive, supposedly intelligent young women who appear largely passive, falling into particular courses of action more because of the lack of a viable alternative than any great impetus on their part. When I say 'supposedly intelligent' here I'm really only referring to Rooney's Frances: she seems little more than a poser when juxtaposed with Batuman's protagonist Selin, who is imbued with such palpable intellectual power that her observations and ideas crackle off the page.The plot follows Frances and Bobbi, her best friend and ex-girlfriend, as they become entangled with an alluring older couple. Initially this is mainly because Bobbi is pursuing Melissa, an artist, but soon Frances enters into an affair with Nick, Melissa's actor husband. The whole story is told from Frances' point of view. This is a character-driven novel, and for me, the characters were the problem. On a personal level, I hated (most of) them; on a critical level I felt they lacked the necessary depth to make the plot work (in particular, I did not believe in Melissa and Nick as a thirtysomething married couple). When I think about it, Frances is true to a lot of what I remember about being 21 \u2013 her thoughts are self-absorbed, self-flagellating and gullible, her conversations filled with mildly endearing intellectual posturing and what a Twitter friend of mine once memorably referred to as 'performative wokeness' \u2013 but for whatever reason, she made me roll my eyes with exasperation rather than feel nostalgic for that period of my own life.In contrast to the likes of The Idiot and Stephanie Danler's Sweetbitter, which offer fresh, provocative and delightful reinterpretations of the coming-of-age plot, Conversations with Friends is the sort of book that makes me think maybe I should stop reading fiction about people younger than me. Almost everyone in it is irredeemably narcissistic, pretentious and nowhere near as smart as they think they are. I wanted to slap Frances and punch Nick. The disproportionate ire aimed at stories about women who have affairs has long been a pet hate of mine, but in this case, I could find absolutely no sympathy for Frances and just felt irritated every time she got bogged down in her emotional distress over Nick. Unfortunately, this makes up an awful lot of the book.The narrative is always best when it moves away from Frances and Nick's relationship. An episode in which Frances is taken to hospital is lucidly realised, and in general Rooney's descriptions of sickness and pain are powerful. Bobbi is intriguing, though the tight focus on Frances doesn't quite allow enough room for the reader to see the charismatic figure other characters treat her as. (I'd have preferred the story \u2013 or at least part of it \u2013 to be told from Bobbi's perspective.) So yeah \u2013 I loved Rooney's writing here, she's so talented, and incredibly young to have written a novel so poised and polished. Despite the issues I had with Conversations with Friends, I'm really looking forward to reading more from her. I just hope she writes about less insufferable people next time.I received an advance review copy of Conversations with Friends from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr", "Very, very strong, though I prefer the ping-ponging perspectives of the wonderful NORMAL PEOPLE. Rooney has such an uncanny knack for love squares and cliffhangers, and you'll fly through this, as I did. Her affectless prose is startling, though CWF has a few linguistic flourishes, especially toward the end, that slightly imbalance the text. She is a master of plot, of the importance of gestures, and desire. The one other thing about this book is that the lead repeatedly makes the same mistake in each of the 4 plot centers (health, father, ex-gf, potential bf) of the novel - she doesn't communicate. Though this is a consistent character trait, I found myself wishing for a bit more variety. I see why this debut brought Rooney attention - she's a star.", "5 Stars.Entanglements, my oh my!\u201cConversations with Friends\u201d by Sally Rooney had me ALMOST from the get go. At first, admittedly, I wondered WHAT in HECK, I was listening too. Frances\u2026 rambling on about her goings on\u2026 her trysts with her school friend Bobbi.. which went from steamy to platonic very quickly. Frances\u2019s description of her and Bobbi\u2019s poetry readings and a woman named Melissa\u2019s immediate intrigue in them and then BOOM. Somewhere along the way I began listening with interest, which then became curiosity and fascination. The moment Nick, Melissa\u2019s husband appeared, I was completely hooked. Sally Rooney has a way of luring me in. Drawing me in, in a way where I can\u2019t pull myself away. The relationships in this novel are extremely complicated. Though there should be a sense of right and wrong, somehow there isn\u2019t. Looks exchanged.. feelings enmeshed, acts completed. There is no finality here. I read Sally Rooney\u2019s \u201cNormal People\u201d before this and once again, I\u2019m left feeling unsettled, wondering about the characters.  I will say that I smiled when the audiobook ended. I was happy with where it left off and yet, I was a bit on edge, thinking \u201cno, don\u2019t,\u201d all the while thinking \u201cyes please.\u201d  Somehow Sally Rooney has this ability to leave me in a place where I am conflicted and I love it. \u201cConversations with Friends\u201d is a character driven novel that immediately grabbed my attention and had me glued to the audiobook. The narration by Alice McMahon was stellar and I applaud Sally Rooney for her brilliantly written novel. I anxiously await what she comes up with next. Thank you to my local library for lending me this fabulous novel.Published on Goodreads on 1.25.19.", "Conversations with Friends (the title and sunny cover are fairly misleading) is a stark, reflective novel which asks the reader to inhabit the mind of 21 year old poet and college student, Frances. She appears to be coolly detached from her feelings, at least in the beginning, and analytical to the point of neurosis.We get a sense of Frances' excruciating self-consciousness at the start of the novel, when she and her ex-girlfriend Bobbi are invited back to the home of Melissa, a \"slightly famous\" writer/photographer they've just met. In the taxi, Frances is \"ready for the challenge of visiting a stranger's home, already preparing compliments and certain facial expressions to make myself seem charming\". Upon arriving, she makes a point of deciding to \"remember everything about her home, so I could describe it to our other friends later and Bobbi could agree\". The novel follows her and her artsy circle from poetry readings to dinner parties to a holiday at a beach house in France. The plot, such as it is, mainly deals with sexual entanglements and jealousies within the group. These characters are disconnected, both emotionally and in the literal, digital sense. Tinder makes a brief appearance, and there's one mention of Facebook, but otherwise this book could almost be set at any time in the past 20 years. Communication is via email and instant messaging, and there's no sense of the hyper connected, social media-fuelled world we live in now. Presumably this was deliberate (the author is 25), but it just feels anachronistic and at odds with the book's realism. Frances' musings are alternately mundane, lambent, and pretentious, as befits a young person with more intelligence than experience. It's not clear whether she's become any wiser by the end, for all her introspection, but I guess that's not the point. It's more about exploring the nature of relationships and the power dynamics within them. This novel, like its characters, is pessimistic and aloof, as well as incisive and real. Unnerving, and occasionally scraping close to the bone, and you've got to respect writing that can achieve that.", "I really admire Sally Rooney\u2019s writing. Her stories aren\u2019t perfect, just like her characters, but they feel very authentic.", "I received this book for free through LibraryThing\u2019s Early Reviewers.This book gave me so many feels. It was a roller coaster of emotions. For some reason I really connected to this book. There was something so captivating about it. I felt like this book would make a great movie or miniseries on HBO. There's something really special and different about it that would translate well to the screen.The characters felt very real and I think that's what I liked most about it. I loved Nick. He was so different from what I had expected. Overall, I'm obsessed with this book. ", "This book revolves around two college students in Dublin named Frances and Bobbi and their relationship with Melissa & Nick who are a married couple they meet early in the story. It is told from the point of view of Frances which at times can be described as very matter-of-factly and at other times as very introspective. A lot of the interactions happened by email which I thought was a bit strange since nowadays most people communicate by text. I mean, there were some texts but a large part of the interactions happened by email. I think that two of the main themes of this book are loneliness and the need to connect to other people. The main character attended literary events often and was generally noticing the artsy stuff around her, for example, at one time she noted a \"Toulouse-Lautrec poster\" at her home, art items like this were mentioned often. Overall I had a hard time connecting to the main character. Although things happened throughout, I do not feel that Frances grew or accomplished something after the events in the book. I enjoy reading about self-centered, unlikeable characters but they have to be interesting which was not the case for me.  \nThanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.\nReview also posted on \nblog\n", "\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-one, said Melissa. You should be disastrously unhappy.I\u2019m working on it, I said.\u201dConversations Among Friends by Sally Rooney I listened to because\u2014conversations, talk, duh\u2014and because I had just read and taught her second book, Normal People. I have to say I loved both books, but I am also quick to say that the central female character in each book is very similar, physically quite a bit like what Rooney appears to looks like. The two main characters share some deeply concerning personality characteristics that made me stop and want to text Rooney to see if she was not in fact sending us all a cry-for-help message in these books about her own self-destructive tendencies. I know, I know about that author/narrator fallacy. Books of fiction may not necessarily reveal anything at all about the author, but it gave me pause, I tell you. In this one Frances\u2014as did Marianne in Normal People\u2014seems na\u00efve, lost, ever losing herself, disappearing into herself, involved in self-damaging sexual behavior, at the same time making shallow precocious college girl feminist/anti-capitalist critiques of the very social swamps she swims in. We really do, I promise you, come to like these women, as we can see how vulnerable and lost they are. Young women, coming of age without a map, without a guide.You can read thousands of other reviews for better plot summaries, but the story here is that college student Frances, recently dumped by her girlfriend Bobbi but still her best friend, is not working and writing a little and involved in witty conversations with people she knows about feminism and very involved in various social media, performing at local spoken word events with Bobbi. Frances meets a (married) actor and has an affair with him, her first sex with a man. She\u2019s 21, he is 32. Somewhere along the way Frances and Bobbi are invited to France by Nick and Melissa for a summer vacation. Nick is a pretty successful actor, Melissa is a pretty successful photographer, Bobbi and Frances are college poets and they don\u2019t seem to do much all day but text each other. So this is a portrait of academic/class privilege, of young people not knowing what they are doing, damaging others, damaging each other, taking themselves altogether too seriously.Not convinced yet? Hmm, let\u2019s see. The people remind me a bit of Whit Stillman\u2019s send-up of rich Manhattanites, Metropolitan, and a little bit of The Sun Also Rises, where all the people \u201cbehave badly\u201d toward each other. But I still love Frances, in part thanks to Rooney\u2019s wonderful writing about this young woman learning how to develop actual friendships, learning how to have sex as a part of a relationship, things she knows almost nothing about, as witty and sleek and pretty as she is. It\u2019s really, like Normal People, a coming-of-age story featuring two precocious girls living rent-free in space their parents provide for them, and talking smack about rich people while destroying a marriage in the process. Along the way Frances develops endrometriosis and observes:\u201cI realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn\u2019t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn\u2019t make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful. Nothing would.\u201dWill Frances learn from her mistakes and find rue love and friendship and become actually nice and usefully self-reflective? Well, let me tell you, I just loved the final scene, with Frances outside talking to Nick on the phone, freezing, leading up to the last really surprising and confusing line that implicated me, at least, in the story, and revealed (to me) my being emotionally invested in the story, after all. I had heard (which made me not want to read it, a couple years ago) that Rooney had described her first novel, the first draft written of which was written when she was 15, as \u201cabsolute trash\u201d but I have to say she\u2019s wrong, she doesn't know what she's talking about, it is really, really good!! (Or maybe she's talking about the sex scenes, which are for what its worth, really good even if you can't approve of it on some level?). Two books by Sally Rooney in one year, and I am completely a fan, and this review hasn\u2019t really convinced you!! Maybe I\u2019ll try harder later to get at why I love her wry, understated, compassionate style so much.", "Meah, blah, I'm giving up, I've already spent too much time in the company of these characters. I don't mind unlikable characters, I don't have an issue with sexual fluidity or cheating (as in I don't need a trigger warning, it doesn't prevent me from reading a novel). In saying all that, the characters were insufferable, vacuous, bland, and the writing didn't agree with me at all. In my year of reading mostly chick -lit, I created a GR shelf Im-So-Over-First-Person-Narratives. This novel belonged there, too bad I deleted that said shelf. ", "A review in The New Yorker, and, if I'm honest, a shared surname, led me to this book even though without those two things just listed, I could tell this wasn't my kind of book. The main character is twenty-one but I have placed this on my 'adolescence' shelf because in so many ways she seemed to enjoy one of those long, extended adolescences that Americans have perfected by putting their kids through college, and then grad school in a field where a degree will get you a job in a non-profit working out of a third world country. And of course, keeping these grads on their health insurance until they've paid off their $200K in college loans. But I digress...This is a story in which one of these two adolescent friends thinks it is a good idea to have an affair with a married man (always a bad idea...sorry guys) and unfortunately thinks it is likewise a bright idea to carry on the romance by email late at night. My stomach began to roil, and then recoil...at the utter stupidity of this until her juvenile back-and-forth with her girlfriend literally sent me over the edge. Both girls are living free in space their parents provide and then talk about how they loathe people with money. See what a mean about adolescent? I.just.can't.read.this. Got to pg. 90. Liked one description along the way: \"I felt like I was playing a video game without knowing any of the controls.\"", "\nWonderful - funny, smart and sad - not much happens in this book, but it's a joy to spend time with these difficult, intelligent and sometimes unpleasant people.\n", "\n3.5*** \n", "On a vacation to Portland, Maine, a few weeks ago, I visited two independent bookstores that both had the newly released paperback of Conversations with Friends featured in their displays of bookseller recommendations. Although up to then I'd been unsure if I'd read this novel, I decided to heed the two endorsements and bought a copy at one of the stores. Perhaps this experience predisposed me to like the book, but like it I definitely did.I won't rehash the plot here but will just say that Conversations with Friends is about two college-age friends (and former lovers), Frances (the narrator) and Bobbi, who befriend and become entangled with a thirtysomething married couple, Melissa and Nick. I thought the way Rooney developed these characters was extraordinary. She performed that elusive stunt wherein we see everyone through the narrator's eyes, but learn enough about all the characters to form our own opinions of them--including of Frances herself, who is definitely no objective observer. Some of the insights into character this novel imparts were a bit close for comfort, as when a character claims she doesn't have a \"real personality\" and only gets clues to what kind of person she is in retrospect, or when a character remarks that Frances sees herself as powerless and therefore doesn't really believe she can hurt people the way other people can hurt her. Both of these sentiments would have described me when I was college-age, and I wish I'd had someone (or this book!) to make me aware of them at the time. I know a lot of reviews have called these characters unlikable, but I didn't really find them unlikable, and I also don't think it was Rooney's intention for us to like them, which makes all the difference.Beyond that, the book just pulled me in. Conversations with Friends is a perfect title, because although plenty happens in this novel, it really did just feel like spending time with Frances and the other characters in her orbit. As in life, even dramatic events don't necessarily result in a ton of drama; everyone absorbs what happens and attempts to fumble through in their own way. The result was something with a quiet but undeniable emotional impact.I mostly liked the writing style, although I suppose it was occasionally a bit self-conscious. The last scene, with Frances wandering around Dublin talking on the phone, getting colder and colder, leading up to the last (surprising!) line, left me seriously impressed and anxious to read something else by Rooney. Like most novels, Conversations with Friends isn't for everyone, but it was certainly for me. I agree with the booksellers of Portland: This was excellent.", "\nNope, not my kind of book. Bored by the story, and the writing style didnt do it for me either.\n", "An uncomfortable read that sucks you into the sometimes bleak world of the narrator and shows what it's like to grow up in the modern day world... and I felt sorry for all of us, like we were just little children pretending to be adults.Our narratorBobbi told me she thought I didn\u2019t have a \u2018real personality\u2019, but she said she meant it as a compliment. Mostly I agreed with her assessment. At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterwards think: oh, so that\u2019s the kind of person I am.Four people are followed in various states of relationships to each other. Frances is our narrator who together with Bobbi, her tough lesbian ex, does spoken word performances. Here she meets Nick, an actor, and Melissa, who together form a married creative couple (although I can hardly recall what Melissa does in day to day life).Frances is how someone could portray a stereotypical millennial: besides doing spoken word for a living, she calls herself a communist with the ambition not to earn more than the average income of the world (but is nonetheless quite impressed with Melissa and Nick their house), she is bisexual, seems to spend all her time at book launch events or at the college feminist society.She reads A Critique of Postcolonial Reason for fun at night and has quasi deep chats about being \"anti love, as such\".Despite this, Frances says overdramatic, almost teenager like things as: \"Have you ever said one sincere thing in your life?\" to her love interest. And she also has genuine self doubt, one thought of her is for instance: I looked like something that had dropped off a spoon too quickly, before it had time to set.I remember the late night conversations and chats I had as a teenager, and how everything that the other person said was picked apart by me for meanings in meanings. And how you\u2019d talk and talk, but truly conveying what you wanted to say eluded you nonetheless. As in Normal People I think Sally Rooney pulls of making an unsympathetic, slightly morally gray character feel real, very skillfully.At one point she twirls her hair in knots that break off, and that small detail made her feel very human and real, because I recognize that small habit from myself. And at a certain point we have Frances musing:I knew that intellectual attainment was morally neutral at best, but when bad things happened to me I made myself feel better by thinking about how smart I was.In general I could relate so well to Frances, even though she was annoying and immature at times, because she felt so much like a real human.ThemesConversations with Friends is filled with lot\u2019s of communication per emails, msn, Timder and looking up love interests on Youtube and Netflix. At one point I just thought: \"Why do these people not just call each other instead of bickering on instant messenger\", and at times the conflicts feel a bit constructed. Besides the setting in the now (with references to Zelda games and the Arab spring) and some class struggle observations from the perspective of Frances, we have a lot of themes going on. Overall I found the book therefor not really a quick read; it packs a lot in slightly over 300 pages.We have the care for a drunk father who is on the path of self destruction, illustrated in a visceral scene with maggots in mayonnaise and flies everywhere. The fear of pregnancy and abortion in the context of the Irish law (that apparently only changed in 2018 in this respect) and later on living with something incurable pop up.There are some feelings of wanting to be sexually subjugated.We have some light (if that is a good term for it) automutilation and some heavy feels of psychological instability and people who have full fledged psychiatrical depressions.To put it mildly, Conversation with Friends does not feel very uplifting despite the colourful cover, and becomes a bit too top heavy and constructed by too many heavy themes at some points. This also makes it a rich book, certainly when realizing this is a debut of a twentysomething writer.RelationshipsIn the core, all of the characters have troubles with vulnerability. There is an overarching fear of living life alone, and not being the number one to anyone, even their parents. It almost reminded me in this respect to the feeling Norwegian Wood gave me.I think the best scene that illustrates the overall focus on the exterior, and the lack of true engagement with the interior, was when Bobbi said to Frances, who asks for help, that she doesn't have time for her because she wants to watch a documentary on human rights abuses in Algeria.Building on the above, everyone in Conversations with Friends has problems and seems lonely, talks down on themself and wants to be a nicer person (If I was the person i wanted to be  is a thought that comes back a few times). And again, if these people just talked to each other, there would not be much of a plot at all, and quite a lot more happy people. Perhaps anachronistically in our modern world, the extramarital affair of Nick and Frances made me feel slightly uncomfortable, partly due to the age difference and the awkwardness of Frances interacting with his wife during the affair. Nick overall is just called handsome all the time, in a bit too much tell kind of manner, but gains some depth through the book when we zoom into his medical history. Not much emotion is outspoken, but overall I found him a decent person, despite being a bit overly passive. In the end I kind of got their relationship:I loved when he was available to me like this, when our relationship was like a Word document which we were writing and editing together, or a long private joke which nobody else could understand.The other good friend of Frances, Bobbi, comes less to the forefront. As a reader you observe her more based on her behavior than on explicit statements from herself. I had a tough time understanding what the appeal of Bobbi was, besides her confidence? She rarely seems to spare a thought for another person and occasionally came across as really unkind. We do have a touching scene of the both of them being young and kicked out of the Tesco because they read out aloud embarrassing passages from the Men\u2019s health. But I felt her as a character and love interest to Frances much less.ConclusionThe quality of Normal People, Rooney's second book, is that all the mundane, the wine drinking, socialising, diners and smoking, are skipped due to the structure of the novel, only focussing on pivotal moments. In Conversations with Friends this is not the case: for instance, I thought the whole excursion to France part took forever.Before part two of the book I felt this would end at a between two and three star book. Fortunately the pace picked up, and I want to quote two phrases at the end of the book that tie in neatly with why I think Conversations with Friends is a solid four star book overall:Gradually the waiting began feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.You live through certain things before you understand them. You can\u2019t always take the analytical position.", "Talking \u2019bout My Generation?Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award shortlist review #2(I am on the official shadow panel of book bloggers.)(Nearly 4.5) The first thing to note about a novel with \u201cConversations\u201d in the title is that there are no quotation marks denoting speech. In a book so saturated with in-person chats, telephone calls, texts, e-mails and instant messages, the lack of speech marks reflects the swirl of voices in twenty-one-year-old Frances\u2019 head; thought and dialogue run together. This is a work in which communication is a constant struggle but words have lasting significance.It\u2019s the summer between years at uni in Dublin, and Frances is interning at a literary agency and collaborating with her best friend (and ex-girlfriend) Bobbi on spoken word poetry events. She\u2019s the ideas person, and Bobbi brings her words to life. At an open mic night they meet Melissa, an essayist and photographer in her mid-thirties who wants to profile the girls. She invites them back for a drink and Frances, who is from a slightly rough background \u2013 divorced parents and an alcoholic father who can\u2019t be relied on to send her allowance \u2013 is dazzled by the apparent wealth of Melissa and her handsome actor husband, Nick. Bobbi develops a crush on Melissa, and before too long Frances falls for Nick. The stage is set for some serious amorous complications over the next six months or so.Young woman and older, married man: it may seem like a clich\u00e9, but Sally Rooney is doing a lot more here than just showing us an affair. For one thing, this is a coming of age in the truest sense: Frances, forced into independence for the first time, is figuring out who she is as she goes along and in the meantime has to play roles and position herself in relation to other people:At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterwards think: oh, so that\u2019s the kind of person I am.I couldn\u2019t think of anything witty to say and it was hard to arrange my face in a way that would convey my sense of humour. I think I laughed and nodded a lot.What will be her rock in the uncertainty? She can\u2019t count on her parents; she alienates Bobbi as often as not; she reads the Gospels out of curiosity but finds no particular solace in religion. Her other challenge is coping with the chronic pain of a gynecological condition. More than anything else, this brings home to her the disappointing nature of real life:I realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn\u2019t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn\u2019t make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful. Nothing would.Rooney writes in a sort of style-less style that slips right down. There\u2019s a flatness to Frances\u2019 demeanor: she\u2019s always described as \u201ccold\u201d and has trouble expressing her emotions. I recognized the introvert\u2019s risk of coming across as aloof. Before I started this I worried that I\u2019d fail to connect to a novel about experiences so different from mine. I was quite the strait-laced teen and married at 23, so I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to relate to Frances and Bobbi\u2019s \u2018wildness\u2019. But this is much more about universals than it is about particulars: realizing that you\u2019re stuck with yourself, exploring your sexuality and discovering that sex is its own kind of conversation, and deciding whether \u2018niceness\u2019 is really the same as morality.With its prominent dialogue and discrete scenes, I saw the book functioning like a minimalist play, and I could also imagine it working as an on-location television miniseries. In some ways the dynamic between Frances and Bobbi mirrors that between the main characters in \nPaulina and Fran\n by Rachel B. Glaser, \nFriendship\n by Emily Gould, and \nThe Animators\n by Kayla Rae Whitaker, so if you enjoyed any of those I highly recommend this, too. Rooney really captures the angst of youth:You\u2019re twenty-one, said Melissa. You should be disastrously unhappy.I\u2019m working on it, I said.This is a book I was surprised to love, but love it I did. Rooney is a tremendous talent whose career we\u2019ll have the privilege to watch unfolding. I\u2019ve told the shadow panel that if we decide our focus is on the \u201cYoung\u201d in Young Writer, there\u2019s no doubt that this nails the zeitgeist and should win.Originally published, with images, on my blog, Bookish Beck.", "\nI even began searching my emails and texts for \u201cevidence\u201d of our affairThat night I decided to start reading over my old instant message conversations with Bobbi \u2026. It comforted me to know that my friendship with Bobbi wasn\u2019t confined to memory alone, and that textual evidence of her past fondness for me would survive her actual fondness if necessaryOur [Frances and Nick\u2019s] relationship was like a word document which we were writing and editing together\nSally Rooney is a 26 year old debut novelist \u2013 with a back story which included being the number one competitive debater in Europe.https://thedublinreview.com/article/e...This is her first novel. Frances (the 21 year old first person narrator) and Bobbi were lovers when 17 having met at high school, and, as (Trinity College Dublin) University students still remain very close friends, performing spoken word poetry together (with the more reserved Frances as writer and the provocative and more charismatic Bobbi as the lead performer). At an event a literary website writer Melissa (married to a moderately well-known and strikingly good looking actor Nick) approaches them and proposes she writes (and illustrates with photos) a profile of them. The group of four start to meet frequently together \u2013 Melissa and Bobbi immediately strike a bond of mutual fascination, while somewhat relegated to the background Nick and Melissa end up chatting, which quickly move through flirtation, online and phone sexually charged conversations, a seemingly one-off sexual encounter, and then a full flown affair (which starts when the two students join the married couple, and some of their friends, on vacation at a large house in France). The affair is complicated by the other strands of the \u201cm\u00e9nage \u00e0 quatre\u201c \u2013 Frances and Bobbi\u2019s past and current bonds, Bobbi and Melissa\u2019s mutual fascination, Melissa and Nick\u2019s marriage (with Melissa as the dominant character and Nick a passive player). It is played out not just through sex, but through conversations, phone calls, computer messaging, text and emails \u2013 an important aspect of the book and of Frances\u2019s view on relationships (as the quotes above imply). At times the technology can seem slightly age-inappropriate (Email and text seem to be the preferred communication media. Tinder and Facebook make only brief appearances, Snapchat/Instagram/selfies not at all).The affair also takes place against a background of Frances struggling with: a condition which she keeps hidden as far as she can, particularly form Nick, but turns out to be endometriosis; with a drunk and absent father for whom she has lost all feelings (albeit she is very happy to take his support payments) set alongside pressure from her separate mother to stay in contact with him; and with Frances\u2019s (clich\u00e9d but no less valid) worry about what commitment Nick as a married man, unprepared to leave his wife has to their relationship. She sporadically indulges in low level self-harm, and even tries to engage (fairly superficially it has to be said) with Jesus and his gospel message. We see little of Frances\u2019s poetry \u2013 which at one stage she describes as just writing and pressing the enter key frequently \u2013 or a Bobbi-inspired short story she writes (after she forgets to press the enter key for a long time).All this makes Frances while not a completely sympathetic character at least a partly deep one \u2013 as perhaps the biggest issue with this book is the superficiality of the other characters and their privileged, directionless lives.Of debating Rooney commented \u201cyou need to have a taste for ritualized, abstract interpersonal aggression\u201d \u2013 and \u201cyou must be clear in your attempts to get the better of the teams arguing the opposite side of the question, but subtle in undermining the other team that\u2019s arguing your side. It\u2019s against the rules to contradict them openly. Instead, you need to emphasize at every opportunity that your arguments are the more important.\u201d and she clearly transfers some of that approach to Bobbi. Whether this is meant to make Bobbi an interesting character I was unsure \u2013 she is described as charismatic \u2013 but I found her arguments immature with constant references to the overarching flaws in capitalism or patriarchal systems. A final observation on this book \u2013 neither praise nor criticism \u2013 is that, in my view very unusually for an Irish literary book, the Irish setting of this book has almost no impact, in fact it could easily have been set in London or East Coast US. Overall certainly an interesting debut by a young author writing with a fresh new voice about a young character experiencing a very old story (a woman having an affair with an older married man).", "\nThought provoking and honest, Conversations with Friends is a book nearly without flaws. I say nearly because Normal People by Sally Rooney is much stronger in terms of it's plot, and this book feels like the rough draft to her newest novel. That said, Rooney's style is unique and original, and I love how honestly flawed all of her characters are. And this story is a perfect representation of life: it's messy and unpredictable, and we are all just trying to find our footing.\n"], "genre": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Cultural", "Ireland", "Novels", "European Literature", "Irish Literature", "LGBT", "Audiobook", "Adult", "Romance"], "recommend": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/similar/52827120-conversations-with-friends", "avg_ratings": "3.81", "ShelvedNumber": "1683"}

Trevor Noah\u2019s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents\u2019 indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa\u2019s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man\u2019s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother\u2014his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother\u2019s unconventional, unconditional love.Source: penguinrandomhouse.ca", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911l/29780253.jpg", "title": "Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood", "authors": "Trevor Noah", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime", "reviews": ["I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart's successor on \nThe Daily Show\n. I inherently knew that they wouldn't pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart's, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he'd be able to tough it out and show the stuff\u2014comedic and otherwise\u2014of which he was made.After reading \nBorn a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood\n, I realize that I needn't have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media's eye, he'd have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!!\"On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations\u2014I was born a crime.\"Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn't be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn't walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way.\"She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.\"\nBorn a Crime\n provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn't white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah's day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It's also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other.More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends).I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on \nThe Daily Show\n. This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn't go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show\u2014other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap.I've heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah's story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn't heavy-handed; it's fun, insightful, and very compelling.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.", "This was fantastic.Born a Crime, at over six months, is the longest library hold I've ever waited for. Normally, if I hadn't already lost interest by that point, I'd just break down and buy it, but I'm generally not a big memoir reader, so I was reluctant to spend money on a book I wasn't sure would be my thing. Well, I've ended up buying it anyway. And my husband and I are currently laughing our way through the audio version, too.I just couldn't put this book down. There are many moments of comedy gold (that come across even better on audio, but still drew out-loud laughter when I read them in print) and lots of insight into what it was like growing up in South Africa under the later years of apartheid, and after its collapse (which I prefer reading in print so I can take my time to appreciate the gravity of the issues).Trevor Noah covers a lot of serious issues like colonialism, apartheid, being an outsider, religion, education, gender roles and more. He talks about how his mother - who comes across as the rugged heroine of his story - played the system well to get her illegal \"colored\" child into better schools and neighborhoods, and how this often led to him having difficulty fitting in. I learned things that, though perhaps not surprising, were horrifying, such as how police refused to file charges in cases of domestic violence because they sympathized with the husband. It's a book about important issues in a country that has, throughout history, largely been portrayed through the eyes of white journalists and writers, but it's also such a warm, lovable, funny book in many ways. Born a Crime is the perfect blend of sociopolitical discussion and a personal tale of family, friendship and first crushes. It is written as a series of short essays, each around a certain theme and not in chronological order, but this actually makes it all easier to digest. Noah's writing is so engaging that I would think \"just one more essay\" until suddenly a hundred pages had gone by and I realized I might be addicted.Definitely one of the best memoirs I've ever read.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "These stories, beautifully written, are set in a world quite like our own but at the same time utterly different. Maybe \"through a glass darkly\". Who goes to church three times on Sunday to Black, White and Coloured ones? Who goes to jail for (not) stealing a car rather than face the wrath of his mother? Who gets a prom date with the most beautiful girl around, but one who doesn't speak the language and is extremely unsociable to boot? None of these things are extraordinary in this world,Who could perform rap at a Jewish school to a wildly-enthusiastic audience and create deadening silence in one second asking respect for Hitler? Repeatedly. I'm not going to spoil this one. It's a brilliant story, very funny, and sadly critical too. Two worlds collide, black and white, and neither understand why the other is so offended. (view spoiler)[If you'd really like to know and aren't going to read the book, IM me. (hide spoiler)]In what world can a man standing in front of a policeman not be identified on the video they are both watching of his best friend shoplifting and he with him? But he isn't. Because of the exposure of the video the black figure appeared black but the coloured one, Trevor, appeared white. The police were unable to link in their heads the features of the man on the screen with the one in front of them who was a suspect, because he was white. These South African policemen were blinded by their prejudice. Which was rather lucky for Trevor, and he is our hero.He's mine anyway. This is a fascinating book that will take you deep into the world of the non-white life of South Africa mostly since apartheid ended. It's funny and tragic, heart-warming and wtf did you do that for. It's tribal and urban and mostly very third world. It's quite something to incorporate all those elements and boast only in ways that are more to do with accomplishment than with ego. But if you don't like politics this isn't for you. Every single incident no matter how funny, how light, and they aren't all, drives home that race decides everything in South Africa.  I listened to it in the car. The audio is brilliant. narrated by the author (which is why I got it on audio, that's one of the great advantages of the media listening to an author tell his own tale.) It's a 10-star biography. ", "If you're going to read this book, definitely listen to the audio version. Trevor Noah is one of the most effortless narrators I've ever listened to. It genuinely feels like he is sitting down with you and telling you his life story. Not only that, but you get to learn quite a bit about pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa from the perspective of someone who hypothetically shouldn't exist. Noah's mother is black and his father is white, and when he was born any mixed-race relationships were illegal. I was instantly intrigued by his story, not only because of this unique perspective but also because he is such a wonderful storyteller.I do think the chronology of the book was a bit strange at times\u2014one chapter would be from his childhood and then the next would jump to his teen years, and back. And at the end of each chapter there was always a short snippet that completely changed directions and had pretty much nothing to do with the previous chapter (maybe in the physical copy of the book that section is identifiably set apart?).Nonetheless, this was a great listening experience, one that was enlightening, hilarious, heartbreaking, frustrating and well told. Would highly recommend.", "Before I start my review, I want to take a minute to praise Trevor Noah's stand up shows because they're one of the few that don't rely on being ignorant. His shows are one of the enlighten ones focusing on race, white-privilege, police brutality, hate speech, prejudice, and so much more.I\u2019d highly recommend watching a few before reading this riveting memoir.\n\nIn Born a Crime, Trevor Noah takes us on a journey from his childhood being born a crime in apartheid South Africa. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. This memoir is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.Side note: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - his mother - was a powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense. She's a warrior and I only wish I could be a half of the person she is. Also, I love the advice she gave her son\u2014I even wrote a few pieces down to remember:\u201cAbel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He\u2019s attracted to independent women. \u201cHe\u2019s like an exotic bird collector,\u201d she said. \u201cHe only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.\u201dThis passage had pretty much changed the way I think, the way I precept the world.\u201cShe\u2019d tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: \u201cIf God is with me, who can be against me?\u201d She was never scared. Even when she should have been.\u201dThe piece stuck with me.Truly though, this memoir was enlighten, brimming with emotion, and I love it when children pay tribute to their hard-working mothers.\u201cThere was no stepfather in the picture yet, no baby brother crying in the night. It was me and her, alone. There was this sense of the two of us embarking on a grand adventure. She\u2019d say things to me like, \u201cIt\u2019s you and me against the world.\u201d I understood even from an early age that we weren\u2019t just mother and son. We were a team.\u201dMy mind and heart were fully transported while reading everything Trevor went through to get to where he is today and everyone that took part of that journey.And even though some of the stories kind of broke my heart, Trevor Noah always managed to bring in his gold humor to ease the tension. There are a couple of chapters that have taken a hold of my soul and won\u2019t let go because either they were extremely hilarious (TREVOR, PRAY & LOOPHOLES) or entirely heart-shattering (MY MOTHER\u2019S LIFE)... or both.Slowly and surely, I came to admire Trevor Noah's character and honesty even more than I did before.

If this book interests you, I urge you to listen to the audiobook!It was fascinating learning about his life growing up as a mixed race child in pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa. Though I learned vague facts about Apartheid in high school history classes, this was the best lesson I've had on the subject.The book skips around non-chronologically, which confused me at times as he introduces aspects of his earlier years later on in the story, but I remained captivated. I was so into it that, instead of working on the paper that's due soon or studying for my upcoming exam, I read this book in less than 24 hours. Worth it!I will say that this probably could have been a tad shorter as he has the tendency to repeat and over explain aspects, but I highly enjoyed it nonetheless.", "An audiobook *treasure*! Trevor is a likable! A charming- guy!!! Listening to him speak is almost magnetic. Being thrown out of a car? By his own mother? OUCH! Trevor had my attention in the palm of his hands. The ongoing - ongoing - and ONGOING ....dramatic stories Trevor shares about his childhood --were life lesson building blocks. Trevor did the building!! He used every life experience to his advantage-- and that's extraordinary! Poverty, abuse, Religious upbringing, crazy chaotic living conditions, a powerhouse one-of-kind mother....Trevor is a thriving survivor!!!!We also get an excellent intimate understanding: .....of the rigid former policy of segregating and economically and politically oppressing the non-white population....from the direct experience of Noah being born in South Africa during the laws of apartheid.A child who was often guided to play indoors, ( hiding), a 'positive' lifetime result 'today' is that Trevor says he can sit and enjoy his own company for days on out. He is never bored!.... sadness of course - tragic times -horrific injustice.....but Trevor Noah is warm - charming -filled with love and light!!!! Funny too!!!", "\nThe author is very charismatic and if you're going to read this book, I would recommend the audiobook since he narrates it!\n", "Five HUGE Stars for Trevor Noah's book! Believe the hype! I absolutely loved it. I listened to the audio. Trevor narrates his stories of growing up in South Africa. I highly recommend the audio version. He made this book come to life with his narration. This would actually make a good first listen.I just became a fan recently of his and thought I'd give the book a shot. I'm so happy I did! I learned a lot about apartheid and I learned a lot about South Africa. I also learned some gross facts like the poorest of people eat worms. At one point he and his family were so poor that they were eating them. Yuck! Trevor had me laughing. Trevor had me crying. Highly recommended to fans of his and/or people who just want to learn about life in South Africa during apartheid. Great book!", "This is great! I wasn\u2019t sure that I wanted to read it. A celebrity memoir by a mixed-race guy who was born in South Africa under apartheid didn\u2019t sound like it would be a smart, funny, and charming pleasure to read, but it is. Not that he minimizes the circumstances, but there more fact than lamentation. It\u2019s a shame about those people who don\u2019t enjoy audiobooks. His performance adds to fantastic storytelling.The stories from his childhood reminded me of something Art Linkletter said about the children chosen for the \u201cKids Say the Darndest Things\" segment of his show. \u201cIt asked the dear teachers to give us the four children they would most like to have out of the class for a few blessed hours. The teachers would laugh and send me the rascals.\u201d Not that that little Trevor was a bad kid, he is just one of those people that belong on a stage. He was a bit conflicted when exhorted to pray for God to kill the demon who had done the bad thing.\n\u201dDear Lord, please protect us, um, you know, from whoever did this, like, we don\u2019t know what happened exactly and maybe it was a big misunderstanding and, you know, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be quick to judge when we don\u2019t know the whole story and, I mean, of course you know best, Heavenly Father, but maybe this time it wasn\u2019t actually a demon, because who can say for certain, so maybe cut whoever it was a break\u2026\u201d\nI love his mother. Patricia Nombuyiselo NoahWhile this is Trevor's story, but it very much a loving tribute to her.", "When he took over from John Stewart I'll admit I stopped watching TDS; however, intermittently, I would come across Trevor's comedy shows online which would have me doubling over fighting for air (watch the \"Australian apple\" and \"Escalator\" skits), and within a short period, I became an even more ardent fan of TDS.In my opinion, Trevor is one of the most intelligent people on TV (or elsewhere) and this book shows us how he became the astute, authentic, resilient and insightful person that he now is. As an aside, special shout out to his Ma, Patricia, whom I understand will be played by Lupita in the upcoming movie adaptation, and while I like Lupita enough, I believe she is unsuited for this role as she herself must well know. South African women have a certain look which is def not Lupita and it would be a shame for Trevor to cede control of casting simply because she was the first person to contact him about movie options. Just saying.Overall,  Born a Crime is an important piece of literature that provides a young man's view of the effects of apartheid, the family dynamic that devolved from being born a crime, and the power of a mother's love. ", "\n\u201cI soon learned that the quickest way to bridge the race gap was through language.\u201d\nWhere do I even begin to explain how incredible this autobiography was?!Trevor Noah brought this story to life, but ultimately, it was his mother that was the main character, the MVP, of this book.You all know what this book is about: Trevor Noah is narrating his account on being raised in Apartheid South Africa. The issues growing up as a mixed-race child and a mother who defied all societal standard and called bullshit before anyone even dared do it. Colonialism. Poverty. Race. Living under a police state. Privilege. Whilst reading, I was aware these kind of ludicrous laws existed, but it still managed to shock me all over again. This was a world where interracial marriage was banned. Where Trevor could not be seen with either his mother or father. Where white people were put on such a pedestal, his grandmother refused to discipline him, because she \u2018didn\u2019t want to kill a white person.\u2019Where animosity was purposely sowed between people so the whites could be looked at for help. Yet, the blacks could never dream of getting to that social status. Where the American Dream was dangled in front of them. Though his world was completely different from our own, Trevor Noah still managed to make it relatable. His relationship with his mother was a delight to read. His desperation to fit in called to others. His first kiss. Trying to take the most beautiful girl to prom. Everything going disastrously wrong and beautifully twining that wisdom and lessons that he learned on the way. I just became enamoured with his mother though. The strength she possessed was almost not human. I\u2018m pretty sure it\u2019s not human. Her faith played a massive part in solidifying her personality and it was incredible to see her overcome troubles that would make others (me!) crumble with humour, love and Jesus. Trevor Noah is honestly a gem. We have his mother to thank for that. I highly recommend the audiobook for this. I didn\u2019t even touch the book once and it gave me hope in trying other audiobooks. It was completely engaging story, intimate, heartbreaking and provided you a front-seat view into Apartheid and what it did to the lives of others. I cannot wait for the movie adaptation!", "\n\u2018we tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.\u2019\nthis is one of the most touching love letters to a mother i have ever read. although this is presented as a collection of coming-of-age stories in a time where his existence was literally a crime, trevors words radiate pure and unconditional love for his mom. i am beyond humbled by the lessons trevors childhood taught him, his struggles, the way he see the world, how he treats others (especially women), and how his mom was there every step of the way. so heres to all the mothers who broaden our imaginations and give our dreams the space to soar. PS. i wholeheartedly regret not listening to this as an audiobook. i cant even imagine what an amazing experience it would be to hear trevor noah tells these stories personally. worthy of 100 stars, probably. \u21a0 5 stars", "\u201cLanguage, even more than color, defines who you are to people.\u201d Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood ~~ Trevor NoahTrevor Noah's BORN A CRIME is hilarious, heartbreaking and always told through a sympathetic lense. Noah moves from comedy to tragedy seamlessly. He understands the human condition better than most writers, no, most people. BORN A CRIME is one one of the best books I've read this year & maybe the best memoir I've ever read. BORN A CRIME is a book of fascinating tales from Noah's youth. He was born and raised in South Africa. Being born half white and half black, the birth of an \"illegal\" union, he is \"born a crime\". Noah's stories sketch his life, with his mother, in South Africa. BORN A CRIME deals with the horrors of both pre & post-apartheid South Africa. Noah's style is very matter-of-fact. He never downplays, nor does he embellish the tragedy of what South Africa was. Noah knew no other way of life and sees racism in all its many facets as a routine way of life. However, the book isn't just filled with tales of darkness and suffering. Noah brilliantly balances this tragedy with mayhem, mischief and love throughout his stories. BORN A CRIME is as much a loving memoir to Noah's mother, Patricia as it is his own story. Noah's love and respect for his mother and the way she raised him shines through on nearly every page. She knowingly broke apartheid laws designating it to be a crime for sexual intercourse between people of different races. Yet, she didn't care. With a man she loved, a Swiss man, she persuaded him to be the father to the child she so desperately wanted. Resulting from this crime was Trevor Noah ~~neither black nor white ~~ yet born into a world that hated him for the color of his skin. Noah credits his mother With shaping him into the man he is today. It\u2019s her discipline and loving heart that pushed Noah to succeed. BORN A CRIME begins and ends with Patricia's story. This is as much her story as it is Noah's. Noah\u2019s stories of his childhood and adolescence in this ever changing world cleverly avoid sermonizing. Instead, Noah describes a resilient and opportunistic boy whose intuitive street smarts lead him into a hustler\u2019s life. The ways in which Noah learns to navigate the changing world around him is worth the read itself.Along the way we learn of Noah's pooping in the kitchen and having to drive a demon out of the family home from that resulting poop, an abusive step-father, his early heart breaks with his first crushes, and his life as a music pirate ~~ it never occurred to Noah he was doing anything wrong, \"if copying CDs is wrong, why would they make CD writers?\u201d We learn of his run ins with the cops, and the tragedy that befell his mother. I definitely hope to read more of his work in the future. I loved seeing this world Trevor Noah's eyes.", "Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah is a 2016 Spiegel & Grau publication. I\u2019ve been a fan of Trevor Noah since he started hosting \u2018The Daily Show\u2019, but after reading this book, I\u2019m an even bigger fan. I admit I know virtually nothing about South Africa other than the absolute obvious, like what is reported in the news. So, Trevor gives readers like myself a bit of a history and a maybe a civics lesson too, in how people are divided by class and race and the thought process or mindset of those who live in this country. Noah is of mixed race, born right before the end of apartheid, which made his birth illegal because whites and blacks were not allowed to have intercourse, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Despite his unique heritage, and his early isolation, Trevor\u2019s mother provided him with an unconventional upbringing, one that obviously shaped him into the man and the success he would become as an adult. So, while this book is a memoir centered around Trevor\u2019s childhood memories, and is an enlightening peek into the culture of South Africa, what I took away from this book was how much his mother loved him, how her parenting influenced him, made him strong, taught him respect, and protected him from serious missteps. I think, in his way, this book is not only a collection of Trevor\u2019s vivid childhood memories and experiences, it\u2019s an ode to his mother. These stories are often hysterically funny, but of course there are few difficult passages, too. But, overall, I enjoyed this book all the way from start to finish. Trevor\u2019s voice is fresh and real, and his stories seem to come from his heart, showing a deep affection for his mom, detailing his adventures, both good and bad, with wry wit and humor that captured my heart and imagination. Trevor Noah is a wonderful comedic talent, but he\u2019s proven he can write with equal success. I hope he continues to drop by the book world from time to time and of course wish him much luck with his hosting duties on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019.4.5 stars", "\nI want this book right now right here\n", "An amazing story of a young man and his mother who went around the block a few times and beat the odds. Despite a few inaccuracies in his tale, it remains a well-told story that kept me reading and reading until the very end. Trevor Noah has that intelligent kindness like an astral light around him. He has that look of wisdom and experience in his eyes which allow people to like and want to listen to him. He is a gentle soul. I guess he can thank his mom for that. She was on his case, saving his soul since the day he was born. Trevor Noah starts out his book with his usual irony. He establishes a high-speed tone that promises a suspense thriller on the spot. He was thrown out of a car and it was not a Hollywood movie at all ! From there he introduces his mother and grandmother which sets the tone of this book.My whole family is religious, but where my mother was Team Jesus all the way, my grandmother balanced her Christian faith with the traditional Xhosa beliefs she\u2019d grown up with, communicating with the spirits of our ancestors. For a long time I didn\u2019t understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you\u2019re Native American and you pray to the wolves, you\u2019re a savage. If you\u2019re African and you pray to your ancestors, you\u2019re a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that\u2019s just common sense....My mom didn\u2019t want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-Man. A guy beating a thousand people to death with the jawbone of a donkey? That\u2019s pretty badass.He shares his personal story with so much wit and candor. Some incidences were so funny I just sat back and laughed and laughed. But then there were the moments of pain and sadness, so intense, that I felt like standing in his aura and hearing his thoughts before he expressed them. Tragic, yet destined to turn out to be miracles in the end. He shares many aspects of South African history and culture as background to his story, which enhances the experience for the reader. His sense of humor is always ready to jump in at the most unexpected moments. It was really a great read!As background to Trevor Noah's story, I want to provide a few tidbits of information.\"Apartheid\" was an American concept that was applied to the South African landscape. Not many people realize that. When the Americans thought it a good idea to provide reservations for the indigenous people, the South African government thought is was a brilliant idea as well and follow it up with their own interpretation. When Americans thought there should not be social interaction between races in public premises, the South Africans followed suit.Black-only bus stops serviced Black-only buses. Black-only ambulances stopped at Black-only hospitals. Black-only education was provided at Black-only schools and universities. Beaches, bridges, swimming pools, washrooms, cinemas, benches, parks and even burial grounds were all segregated. Interracial marriages were strictly forbidden.Black people had their own magazines, newspapers, authors, journalists, movies, artists, musicians, music concerts, businesses and communities. Many wealthy Black people lived in the separated areas (there were even a wealthy black suburb called Beverly Hills in SOWETO) and made a good living. Black lawyers, doctors, teachers, and religious leaders served their own community. For instance, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe both studied at the University of Fort Hare and finished their further studies at other universities, such as the universities of the Witwatersrand(WITS) and South Africa(UNISA). Their training were subsidized by the Apartheid government. They enjoyed free education as a result, while the White community had to pay for everything. Trevor Noah himself could have gone to university on the same principles with even more bursaries available to him than there were for white people. It is still the case.Biggest issue: Black people were denied the vote.His 'Hitler' story also lacked insight into the Afrikaner history (and neither did he knew about the HOLOCAUST and the Jewish experience). Trevor and his young adult friends were simply ignorant young men doing their own thing. Of course he did not have to know it, since it was never part of his own life. He described the Afrikaners's \"love\" for Hitler, but did not know how it worked. The Afrikaners lost their families in the Anglo-Boer war in which Britain followed a scorched-earth policy, leaving the Afrikaner farmers bankrupt and their families destroyed, dead in the concentration camps. The impoverished farmers abandoned their farms, which were immediately grabbed by the British government and handed over to British soldiers as payment for their services against the Afrikaners during the war. When the world declared war against Hitler, a small group of embittered Afrikaners organized themselves into a rebellion to assist Hitler against Britain. They simply hated the English. They would join any country declaring war against England. However, the vast majority of Afrikaners joined Britain in combat against Hitler. My father was one of them. We are from German descend. The South African soldiers, the majority being from the Afrikaner community who joined Great Britain were all descendants of the French, Dutch and German. They were joining the English forces who were shipped from the British colonies at the time. I just wanted to clear that up. Trevor and his mom were not part of the elite. They lived in the moderate, poor areas where workers and entrepreneurs felt at home. I was so happy that he mentioned the cultural cuisine. The 'smileys' he mentioned, sheep's head, are still highly popular. There are even sheep head clubs in the country.His revolt for sheep's eyes, which is also something to fight and die for by the dedicated eaters, had me almost falling off my bed with laughter. I cannot stand it either, although my husband and his farmer friends would make sure they can all enjoy it by buying themselves enough sheep heads for their club meetings and ensure nobody misses out on the eyes! Yes, be strong, dear friends. We could all have been like that, so don't laugh! ;-)   \"Walkie-talkies\", which he did not mention, are the heads and feet of chickens, which are also popular delicacies in the Asian communities. Trevor Noah's mom, however, knew it was the only dish that would get him to stay home for dinner instead of going out and enjoy his beloved Macdonalds.And then there is the 'Marogo' which he enjoyed, which I grew up with. It is a healthy weed, cooked like green beans with potato and unions, and normally enjoyed as a side dish, heaped onto 'mieliepap' (maize porridge). You're simply not South African if you have not eaten Marog and pap! It taste like spinach with a creamy effect.He took me back to my own childhood days, in a different time and place of course, but the nostalgia of that time came rushing over me while reading this book. We had so many happy moments, despite circumstances, and like Trevor, we as children never knew about Apartheid. Adults did not talk about it. It was quite a revelation when we finally grasped the meaning. We were the generation who brought it to en end. His story is so inspirational. A feel-good experience. I can only congratulate him and wish him all the best in the world He deserves it. And, most importantly, he will make it.You gooooo Trevor!!!! Thank you for the wonderful memories you shared. You made this world a much better place to be in, just by being you and sharing your heartfelt, often funny story.", "I\u2019m joining the club of other Rioters who have read and loved this one. Something you should know about me: memoirs are NOT my jam. I can count on one hand the memoirs I\u2019ve read and enjoyed, so I was honestly shocked by how much I loved reading Born a Crime. Noah can tell a story like nobody\u2019s business, and very often his tales weave tragedy and comedy together in the best way imaginable. I also have to admire Noah\u2019s bare-bones honesty; he really doesn\u2019t front at all. If you\u2019re the type of person who wants a book that can make you laugh and cry in public, this is the one you\u2019ve been looking for.\u2014 Tasha Brandstatterfrom The Best Books We Read In February 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/28/riot-r... ____________________Never have I experienced such alternatively intense emotions as I have listening to this book, where Noah recounts stories of his childhood in truly terrible conditions with humor and matter-of-factness. I had moments where I felt crushed by the realities of Apartheid, wondering how humans can be so cruel, followed by long stretches of laughter where I must have looked batty while driving, such was my delight in a chapter about sneaky pooping (and the aftermath). I\u2019m talking crying laughing, gasping for air, and then eased back into some more sobering tales of close calls, losing friends, running from those who threatened him or his family. It\u2019s only January, but this book is absolutely in my personal top 5 for the year. If nothing else, Born a Crime speaks in universals about human experiences, even simple things like learning to speak someone else\u2019s native language and reaping the social benefits. It\u2019s just set in a world that\u2019s very far from my own.\u2013Kristina Pinofrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r... ____________________He might be the baby-faced host of The Daily Show, but he was also raised a mixed-race child during Apartheid. Listening to him narrate the story of his childhood and all of the dangers that came with his very existence showed me that he\u2019s a lot more than Jon Stewart\u2019s slightly-less-beloved replacement. I may be frustrated recently with his call for other people of color to be moderate in their reactions to the incoming administration, but getting a bit of insight into the pain and tragedy he suffered at the hands of similarly-minded people was informative for me and has changed the way I view him.\u2014 Elizabeth Allenfrom The Best Books We Read In December 2016: http://bookriot.com/2017/01/03/riot-r...", "Born a Crime Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah is such an interesting look into the life of a talented young man. I am a big fan of Trevor and watched his special on Netflix where he speaks of his life growing up but this goes into so much detail, it is stunning all that this guy goes through and is not a bitter man. He describes the horrible laws and society he is born into and the way he is looked at in his society. How he tries to see himself. His life in poverty, with a very religious mother, an abusive step father, his struggles to find himself and diligent acts, his family, the horrible times in his life and the good times in his life. Through it all, he keeps his humor and love alive and shares it with us in this wonderful book. There is so much in here and he tells it so well. He has a good heart and it comes out in this book. He is not jaded by his past but seems to be inspired to be better because of it. Great job Trevor, we love you! Thanks NetGalley for allowing me to read this wonderful, touching book!", "Born a Crime\n\nFunny guy- The very charming Trevor Noah*********************************************\n\"People love to say, \u201cGive a man a fish, and he\u2019ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he\u2019ll eat for a lifetime.\u201d What they don\u2019t say is, \u201cAnd it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.\u201d That\u2019s the part of the analogy that\u2019s missing.\"\nTrevor Noah*********************************************By the time Trevor Noah was born in 1984, Apartheid, the system that institutionalized segregation and racial discrimination in his native South Africa, was already in its last throes. But young Trevor still got to experience plenty of the negative effects of that horrific system.The relationship between his black African mother and his white Swiss father, was legally prohibited by the 1927 \"Immorality Act\", a crime that could carry up to 5 years in prison. These laws were not a mere abstraction, they were actively enforced by the authorities.Noah did a good job at giving us a condensed version of the history of Apartheid. He explains how it was used to create fissures among the black population, and give us an insider's perspective of the real life consequences it had in the lives of millions of people.My sense is that this book was written with a Western audience in mind, so he takes the time to compare Apartheid to similar repressive movements in other parts of the world, such as the removal of Native Americans, European Colonialism and Slavery and the Jim Crow era in America.On this topic he remarks:\n\"In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.\"\n\n\nBaby Trevor growing up in South AfricaThe issue of race is a complicated one and Noah acknowledges how being biracial was a source of distress and confusion, while at the same time protected him and enhanced his social status.Personally I can relate to this. Colorism was something I encountered in the society where I grew up. Having a lighter skin didn't guarantee success, but it certainly helped remove a potential obstacle and it opened doors that otherwise could have remained closed.And yet, young Trevor frequently felt like an outsider, tolerated but not fully accepted. This started to change once he moved from her family home and started looking for ways to make a living.From his mother, he inherited an entrepreneurial spirit and started making some money by utilizing his many skills; he was multi-lingual, good with technology and had a knack for mixing music that his peers loved.If necessity is the mother of invention, Trevor and his fellow hustlers were the embodiment of that maxim. Eventually things turned bad when he became involved in petty crimes and got in trouble with the law.I think the most important chapter of this book is the one where Noah describes the social dynamics of the \"hood\" and how difficult it is for a kid without a support system to break the cycle of poverty and violence.\n\"We tell people to follow their dreams\" he says,\"but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.\"\nTrevor's mother is the one constant and positive presence in his life, a deeply religious, strong woman who taught him to \"challenge authority and question the system\". By the end of the memoir he realizes that she more than anyone, is the person he can count on. She is his saving grace. There are plenty of funny moments and hilarious anecdotes on Born a Crime, so it would be tempting to categorize this as just a rag-to-riches, pull up by your bootstraps kind of story. In reality though, Noah has written a profound account about his humble beginnings, the pervasive presence of violence in his home and his country at large, and his own racial identity crisis, the result of having been born in a place where the frequent reaction to a person of mixed race was astonishment, contempt or both.The fact that Noah was able to overcome such a difficult upbringing it almost miraculous and reason enough to read his story. But I think his views on poverty, racism, domestic violence are also worth listening to, mainly because he has the emotional scars to prove his credentials as a reliable witness.This is a very moving memoir that will make you laugh and cry, but I trust that it will also leave you with a good dose of optimism.", "Overall, Born a Crime is a fascinating story, but the loose editing and too casual a writing style meant it lacked narrative cohesion for me, so it's a solid 3 star review. Trevor Noah's childhood memoir definitely showcases his fresh, witty perspective and provide a lot of history and context of life under apartheid and life just after the end of apartheid, from a macro level of the forces and powers at work and warring against each other, to the micro level of Trevor and his family's experiences in that time. I've visited South Africa before and felt I knew a decent amount about the country's culture and history, but Noah really brought to light intricacies of daily life and nuances about how different groups interacted and experienced each other under and after apartheid. Noah's family is mostly seen in brief anecdotes and sketches, but his mother is a central figure and the most compelling character we encounter. Her faith, her hustle, her perseverance, and her sense of humor are palpable in Noah's writing, and we are shown the complex but very loving relationship between Trevor and his mother expand and grow over the years. Because the anecdotes and stories are presented in a non linear fashion, it can be difficult to get a fix on sense of time and when things are happening for Trevor and his mother and brothers. It also chops up the narrative flow, which meant that I was less interested in Trevor's own story since it kept hopping around in the timeline, and more interested in his family story and the larger context about how his race/color was being constantly perceived and redefined by different groups, and also by himself. As a multiracial American, I could relate to many aspects of Trevor's own shifting identity for himself and his peers, but many other aspects were completely foreign and indeed eye opening for me.The casual way Trevor narrates is both a highlight and a fault: it definitely jumps off the page is being securely in his voice, so it has a true feeling of authenticity. But it also has an effect of little editing and a lack of polish, so where other memoirists link events within a larger narrative framework and immerse you in the story AND the writing, here it's more disjointed, less cohesive, so you appreciate some of the parts more than the sum of their parts. And not all of the individual anecdotes feel fully worthy of inclusion. And the ending feels less like a natural ending and more like Noah ran out of steam (though the final story of the attempted murder of his mother is powerful and scary and was probably hard to write).Ultimately if you're a fan of Trevor Noah, or are interested in a unique perspective that unites childhood under and after apartheid with larger historical and social context of South Africa, Born a Crime is a solid choice. It's an easy read, but it took me longer than usual to finish since I was not really engaged with the non linear narrative and the style and format of the writing itself, though the subject matter was interesting.", "Once again, I decided to read something from the non-fiction/biography genres. Partly because I adore Trevor Noah as a person. Partly because I love Trevor Noah's voice & appreciate when authors tell their own stories, both fictional and non-fictional. & Partly because I want to try and get more comfortable with reads like this that are outside of my normal realm. In this Trevor tells many stories from his childhood in South Africa. He is funny, well-spoken, and insightful as he discusses how being the product of a white Swiss father and a black South African mother both worked for and against him, depending on the situation. This was an excellent book, though I wish he hadn't jumped around on his timeline as much as he did. It wasn't really a big deal but I sort of had trouble keeping up with the chronological order of the events he was describing. I would very much recommend this for everyone, even if you don't particularly like Trevor Noah! My friend Michael talks about how much he enjoyed the book in his review, despite not being the author's biggest fan.", "\n\nInstagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI consider myself an unofficial expert on celebrity memoirs. I haven't read all of them (although I would like to - even the stupid ones, because I am incredibly nosy and devour celebrity gossip the way other people devour Dorritos or fake news), but I've read a fair amount, and they usually follow a typical narrative arc. In BORN A CRIME, Trevor Noah takes that arc, flattens it out, and beats you over the head with it.I love Trevor Noah. I love what he brings to The Daily Show. I think he's incredibly funny, intellectual, erudite, and charming. I also think he's cute, but that's neither here nor there. I actually first learned about him through his (in)famous video with \"she who shall not be named\" (no, not Voldemort's sister - but close). I was really impressed by how he went about the interview. That could have been really ugly - but it wasn't; it was a somewhat civil discourse between two opposing views, about why the political beliefs of a certain demographic can be incredibly problematic.When I found out that this Trevor Noah person, this cool political cucumber, had a memoir out, I immediately put myself on hold for it at the library. Unfortunately, so did about a billion other people. It took two freaking months for me to finally get my hands on BORN A CRIME. Normally, when I wait that long, I start to lose interest and by the time I get the book I sometimes forget why I even bothered to put it on hold in the first place. Not so, here.Trevor Noah's memoir is not like other memoirs because he doesn't talk about his \"famous\" life at all. BORN A CRIME is about Trevor Noah's childhood growing up in South Africa while it was still under apartheid. He talks about slavery, segregation, racism, poverty, domestic violence and abuse, and all manner of other troubling topics, but he does it in a way that, while not exactly unpleasant, never becomes so graphic or unpleasant that I had to put the book down and take a deep breath. At times, he even manages to make the terrible situation he's describing funny, which is truly a testament to his amazing sense of humor.There's a lot more I can say, but most of it would just be recaps from the memoir and more praise about Trevor himself. I really, really loved this book. It kind of reminds me of another memoir I read about a biracial man, THE COLOR OF WATER by James McBride, but I feel like BORN A CRIME is going to be a lot more accessible because a) he's a pop-cultural icon, b) Noah's book is broader in scope in terms of topics discussed, and c) he's a millennial so his language will resonate with a lot of people, especially the young bloggers, who are reading and reviewing this book.Read this book. It was totally worth waiting for two months for.5 stars", "I was lucky to see Trevor Noah speak about this book recently, and the way he talked about his story, and his life growing up in South Africa made me all the more eager to read it! The book is a cohesive collection of stories from his childhood and early adulthood, and though I am not typically a reader of much non-fiction, I found this book truly compelling and hard to put down!Noah has a way of really drawing you in, and making you feel as though you are there with him, experiencing his memories and seeing South Africa during and after apartheid as he did. He doesn't glorify himself and doesn't shy from describing certain flaws in himself, his family and the world he grew up in, which makes it seem very real and believable, and makes me wish I knew even more.I have never visited South Africa, but I felt like a true armchair traveler reading \"Born a Crime\", and learning about the way of life of \"ordinary\" people, instead of monumental historical figures like Nelson Mandela. I liked how Noah gave character to individual neighborhood I had never heard of, but can now visualize with a sense of greater understanding. His descriptions of the people in this book make them come to life, especially his mother, who raised Noah under difficult circumstances and to whom the book is dedicated. She is such a central character, if you will, of this book, and Noah doesn't sugarcoat her actions or mentality, which sometimes made it difficult for me to fully understand the devotion he felt toward her, when she so often put him down, beat him, and forced him to accept that her second husband and father of Noah's two younger brothers was a violent, deeply unpleasant man, whom she did not leave until it was almost too late. This was difficult to read, at times, but definitely served to paint a truly vivid image of her and of their, sometimes fraught, but ultimately loving relationship.The explanation of segregation and divides between race were another element that fascinated me about this story, especially in light of the racial tensions that have arisen in society and culture recently, made more visible through social media and the fast pace of news (though they have obviously been there a long time). I knew, of course, of the way apartheid worked, and the extreme division and misery it created, but I did not know of the many different classifications that existed within African communities themselves, that \"colored\" people, as Noah describes those of mixed race, were not included in black communities or white communities, and that he, being the son of a white man and a black woman, never felt he fit in properly. It is interesting to read about this, and though the book is set in Africa, I think it is, in a way, quite timely, and well worth reading, if only to see that change for the better can happen. Segregation and racism exist everywhere, and therefore people must collectively work against it to create societies that value tolerance and diversity.This was a well-written, thought-provoking book and I would recommend it to fans Trevor Noah, or even those who have never heard of him, but what to be entertained, and learn something in the bargain.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com", "4.5 stars Trevor Noah, a comedian and the current host of 'The Daily Show' is a very funny guy.....and I expected this memoir to be full of witty jokes. It's not. The book is about Trevor growing up in South Africa when apartheid was coming to an end. Apartheid and it's aftermath left the impoverished black population of South Africa with hard lives and few opportunities. Nevertheless, Trevor infuses his story with hope and humor.Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah (Trevor's mother)Adult Trevor Noah with his father Robert NoahTrevor was born in 1984, to a white Swiss father and a black mother from the Xhosa tribe. At that time, apartheid was still in effect and mixing of the races was forbidden by law. Thus, light-skinned Trevor was evidence of a crime. The child - who lived with his mother in a black neighborhood - had to stay hidden inside during his early childhood....lest he be grabbed by the authorities and taken to an orphanage. Trevor Noah with his mother Little Trevor NoahYoung Trevor rarely went outside because mixed race children could be taken away School age Trevor NoahNomalizo Frances Noah (Trevor's grandmother) in front of her house, where Trevor lived as a kid Trevor's grandmother inside her homeTrevor's grandmother is proud of her familyTrevor's grandmother was reluctant to discipline him because she might damage his light skin The dismantling of apartheid in the early 1990's eased the situation for blacks and people of mixed race (classified as 'colored'), and Trevor and his mother - named Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - embarked on a rather tumultuous life. Patricia acquired secretarial skills and got an office job, which meant the Noahs were a little bit better off than many black South African families. Patricia even had a junky old car which - being a devout Christian - she used to 'schlep' Trevor to three or four different churches every Sunday. South African churchWhen Patricia wasn't working or at church she loaded Trevor into the car and took him to places that cost no money, like parks, picnics, and sightseeing past white people's mansions. Trevor's mom had the attitude \"I'm going to give you everything I never had.\" Patricia made it her mission to provide food for Trevor's body and books for his mind - and to afford this, spent almost no money on anything else. Trevor's mom bought him booksAs Trevor describes it: their car was a tin can on wheels; they lived in the middle of nowhere; they had shabby furniture; they changed the channels on their tiny black and white TV with pliers; and they wore clothes from thrift stores. During good times Trevor's family ate chicken, but when times were tough they ate food meant for dogs like 'sawdust' (meat scraps) and 'soup bones.' During one terrible month - when the mechanic business of Trevor's stepfather was failing - the family had to live on marogo (wild spinach) cooked with mopane worms (caterpillars). Trevor describes this as the worst time of his life.MarogoMopane wormsTrevor was a self-described 'naughty child' whose high energy level and mischievous pranks got him into lots of trouble. Trevor also loved fire and once burned down the house of a white family. To escape spankings from his mother, Trevor would streak out of the house and through the neighborhood - with Patricia close behind. As a result Trevor became a very fast runner, a talent that would be useful later on - when he had to run away from cops and tough guys. Though Patricia didn't spare the spankings, she punished Trevor 'out of love' - and he reciprocated the affection. Trevor was an enterprising youth and found inventive ways to make money. By the time he was in high school Trevor was selling pirated CDs he made at home - an enterprise that led to deejaying parties in black townships. Trevor also partnered up with a couple of friends to run a kind of 'loan and barter' business, which netted plenty of extra cash for McDonald's, beer, and electronic equipment. Trevor Noah looking coolOn the downside, Trevor never fit in anywhere. Being a light-skinned black, Trevor wasn't accepted by blacks, whites, Indians, Asians, or colored people (most of whom have a complicated ancestry beginning with Dutch settlers and black women). To compensate Trevor made it his business to learn many of the languages spoken in South Africa, including English, Afrikaans, Sotho, Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, and more. This made Trevor a sort of 'chameleon' who could get by with everyone.Trevor also had bad luck with girls, partly because he had terrible acne. Trevor describes several attempts to get a girlfriend, and these tales are amusing....and a little heartbreaking. In high school, for example, Trevor's friend set him up with a beautiful girl named Babiki for the matric dance (prom). Trevor and his friend hung out with Babiki and her sisters for a couple of months before the dance, getting acquainted. Then, on the night of the matric dance, Babiki refused to get out of the car and go inside. Trevor realized - for the very first time - that Babiki couldn't speak English and he couldn't speak Pedi (her language). Ha ha ha.Trevor Noah attended school at HC Jack in Highlands North, JohannesburgGirls dressed up for the matric danceThe worst thing that happened in Trevor's life was his mother's marriage to Abel, a car mechanic with a murderous temper and a strong 'master of the house' attitude. Patricia sold her house, quit her job, and impoverished the family to help Abel with his mechanic business....to no avail. Abel was a terrible businessman who drank up the profits and came home intoxicated and abusive. In fits of anger Abel would hit Patricia and slap Trevor around. By the time Trevor finished high school he had to move out. Patricia ultimately left Abel, who eventually became so distraught that he shot her in the head. In addition to his personal story Trevor talks about the evils of apartheid.....how the system purposely fomented discord among black tribes (especially Zulu and Xhosa), impoverished the non-white population, denied non-whites a decent education, left them untrained for jobs, made them feel inferior, took their homes and land, forced them into barren homelands, etc. etc. etc. Trevor touches on how this affected himself, his extended family, and his friends.....and the story is sad, bleak and dismaying. Zulu tribe celebrationXhosa tribe celebration (Trevor's mother belonged to the Xhosa tribe)Trevor's mother survived being shot in the head.....and the book ends there. Trevor doesn't talk about becoming a comedian, his show business career, or becoming host of The Daily Show. The program's original host, Jon Stewart, was terrific and I was sad when he left. Still, Trevor is doing a good job (in my opinion). He's personable, smart and funny.....and his impressions and accents are spot on. Trevor makes me laugh every time I watch the show. If Trevor writes a sequel to this book, I'll read it for sure. :)Trevor Noah sharing his book with a friendTrevor Noah is a funny guyI'd highly recommend the book to fans of celebrity memoirs and to readers interested in apartheid and South Africa.Thanks to Netgalley, the author, and the publisher for a copy of the book.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com", "The only thing I knew about Trevor Noah prior to this audiobook was his status as host of The Daily Show, a show that I don't watch. Also, celebrity autobiographies: not really my thing (barring the odd  exception). But that title demands curiosity: how can someone be born a crime? So, I picked up the book in a bookstore, read the dust jacket, and thought Hey, this seems like it might be good. I then put the book down and promptly forgot about the whole thing. Of course, then I began to see it popping up on best-of-the-year lists and the reviews started to pour in from you intrepid Goodreadians. Soon after, my monthly audible credit arrived just in time for another road trip to outport Newfoundland. I gave the audio a 30 second sample and, impressed by Noah's decision to narrate his own tale, decided to take a small gamble on the audiobook.It's lovely when a gamble pays off, isn't it?Look, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time waxing lyrical about this book, I'm just going to give it to you straight: listen to this one. This book is great in a way that makes me question how other celebrities manage to fill their books. Noah's lived in a way and world that few of us can imagine, and he's cobbled together a series of stories about his time in South Africa that all oddly fit together into a great overarching tale. There are stories of hardship, musings on apartheid and race relations, profound moments of self-discovery, and tense, heart-pounding scenes.Oh yeah, it's also relentless funny. I mean, Trevor Noah's a comedian after all! Here Noah uses humour to great effect to contrast with the hopeless and absurd in equal measure. Bolstered by his narration, the tale glides from one story to the next, Noah doing splendid voices for his family members and friends when appropriate. The whole thing feels like sitting down with a buddy over a few beer: the stories walk zig-zagging trails toward hilarious punchlines that also betray subtle bits of personal philosophy.Touching, funny, and endlessly compelling, you've just got to give this one a go. Preferably in audiobook format as Noah's narration adds an essential layer to the proceedings.", "I really liked this book about Trevor Noah's childhood in South Africa. I listened to this on audio, narrated by the comedian himself, and I appreciated his frank storytelling. I enjoyed his memories of his mother and grandmother, and the details of the various scrapes he got into as a kid. It was especially enlightening hearing what his mother went through just to be able to see his father, who was Swiss. Because interracial relationships were forbidden under apartheid, they had to be clever to get around the rules and avoid suspicion. I would highly recommend Born a Crime to anyone interested in reading about what it was like to live under apartheid. However, if you want to hear about how Trevor made his way to America and eventually became the new host of The Daily Show, you'll have to wait until he writes another book. This one focuses on his family and growing up in South Africa. As a reader, I appreciated the emphasis on his childhood. The celebrity part of his life can be written later.**Warning: Strong Opinions Ahead.**In a strange way, this book was actually a comfort to me during a difficult time. I read Born a Crime shortly after the U.S. presidential election, in which a man with no government experience and who frequently made sexist, racist and dictatorial statements was declared the winner over an extremely qualified woman, despite the fact that the man lost the popular vote by 2.8 million, and the knowledge that Russia interfered with our so-called democratic election.To say I was angry and depressed after that election is an understatement. But fortunately I had Trevor Noah's book downloaded, and heard about the horrible conditions of apartheid. (Everything is relative, folks. At least we aren't headed back to the days of separate bathrooms and drinking fountains.) His elders would caution Trevor against being angry all the time, saying that it wasn't productive. Trevor's book also reminded me that positive change still happens, even when things seem darkest. Apartheid eventually ended, and the Donald won't be president forever. Must. Stay. Positive.Favorite Quotes\"The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what it was. You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all.\"\"Where most children are proof of their parents' love, I was the proof of their criminality.\"\"I grew up in a world run by women.\"\"Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says 'We're the same.' A language barrier says, 'We're different.' The architects of apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well ... The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it's easily tricked. If you're racist and you meet someone who doesn't look like you, the fact that he can't speak like you reinforces your racist preconceptions. He's different, less intelligent ... However, if the person who doesn't look like you speaks like you, your brain short-circuits because your racism program has none of those instructions in the code.\"\"I learned to use language like my mother did. I would simulcast -- give you the program in your own tongue. I'd get suspicious looks from people just walking down the street. 'Where are you from?' they'd ask. I'd reply in whatever language they'd addressed me in, using the same accent that they used. There would be a brief moment of confusion and then the suspicious look would disappear. 'Oh, okay. I thought you were a stranger. We're good then.'\"", "ETA: The more I think about this book after having finished it, the more annoyed I become. I have changed my rating to one star. I did not like this book. What tipped the balance for me is the \"Go Hitler\" chant. The author's explanation was not adequate and I found the whole episode inappropriately drawn. ******************I was perpetually annoyed while reading this book. Perhaps this is my own fault. I misunderstood what its central focus was to be. It is less a book about growing up in South Africa than about adolescence, a dysfunctional family and physical abuse. In addition, I did not like the writing style. The first section of the book does offer a bit on South African history but only in sweeping terms. Apartheid practices are viewed through personal events. We see how race and religion came to shape the author\u2019s life. The book does not follow a strictly chronological order, and I found this at times confusing. The central portion of the book deals with the author\u2019s adolescence. Here the writing mirrors adolescent emotions. It is filled with swear words and smart aleck expressions. We hear of his problems with acne, dating and not fitting in. Drinking, hip-hop dancing, a disastrous prom night, bootlegging of CDs and DJ parties may interest others, but not me!I came to understand the author and the strong bond he felt for his mother, but his mother\u2019s behavior is not covered with adequate depth. While her strong religiosity is emphasized, these beliefs do not always fit well with her other life choices. This left me puzzled. The final events of the book take a very dramatic turn. Ending on this note a reader may feel drawn to express sympathy and compassion. Does the exciting conclusion and the horror and sympathy all readers come to feel influence one\u2019s rating of the book? My rating is based solely on my evaluation of the book and does not reflect the compassion I came to feel for the family. The humor did not make me laugh, and I found the author\u2019s philosophical generalizations sophomoric. There is an all too long section on defecation. I found this disgusting. It should have been removed or at least shortened! The conjoining philosophical commentary is ridiculous. It is stated that when we defecate we are all on equal terms. Wow, I am terribly impressed with such remarkable wisdom. I am being sarcastic! The author reads his own audiobook. The reading is clear and easy to follow. I think by listening to his words one better understand his emotions and what he wishes to convey. I thought the book would have much more about life in South Africa and less about physical abuse in a dysfunctional family. The dramatic ending may appeal to some. The central portion will most certainly appeal more to young than to mature readers.", "Trevor Noah is a South African comedian who currently hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Born a Crime is about growing up in South Africa: living under apartheid when his existence was evidence of a crime, life after apartheid, the deep bond between a mother and son, the unique challenges of growing up mixed race, and living with an abusive stepfather. It's filled with humor and biting social commentary, but the main words that describe this book are insightful and heartfelt. I was already a casual fan, but this book can be read by anyone since his career is barely mentioned.\nPeople are willing to accept you if they see you as an outsider trying to assimilate into their world. But when they see you as a fellow tribe member attempting to disavow the tribe, that is something they will never forgive.\nBorn a Crime is a collection of stories from Trevor's life with a generally linear timeline. There was a tiny bit of jumpiness-- occasionally there would be something mentioned that would be elaborated on in another story. Overall, I really liked the format because there was no filler. Each chapter worked on its own and had a clear lesson, so I viewed them each individually. Trevor was always getting into trouble growing up and some of the chapters are about his antics. While these stories are hilarious on their own, he also places these anecdotes within a wider social context. I've read a few books by South African authors this year and I wish I would've read this one first! Of all I've read and seen on the topic, this is the one that made the history 'click' the most. Each chapter is preceded by either historical or personal context. He also puts everything in perspective for outsiders: \"In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.\" It's a good reminder of the similarities between cultures and institutions, even though the specifics may vary.\nLove is a creative act. When you love someone you create a new world for them. My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things I learned, I came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her.\nTrevor was born to a black mother and a white father during a time when sexual relations between the two were strictly forbidden by law. He couldn't even walk beside his parents in public. It was interesting to read how he interpreted these events as a child. He describes the complicated rules enacted to keep an illogical system functioning and trying to find his place in a world with such defined boundaries. His close relationship with his mother was one of my favorite parts of the book. He describes his mother as a rebel and I loved reading about how she subverted the system! She raised Trevor to know that there was no limit to what he could accomplish: \u201cEven if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I\u2019ve done enough.\u201d He reveals the wisdom she imparted that made him the man he is today. Like his mom, he has a remarkable ability to adapt. I could also see where he gets his sense of humor! Even in one of the most tragic moments of the story, she's able to joke around. Though his father isn\u2019t in the book as much, the chapter about him and the gift of being chosen is one of the parts that hit me the hardest.\nWe live in a world where we don\u2019t see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don\u2019t live with them. If we could see one another\u2019s pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it to us to commit the crimes in the first place.\nBorn a Crime is an insightful memoir that strikes the perfect balance of historical and personal. I learned a lot and it gave me a better context for what I already knew. It made me laugh and cry. I know I love a book when I'm giving everyone around me daily updates! If you are interested in the subjects addressed in this book, you might be interested in the short article Inner City by Lauren Beukes. Her short story collection Slipping is coming out in November, which features some stories about South African culture. \nPeople love to say, \u201cGive a man a fish, and he\u2019ll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he\u2019ll eat for a lifetime.\u201d What they don\u2019t say is, \u201cAnd it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod.\u201d\n____________I received this book for free from NetGalley and Spiegel & Grau in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. The publication date is November 15, 2016.", "Within the first twenty pages of this book, I regretted just two days earlier writing the sentence \u201cTrevor Noah, while smart and funny, doesn't feel like a must-watch\u201d while lamenting how much I miss Jon Stewart.This is perhaps the most remarkable celebrity memoir I\u2019ve ever read. I am a hyperbolic person by nature, but I\u2019m really hard pressed to remember one that\u2019s made this big an impression on me. Not just because of the content--which is at times heartbreaking and mindblowing--but also because of the humor and warmth with which Trevor Noah\u2019s managed to convey some very difficult life experiences.Born in South Africa in the mid '80s, Trevor Noah\u2019s very existence as a biracial child was illegal. Even though apartheid fell while he was still a child, he faced unique challenges due to his ill-defined racial identity. He stood out as light-skinned in the poverty stricken black neighborhoods, but that didn\u2019t mean that he was spared the poverty or the prejudice faced by anyone who wasn\u2019t white.Noah introduces each of his stories with a little bit of background information on the political climate and culture of South Africa. Then he describes different phases of his life through that lens, looking at how his childhood friendships, early attempts at romance, and a sometimes turbulent family life: His mother remained single by choice until Noah was around 10, then she married a man with a violent temper and he lost touch with his birth father. It\u2019s not all bleak, though. Some of the stories are just about the hi-jinks that a teenaged Noah got into with his friends. It should not surprise you to know that he was a bit of a troublemaker and a hustler in his youth. But even when he\u2019s describing some unimaginable difficulties, Noah managed to make me laugh SO MUCH. His solution to his fear of using an outhouse shared by several other families in his grandmother\u2019s neighborhood? Ridiculous. The time that he didn\u2019t realize that his date to the school dance didn\u2019t speak the same language as him? Hilarious. His response to his mother throwing him out of a moving vehicle because she was afraid that the driver of the minibus was going to kill them? Shouldn\u2019t be funny, but it was.But, the story that killed me was the one where he realized just how problematic his friend Hitler\u2019s name is. This is the kind of book that knocked my worldview around a little bit. I always knew that, yes, life under apartheid was hard, but Noah showed me just how hard, in a very visceral and personal way. He also showed how the shadow of apartheid lingered long after Nelson Mandela walked free, something that\u2019s easy to forget. But what he really does so well here is demonstrate the power of human resilience. He gives so much credit to his mother, which seems to phenomenally deserved. But as amazing a portrait as he paints of her, I\u2019m left with a newfound respect for Trevor\u2019s own ability to overcome and succeed against the odds. And to do so with a straight head and an amazingly funny sense of humor? Blows my mind. I gotta start watching The Daily Show every night again.

But the way of storytelling about the heroine\u2019s trauma wasn\u2019t strong enough, it didn\u2019t make me feel sorry for her. I found her emotional turmoil a little superficial and unreliable.And of course I didn\u2019t like our hero so much. I found him a little indecisive, passive, boring. At the end as soon as he thought he was rejected by heroine, he just gave up and he never showed how he felt about her. He never wanted to meet her at first because he had issues about changing things in his life( which is ridiculous excuse) then as soon as he discovered she had a great body, he asked for a date !!!The things I liked most are: hero and heroine\u2019s communication way with post its.And supporting characters Richie and Rachel( they deserve their own book)Maybe I read too many angsty books lately so I increased my pain level and this book was too soft, painless and a little boring for me.", "this story really grew on me, in the best way possible. i guess its true what they say, that opposites attract, because a couple of things that would normally be off-putting to me as a reader (tiffy being stereotypically \u2018quirky\u2019 and the odd writing/formatting of leons chapters) turned out to be very endearing and made me enjoy the story that much more. i love how this radiated british humour. its so understated, undervalued even, and i thought leon was hilarious. both characters are charming and i thought tiffy went through an amazing character development. for being a light and fluffy book, there are some quite serious topics discussed in this, mainly emotional abuse and manipulation; but i thought it was handled really well, in a way that was loyal and realist to the characters and story. overall, im very much impressed with this debut novel and i think its safe to say beth o\u2019leary is an author to keep an eye on!\u21a0 3.5 stars", "I couldn\u2019t be more surprised that I actually enjoyed this book. A romance?! Who am I?!Tiffy has just gone through a messy break up, she has very little money and desperately needs to find somewhere to live. Leon is paying costs for his brother and could do with some extra cash. They strike a deal, share a flat and even a bed, but they will never be there at the same time. Leon works night shifts so he will have the flat during the day while Tiffy works 9-5 and she\u2019ll have it at night. Tiffy and Leon communicate mainly through post it notes and shared leftovers. As you\u2019d expect they eventually meet and dot dot dot!!Honestly it was adorable. It was realistic. Tiffy and Leon are wonderful and vibrant characters and I cheered them on all the way. Despite the many problems and obstacles they overcame. 4 stars \u2b50\ufe0f ", "\nIt\u2019s weird how easily you can get to know someone from the traces they leave behind.\nThe best kinds of books are those that surprise you with their perfection. I was expecting this to be a cutesy light hearted read. It was and it wasn't. The characters were more complex than I had anticipated and so was the plot. Tiffy is desperate for a place to live and Leon is short on cash. They come to an odd arrangement. They will share not only a flat but the same bed. Leon has the flat for the day until he starts his shift at the hospital and Tiffy gets it at night. But the strangest part of the arrangement is that they never meet. What starts as leaving a note to remember to leave the toilet seat down turns into a correspondence between friends. Both have their own life problems to deal with and it was so beautiful to see how they supported and helped one another. A book with a written correspondence between the main characters are one of my favourite kinds. Be it email or letter or text, I just love seeing how two people can form a bond withought having seen each other. Leon's chapters were very different in style. The sentences were shorter and direct and I liked how they conveyed his way of thinking. The two POV's were distinct and I loved how you could clearly tell them apart. While this style of writing probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, I enjoyed the hell out of it. I am so glad I read this. It is being added to my favourites list and I will definitely give it a reread. I can't wait to see what else Beth O'leary has in store for us. TW: EMOTIONAL ABUSE; EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION; STALKING_______Pre-weekend buddy read with my gal Warda! \ud83d\udc97", "now available in both hardback and eBook format in the UK / IrelandYasssssss!!! Oh I have been waiting for a book like this one to come along FOR YEARS! The Flatshare is exactly what I want from a romantic comedy/dramedy type book... It's got hugely likeable protagonists in the form of Tiffy and Leon, a highly original setup for the meeting of these two characters, a cast of interesting supporting characters and side storylines but most of all... It feels fresh!!! Hallelujah for that. I have found myself getting so jaded when it comes to this genre of book but this one is a veritable diamond in the rough. 'The Flatshare' does not feel like so many of the countless romantic-comedy/dramedy books I've read throughout the years.The setup for this book is a bit bonkers but it really works. Tiffy and Leon are flatmates with a twist. They share a bed! But Leon is in the flat only during the day as he works night shifts. Whereas Tiffy is in the flat at nights and on the weekends. Their lives are so separate that they haven't even met... I mean we know where this is going right? BUT THE JOURNEY IS FABULOUS! Tiffy and Leon start leaving generic post it notes for each other around the flat (regarding things such as bin day, leftover food etc) but these notes gradually evolve into a deeper intimacy and the two find themselves wondering a lot more about the other person and if maybe there is a significant connection. The pacing is perfect btw, I thought the book might have the error of using the notes as the sole point of contact between the two leads for too long, but, the author got it spot on with how she kept building upon their burgeoning relationship. Tiffy is the traditional quirky type of leading lady that we so often get in these books BUT because of the great writing and the fact that she has a fabulous backstory and is a character laden with genuine feelings and emotions, her quirkiness feels authentic to who she is as a person. And who she is is also incredibly relatable. She's got a wonderfully human quality about her and is fabulously dynamic in that at times she's spunky but others is vulnerable and weak. Leon bless him is just lovely. He's so quiet but filled with lots of hidden emotions. The backstory regarding his mum and his brother and how that translates to his chosen career is quite touching to read about. So what I really wasn't expecting is that this story is far more emotional than I ever thought possible from a light read. This is because it deals with some heavy issues regarding destructive and controlling relationships; all of which I thought were handled in quite an appropriate fashion for such an accessible / easy read. And what happily contrasted with that emotional side of the book were a great number of humorous moments. I laughed out loud FREQUENTLY at the fabulous jokes and witty dialogue between the characters. FYI, for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing, there are some fabulous patriarchy bashing jokes in the book that are absolute gems! If you're a fan of romantic comedies and romantic dramadies then this book is definitely one you should pick up when it's published in April 2019. *An e-copy of this book was kindly provided to me by the publisher, Quercus, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*", "4 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Adorable, Left Me Feeling Content Stars for Beth O'Leary's The FlatshareThis book worked its way into my heart with its: ~ slow burn romance (and I'm usually not a slow burn fan!)~ adorable post-it notes (I LOVED reading the back & forth notes!)~ fierce, quirky & hilariously inappropriate friends (everyone needs a Tribe like this in their life!)~ subtle yet frank look at emotional/psychological abuse (totally unexpected but handled appropriately for this type of read)There is unexpected depth and so much heart in this sweet little book! I had one day to read it before having to return it to the library and was worried I wouldn't be able to do it. It says a lot about the book's pull that I managed to finish it in a couple hours, in 1 sitting.", "This is a charming and lovely piece of contemporary fiction from Beth O'Leary that takes an interesting premise of a one bedroom flat in London being shared by two occupants who never meet, each in residence, sleeping in the same bed, when the other is out or working. A more exploitative version of this is the overcrowded sharing of accommodation in the desperate working conditions experienced by trafficked, illegal and migrant workers. This is a more benign and comic take focusing on the dire financial straits many workers face in a city with sky high rents. Compassionate palliative care nurse, Leon Twomey, a man of few words has a girlfriend, Kay, and a younger brother, Richie, in prison after being framed for armed robbery. Leon needs money to pay Richie's lawyer to secure an appeal hearing, so Tiffany 'Tiffy' Moore moves in, and for months they never meet, their paths never cross, but a quirky and offbeat relationship develops between the pair of them through the form of post-it notes.Tiffy is still hankering after her ex-boyfriend, the wealthy and manipulative Justin who has evicted her from his flat after getting involved with another woman. She is an assistant editor for a niche independent DIY and crafts publisher, overworked and paid a pittance. Her star client author is Katherin, a woman who writes books on the art of crocheting, and who will do nothing without Tiffy in attendance. Tiffy is supported by her friends, counsellor Mo and hotshot barrister, Gerty, and fellow workmate, Rachel. It gradually begins to emerge that Tiffy's relationship with Justin was a much darker and murkier affair as Tiffy begins to experience disturbing feelings and flashbacks. Upset and slowly beginning to recognise that she was a victim of emotional abuse, she is startled to discover just how much Gerty and Mo hated Justin for what he was doing to her, but had kept silent, knowing Tiffy would never have listened to them. Leon is familiar with emotional abuse, having seen his mother experience it at the hands of the type of men she chose as he was growing up. Beth O'Leary writes a captivating novel that shines thanks to her stellar characterisation, you cannot help but fall for Tiffy and Leon, and the brilliant supporting cast of Richie, Gerty, Mo and Rachel. Then there are Leon's terminal patients at the hospice, for whom Leon will do anything, like embarking on finding the lost love of the crocheting Mr Robert Prior, and the young, feisty Holly, smart enough to intuit she is Leon's favourite patient, despite him never saying it. This is such an appealing, fun and entertaining read, whilst touching on the most serious of issues of abuse and miscarriages of justice. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Quercus for an ARC.", "This book is now a Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for romance, and it's also MY Goodreads Choice for romance, meaning this is very good and I enjoyed reading it and also Goodreads was involved. When I first read the synopsis of this book, I thought: I think I'll like this very much.Then I read a little bit of it and thought: Actually I do not think this is going to go very well. In fact I think this is going to go rather badly. Then I finished it and thought: As I said and as I, a liar, always believed I would, I liked this very much.When I saw this book about two people who don't know each other who share a flat (one has it in the day and one at night), and that they communicate via Post-It notes until they inevitably fall in love (I believe it is impossible to conduct epistolary interactions with someone over a long period of time and not fall in love with them), I believed this would be light and fluffy and adorable and just what I needed.This was not very light. Nor was it very fluffy. Actually it was very stressful and angsty and emotional. But it was what I needed???This is a very heartfelt and well-done story about supportive love and people healing from abuse and trauma and just all around character development joy. But a lot of suffering before we get to the joy part.It is just so very good. SO much better than I expected.Bottom line: LIKE I SAID. MY GOODREADS CHOICE. --------pre-reviewall right, i admit it! i'm swooning!!review to come / 4 stars--------i'm a simple girl. i read a scary book, then i immediately read a rom-com to soothe my cowardly soul", "4.5 stars.This book was just sweet and fun and it made me happy!Tiffy is in need of a place to live, since she\u2019s lived in her ex-boyfriend\u2019s apartment for far too long, even after he\u2019d begun dating someone else. But since she\u2019s in a low-paying job, there aren\u2019t a lot of options, so a flatshare opportunity makes the most sense.Leon is a hospice nurse who works nights, and she works days, so they\u2019ll literally never see each other, which is what convinces her to take this opportunity, even if it means sleeping in Leon\u2019s bed (although never with him). Leon's no-nonsense girlfriend Kay handles the transaction, thus ensuring Tiffy and Leon don't even meet. And since Leon will be spending weekends with Kay, there's no reason for any interaction.The two interact via post-it notes and memos, which grow from basic requests to much more personal conversations. And as each deals with their own crises\u2014Tiffy\u2019s ex can\u2019t seem to let go and is becoming increasingly more possessive, and Leon\u2019s brother is in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit\u2014amazingly, they are each other\u2019s greatest support, despite having never met each other.When a missed alarm clock leads to their meet-cute (and meet-wet), they begin to fall for each other. Tiffy brings a free-spiritedness to Leon\u2019s methodical ways, and Leon helps stabilize Tiffy, especially as she begins to realize how much harm her former boyfriend was causing her.Can love flourish when two people spend more time apart than together, and when they\u2019re so different from one another? When you\u2019ve been hurt before, can you let someone else in and let down your guard?I really enjoyed this book. Sure, it was predictable, but it was just so (to use a British colloquialism) lovely. At first I was a little off-put at Leon\u2019s way of speaking when he narrated, but ultimately it fit perfectly with his personality. \nThe Flatshare\n explored some important issues plus it charmed me completely. It was more than a typical rom-com but yet it never aspired to be anything lofty, just a good story.

It\u2019s hard for me to distinguish the many novels I read unless they are utterly unique.I\u2019m happy to say, that Beth O\u2019Learly did what I wish many other authors would do, she wrote a debut novel that was quirky, unique and had a most engaging plot. The Flatshare was a feel-good novel that was hard to forget. Memorable from begging to end, thanks to fabulous, vibrant and distinctive characters and an overall storyline that was heart touching and beautiful.The author deserves the bestseller lists. The hype is REAL and this book deserves to be read by every romance novel enthusiast.BECAUSE THE IDEA OF SHARING A FLAT WITH SOMEONE, BUT NEVER CATCHING SIGHT OF THE OTHER PERSON, EVEN THOUGH SHARING A BED IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE, WAS ABSOLUTELY INTRIGUING TO ME.I think for me the heart and soul of the story was the way Tiffy and Leon communicated with each other. Their post-it notes conversations were heart-warming, funny, touching, and just all around wonderful. A truly refreshing take on a romantic comedy. I actually was looking forward to those notes \u2013 maybe even more so than Leon himself.Besides the post-it chats, there were three major plots that wove beautifully through the entire story. These plots were connected by a cast of wonderful characters. Every single cast member was distinctively different in personality and voice. And I LOVED them all.Both Leon and Tiffy were genuine and nice. Easy to be liked. And a wonderful addition to anyones circle of friends. I\u2019m not surprised that they drew me in from almost the very beginning.\u201cAlmost\u201d because I needed a tiny bit of an adjustment period until I was truly comfortable with the authors writing style. Not only had the book a distinctive British voice (which I\u2019m a HUGE fan of) but Leon\u2019s alternating POV was quite peculiar. Moreover the author managed to capture the uniqueness of Leon\u2019s personality in an incredibly compelling way.Honestly, I have only great things to say about this debut novel. It might even be one of the most unique novels I read this year. And it definitely goes on my \u2018new to me author list of 2019\u2019.", "\nwhen i say all men are trash, leon twomey is obviously exempted\n", "3.75 stars - this was very cute and I really enjoyed the couple, but we didn\u2019t get very much of them in the grand scheme of things and I was expecting more romance.

TW: emotionally abusing ex; stalking; sibling in prison Tropes: - bed sharing", "\nThe Flatshare incorporates elements of adult romance, family/relationship drama, and brief domestic suspense all under a fairly original and likable umbrella. I enjoyed the epistolary components between 2 roommates that have never met and I liked the premise overall (3 stars).My favorite quote:N/A\n", "I should have known from the blurb on the front cover saying: \u201cThe new Jojo Moyes\u201d that this book was not gonna be my thing. This is a contemporary romance novel about this girl Tiffy who\u2019s boyfriends breaks up with her and she needs a place to live, so she moves into this apartment where Leon lives. Leon is a nurse and he works at night and he only uses the bed/apartment during the day so he needs a roommate to help him pay rent, and so Tiffy moves in and they share the same bed but they\u2019ve never met.This book had an interesting premise which is what made me want to read it - along with exceptional reviews from so many of my book friends. I thought I would love this. These characters are so dull and boring and this story is so dull and boring. Leon\u2019s chapters are written in such a strange, unnecessary way, and the different between these two writing styles between their chapters was jarring and hard to get used to. His chapters have no quotes around the dialogue and it feels so choppy and clunky. I wasn\u2019t a a fan of that writing style at all. Not to mention his character is so uninteresting and you know nothing about him besides his strange work hours, his needy girlfriend and his brother who\u2019s in prison. I feel like these two main characters spend the first half of this book not being able to get over their annoying douche bag exes, and they talk about them constantly and I was just frustrated. And then after the halfway point things started to get really cheesy for me and I just rolled my eyes a lot. This does read kind of like a Jojo Moyes romance so if you enjoy that author you\u2019ll probably love this but I personally did not, and I honestly don\u2019t understand the hype surrounding this book? What is so great about it? Did I miss something? \ud83d\ude05This is my 4th book completed for the reading rush, for the challenge: read an authors debut book.", "\ny'all trying to convince me to settle for real life men when guys like Leon Twomey exist in the fictional realm????that's just so unrealistic \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n", "Let's cut it short if you don't want to read the whole review. If you like to read contemporary feel good books that'll cheer you up, chick-lits, light spring/summer reads, you MUST read this book. It's a very good example of its kind that I haven't seen in a long time as a Sophie Kinsella fan. On the cover it says the new Jojo Moyes. As far as I'm concerned, this is much better! And, it's not a depressive book under the shelter of its umbrella. When I opened the book and started to read about Tiffy, this immediately gave me Sophie Kinsella vibes. I LOVE Sophie Kinsella, she\u2019s the sun of my gloomy days. Any time you feel bad, pick up a book of hers, and it\u2019ll cheer you up. But, as I moved on, it got actually more emotional than I anticipated. Also, there\u2019s definitely more to this book than traditional chick-lit romantic comedies. Race, controlling relationships, and backstories of these characters made it actually deeper and richer than I expected. However, the writing and the way O\u2019Leary brought these subjects to life doesn\u2019t make you gloomy at all. It comes to the surface very authentically and organically. Not depressive AT ALL. Plus, the jokes and humour is always there to make you smile every now and then \ud83d\ude42The set up of the story is what I loved the most. Tiffy and Leon never see each other as they live in the same flat at different times. I think it was a difficult task for the writer too, to develop a relationship through post-it notes that they start to leave to each other. It was very interesting and very well done.All in all, it was a really easy going, bright, yet emotional read that I enjoyed a lot. Would definitely recommend it these Spring days.", "3.5\u2018Tiffy & Leon share a flat. Tiffy & Leon share a bed. Tiffy & Leon have never met.\u2019That was such a unique adorable book.To be honest, I almost gave up on it. I couldn\u2019t get over how annoying the chapters in Leon\u2019s POV were written. I was so frustrated, and couldn\u2019t see the point in it. But then I see hope in the book and I decided to keep going. Also because the cover is gorgeous! It would be a shame to give up on a book with a cover like that.Tiffy and Leon have an unusual agreement. Those two are desperate enough to share a flat, or actually a bed, to be more specific. The thing is, they have never met. The plan was that Tiffy would have the flat by night and Leon would have it by day. They started communicating via post it notes -which was adorable, I loved those notes so much- but then their life which has been separate for too long started to intertwine.\u2019Look,\u2019 he says, \u2018have you ever looked forward to reading a book so much you can\u2019t actually start it?\u2019It took me a lot to finish the first 30% of the book. After that i couldn\u2019t stop. It was so good. Really adorable. And has great relatable characters. Even though I was annoyed by how Leon\u2019s chapters were written, I started to see the point. It suited his character really well. All the relationships in this book were perfect. I Loved Leon and Richie\u2019s relationship. Tiffy and her friends have the most supporting loving friendship. Also, Leon and Tiffy were so cute and he was so damn understanding and caring. This was an adorable fluffy chick-lit book that also deals with some heavy material like emotional abuse, gaslighting, and stalking.", "Although I generally read and review, \u201cMystery and Suspense\u201d novels, it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t occasionally enjoy seeing a Romantic Comedy in the theater, \ud83c\udf7f, or reading one when I just need a \u201cfeel good\u201d story! I needed one this week. And, I am happy to say that this book did not let me down! Tiffy Moore needed a cheap place to live. Leon Twomey needed some extra money.The problem: He lives in a flat that has just one bedroom, and one bed. The Solution: He will live there by day (he works nights as a palliative care nurse) and his new flat mate can live there by night. The two will even take turns using the same bed, since they will be in it at separate times! \ud83d\udeccYep, you read that right! Leon\u2019s girlfriend, Kay, isn\u2019t wild about the idea-so she will be in charge of interviewing and approving Leon\u2019s new flatmate. Her rule: Leon and Tiffy are never to be in the flat at the same time. In fact, only Kay will meet Tiffy prior to her moving in. The book is told from the alternating perspectives of Leon and Tiffy, as they get to know each other by sharing their thoughts on those sticky \u201c post it \u201c notes, ( fun to read!) and by leaving food for one another! \u2615\ufe0fA great cast of supporting characters provide equally compelling sub plots, which I will let you discover on your own.

It sounded so yummy! \ud83d\ude0b", "\nI read this entire novel in one sitting on a Sunday afternoon; it's a romantic comedy that manages to tackle serious issues while maintaining a light and breezy feel. Don't miss the backstory on how the author's personal life inspired the premise, and how she managed to write nearly every word of the 320-page novel on her own commute in and out of London. There are a few spicy scenes but this romance is mostly closed-door.\n", "\"Eventually she leans forward and kisses me slowly, tasting of icing.Tiffy: I'll be worth the wait. You'll see.As if I'd ever doubted it.\"Sometimes, when I stumble upon a book I have this strong and powerful certainty that that is a book for me. My gut tells me that this is a book with the raw potential to make me fall in love with. And guys, my gut is often wrong. As soon as I spotted The Flatshare cover, an alarm went off in my head. By the time I had read the synopsis I was certain this was a book I would absolutely adore. Spoiler alert: I was right. Life works in mysterious ways sometimes.And that\u2019s exactly what the premise of The Flatshare is all about. Tiffy, who is an editor in a small publishing house in London, is looking for a flat. Her budget is small and her changes to find one are even smaller. So when she finds Leon ad, even if a little skeptical, she jumps at the chance. The arrangement is easy enough, they share Leon\u2019s flat. All of it. Kitchen, living room, bathroom and also bed. The trick? Tiffy gets the flat from 7pm to 8am, and Leon, who is a nurse working strictly on night shifts, gets the rest. Somehow *cough not somehow but because of Leon\u2019s partner at the beginning of the novel cough* Tiffy moves in without having met Leon, and somehow, they fall into a routine that consists of leaving post-it notes for each other around the flat. They strictly communicate through notes, as they slowly grow to know and like each other even if they haven\u2019t really met in real life. Until the day they end up in the flat at the same time that is.Tiffy and Leon's story is about how destiny - or coincidences for those of you that are skeptical - can turn things around and insert into your life that person that you didn't even know you needed to make it all better.The author also managed to deal with serious issues (TG psychological abuse) wonderfully, giving them the importance that they have without losing the lightness of the narrative and story.All in all, this book overflows with cuteness, British charm and emotion. It's a read that will warm your heart, shed light into your life for a little while and stay with you for long time.*The publisher provided an early copy for review in exchange for an honest review", "Just a few hours ago, I returned this book to my public library. I did not want to return it! It was a lovely book. If I did not own more than 500 books I would buy it so I could have it on my shelf. I love quirky characters in my reading, and that, Tiffy was. I also love when the names chosen in books are lovely names. Her name really suited her. Tiffy is a lovely young woman, but she has not met a nice man. A topical subject which I read about often, is gas lighting. It disturbs me that dating and relationship happenings have so many terms these days, does it mean our world is becoming transactional? I think so. There are terms for liking someone a little, but hanging on until something better comes along, and liking someone enough to have sex with, but not enough to be faithful. Scary stuff!Tiffy is a clever girl, she has gotten away from her obsessive ex-boyfriend, this has been very hard. At every chance he could get he would be breaking up with her, requesting a reconciliation and suggesting it was her idea in the first place. He would subtly communicate she was not allowed out with girlfriends, but so cunningly this was not obvious at the time. He would trick her into thinking she\u2019d forgotten things when they did not exist in the first place. He was a nasty piece of work.Working as an editorial assistant on a pitiful wage, Tiffy needs some new accommodations now that she has finally made the decision to rid of this nasty man. Ending up in a funny but workable situation with a shift working nurse, Tiffy has the flat at night, and Leon during the day. Thus begins an adorable post it note scenario of letter writing; they end up all over the flat. Tiffy has a wardrobe with personality, and Leon can\u2019t quite work out who the woman is behind the post it notes, but conjures an image of an older and not so attractive woman!Tiffy\u2019s best mates are adorable, and Leon\u2019s family situation and career very interesting and full of equally likable characters. This is a serious book and a lovely light hearted one all at once, if that is possible. Here is a link to an article I came across this weekend. https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/b...I hope you love the book as much as I did.", "This is a chick lit book all about the importance of consent and I \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb AM \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb HERE FOR IT \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb.Seriously. The witty banter, slow burn romance, and quirky friendships were all A+, but the consent message is what kept this at the 5-star level for me.I have no other words other than this was really bitchin\u2019.", "4.5 starsThis is one of my favorite romance reads of 2019. I just had so much fun rooting for the two characters to get together and thought they had really good chemistry which is so key in a romance novel. I thought the premise for this one was pretty clever as the two characters share an apartment but have never met because of their different work schedules. They communicate with notes left around their flat and text messages. Tiffy Moore is fun and has a bit of an outlandish style. She is also out of an apartment and having a hard time getting over a recent breakup. Leon, works the night shift and is in desperate need of some extra cash to help his brother out. He decides to get a roommate for his one bedroom flat. He enlists his girlfriend to interview potential roommates and feeling not threatened at all by Tiffy, she selects her to live with him. Given the flat only has one bedroom, Tiffy and Leon will be using the same bed to sleep in but because of their different work schedules and with Leon spending the weekend with his girlfriend, they will never be around each other in person. (This sounds like a completely weird premise, but trust me, the author somehow makes this work). With brief notes left in the apartment for one another, they somehow start to develop a friendship. And well, I guess you will just have to read the book to find out more.It didn't take long for me to really get into the story and characters. It's like everything just clicked right away and I could just sit back and enjoy where the story was headed. While I would say overall the story takes on a lighthearted tone, there are some serious issues explored, mostly in regards to Tiffy's relationship with her ex. It's one of those enjoyable reads with a little bit of substance to elevate it from just another generic romance. Very happy to have read this one! Highly recommend this book if you love a good romance.", "\nThis is such a cute and fluffy chicklit and I have no idea why it took me so long to read the whole thing.

{"published_year": "2016", "rating_counts": "424617", "ISBN": null, "description": "Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we\u2019ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let\u2019s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn\u2019t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is\u2014a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let\u2019s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited\u2014\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.", "Img": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707.jpg", "title": "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life", "authors": "Mark Manson", "detailLink": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck", "reviews": ["If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word \"fuck\" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former \"bangs all the ladies\" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.", "Masterpiece, incredibly funny. i don't usally go for self help books cause to me they are all the same! Smile more, love more, hate less, don't give up, it's gonna be okay, it's all in your head. Blah blah blah.... but this one was the exception. Anything with curse words on the cover picks my interest :P The first half of it was my favorite, the aim of this book is to help the reader to think a little bit more clearly about what they\u2019re choosing to find important in life and what they\u2019re choosing to find unimportant.These are few of my favrite quotes in this book:The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one\u2019s negative experience is itself a positive experience.Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re the same thing.Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that\u2019s likely to save the planet one day. Ironically, this fixation on the positive\u2014on what\u2019s better, what\u2019s superior\u2014only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she\u2019s happy. She just is.Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more\u2014buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.The Feedback Loop from HellThere\u2019s an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you\u2019re so anxious. Now you\u2019re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you\u2019re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where\u2019s the whiskey?", "\nAfter a reread I'm flipping a near 180 on this one. It's a very surface level look at Stoicism and western Buddhism aimed at dudebros. It still has some good things to say, but it's got so many problems that I don't even want to get into it, I just want to distance myself from it at this point and apologize for recommending it.I would suggest Why Buddhism is True and The Practicing Stoic instead as much better books to read that cover the same ground more in depth, without any of the negatives.\n", "\nI started out liking this book, I really did. By the time I was halfway in, his smug attitude about things he frankly knows jack shit about were getting on my nerves. He made some excellent points, all of which have been made countless times by other, more competent writers. Read Sartre, Camus, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, and various Buddhist texts instead. Regurgitating Eastern philosophy and existentialism while swearing a lot only gets you so far. I stopped reading and returned this book.\n", "\nWhat a load of self-indulgent, sexist codswallop.\n", "\nHave you ever been in a bar and had a know-it-all tell you everything you need to know about life without any evidence to back up what he's saying? That's what this book felt like.\n", "I'm not actually done yet, but this book is becoming more problematic by the page. In re: false memories and page 128: False memories are absolutely a thing. But when the example you use to illustrate this fact is a 1980's feminist who falsely accused her father of abuse and you follow up with \"in the early 1980s and 1990s hundreds of innocent people were wrongly accused of sexual violence under similar circumstances. Many of them went to prison for it\" you are being supremely irresponsible. The casual reader who is not familiar with sexual violence and rape and abuse could easily walk away with the impression that survivors of sexual assault often make up their assault. This is utterly, utterly untrue - we know that rape and incest are some of the most under reported and under prosecuted crimes, and that the possibility of not being believed plays a big role in that.***Finally finished. One star. You don't need to read this book. ", "\nDefinitely written by and for straight, white, entitled males. I have no fucks to give for this book or the author.\n", "I knew after the first chapter that I probably wasn't the intended audience for this book. Most of it was sort of a \"duh\" for me, but I continued on in hopes I would learn something new...WOW, this author is SO self-indulgent. He misses no opportunity to remind us about what a complete \"fuckboi\" he was in his twenties. The problem with this is that his tone (and the fact that he brings it up over and over and over and over again) makes it sound like it is almost a point of pride rather than something to be remorseful about. There are a lot of (re-packaged Buddhist and psych) truth nuggets in here, but they're definitely mired in a lot of privileged bullshit. ", "Has anybody been unfortunate enough to be sitting in a pub, enjoying a quiet meal, and out of nowhere, a rather drunk individual parks himself beside you, and then just doesn't stop talking about life and everything HE thinks that you should be doing, but without any solid proof to back himself up? I have, and this book by Mark Manson made me feel like I was back in that pub, but with an even dodgier individual attempting to give me life lessons. Seeing this book for the first time, I'll admit, I was pretty revved up about reading it. I mean, lets be honest, a bright orange cover with \"The subtle art of not giving a fu*k\" boldly plastered on it, you can hardly miss it. The book began with an introduction, which made me feel like this was was going to be a truly life changing read. Well, from the words \"Chapter one\" it all took a swift nose dive. Manson began the first few chapters with a lot of \"Fuck this, fuck that, fuck you\" kind of attitude. I can take cursing, but this, was kind of tiring. This was like listening to a young person that has just discovered the art of cursing. It sucked. There were some interesting points, but you need to dig deep to find them. I found that this book had mostly opinions, with a few hidden facts chucked in for good measure. I cannot understand how Romeo and Juliet could be brought into this book, then a couple of pages later, Buddhism, and then many fucks later, he is telling us that HE is amazing, as he has the audacity to inform his wife when she looks shitty, and, best of all, apparently she loves that. I just don't buy it.For me, this book is just a preachy retelling of stuff we already know, written by an average male and, I'm still trying to understand what possessed me to spend actual money on this! Absolutely no fucks given.", "Based on the title, I was pretty stoked for this, and the introductory essay explaining the author's Not Giving a F*ck theory made a lot of sense to me and made me really happy. Essentially, he says that the internet and the media demand that we give a f*ck about everything, but we only have so much time on Earth and so many f*cks to give and we have to choose who and what we spend those f*cks on. Makes sense.Unfortunately, the rest of the book turns into the same self-help drivel you see in any other \"how to be happy\" kind of book, only Manson starts to present the information with a tone reminiscent of an Andrew Dice Clay routine. No bueno. I ended up having to bail.", "I don't read self-help. I simply don't believe in the self-help genre. If you need a book to help you live your life you have bigger problems than whatever brought you to that book. That may seem harsh but its just my opinion and you are free to ignore it.Since I don't read self-help, you may be asking \"Erin, Why did you read this book? Blame Popsugar. I'm doing the Popsugar 2017 Reading challenge and needed to read a book from a genre I don't usually read. As you can see if you look at my book shelf I pretty much read every genre. So I narrowed it down to 3 genres: Self-help, Christian, or Amish Romance. I picked Self-help. Mark Manson is proof that anyone can get a book deal. I understand that he has a very popular blog and publishing is about money but God this book is bad. I found myself speed reading it just so it would end.

Well for starters, Mark Manson is a real douche. There has never been a better husband than Mark Manson. Why? He doesn't put up with bullshit. If his wife looks like shit he tells her. He won't tolerate her looking bad no matter how much time she has spent getting ready to go out. And we must take note of how edgy Manson is. He actually figured out you can remove the word care and replace it with fuck. WOW! How profound! What he really means in the quote above is caring too much is bad for you. Oh, let's not forget how he loves to give added emphasis to things. When talking about music, it's not enough to reference The Beatles, they are the The GODDAMN Beatles. What Manson has done here is dust off some older self-help philosophies, replace as many words as possible with FUCK and tried to make it look shiny, new and innovative. It's not. Manson proudly announces he cuts through the crap! But alas, he does not. What Manson really does is steal some ideas from Buddhism and works hard to make himself look like a wise philosopher, and old soul. There are only so many things we can care about so we need to figure out which ones really matter ~~ sorry ~~ There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Or how about this gem: \"While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.\" Wow! While Manson pats himself on the back for this gem, I can't help but think of Emerson, \u201cIts the not the Destination, It's the journey.\u201d Thankfully, Manson brilliantly improves on Emerson and makes himself so much more profound in this generation-defining self-help guide. Most of Manson's observations make me roll my eyes, or at times, laugh out loud. How did we survive as a society without Mark Manson?Manson has a new book coming out in May. Maybe I'll read it, but probably not, because honestly, I just don't give a fuck ...", "I went into this admittedly with quite some skepticism and entitlement\u2014 \u201cwhat is this going to teach me that I don\u2019t already know?\u201d\u2014 but The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is truly one of the most ground-shaping nonfiction books I\u2019ve read so far. It will and can change a perspective, a life. And as such, this is the perfect book to give to your loved ones on holidays, birthdays...It made me rethink all the times I ever gave a fuck over some of the most irrelevant things in hindsight. It made me realize that it\u2019s sometimes necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate why I think so-and-so on a daily basis.I also wrote down a lot of Mark Manson\u2019s writing into my notes because I knew I would need it in the near future. And I would like to thank him for answering quite a lot of fears of mine with such a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck was both personally relevant and entertaining.Here are a few pieces that helped me and then some:\u201cThe key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it\u2019s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.\u201d\u201cBecause when you give too many fucks\u2014when you give a fuck about everyone and everything\u2014you will feel that you\u2019re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere\u201dYES! This is exactly how I feel when I give too many fucks about things that have little lasting impact on my life.\u201cLife is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark,\u201d the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. \u201cThe solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.\u201dA moment passed, and then I wondered where the fuck the talking panda came from. And while we\u2019re at it, who made these margaritas?\u201cDon\u2019t hope for a life without problems,\u201d the panda said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.\u201dDisappointment Panda was one of the best additions to this book.\u201cWho you are is defined by what you\u2019re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.See: it\u2019s a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you\u2019re allowed to stop climbing, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.\u201dThis book is slowly but surely shifting my world.\u201cIf you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.\u201d\u201cHonesty is a good value because it\u2019s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others (even if it\u2019s sometimes unpleasant). Popularity, on the other hand, is a bad value. If that\u2019s your value, and if your metric is being the most popular guy/girl at the dance party, much of what happens will be out of your control: you don\u2019t know who else will be at the event, and you probably won\u2019t know who half those people are. Second, the value/metric isn\u2019t based on reality: you may feel popular or unpopular, when in fact you have no fucking clue what anybody else really thinks about you. (Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)\u201dThat side note is speaking the truth!!!\u201cI\u2019m not saying that this excused what my ex did\u2014not at all. But recognizing my mistakes helped me to realize that I perhaps hadn\u2019t been the innocent victim I\u2019d believed myself to be. That I had a role to play in enabling the shitty relationship to continue for as long as it did. After all, people who date each other tend to have similar values. And if I dated someone with shitty values for that long, what did that say about me and my values? I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it\u2019s likely you are too, you just don\u2019t realize it.\u201dTaking responsibly for your actions, but not blaming yourself was one of the most valuable lessons I got from Mark Manson.\u201cA lot of people might hear all of this and then say something like, \u201cOkay, but how? I get that my values suck and that I avoid responsibility for all of my problems and that I\u2019m an entitled little shit who thinks the world should revolve around me and every inconvenience I experience\u2014but how do I change?\u201dAnd to this I say, in my best Yoda impersonation: \u201cDo, or do not; there is no \u2018how.\u2019 \u201dYou are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.It really is that simple. It\u2019s just not easy.It\u2019s not easy because you\u2019re going to feel like a loser, a fraud, a dumbass at first. You\u2019re going to be nervous. You\u2019re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at your wife or your friends or your father in the process. These are all side effects of changing your values, of changing the fucks you\u2019re giving. But they are inevitable.It\u2019s simple but really, really hard.\u201d\u201cGrowth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don\u2019t go from \u201cwrong\u201d to \u201cright.\u201d Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong. And when we learn something additional, we go from slightly less wrong to slightly less wrong than that, and then to even less wrong than that, and so on. We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.\u201dHe\u2019s changing my world right now.\u201cWe all have values for ourselves. We protect these values. We try to live up to them and we justify them and maintain them. Even if we don\u2019t mean to, that\u2019s how our brain is wired. As noted before, we\u2019re unfairly biased toward what we already know, what we believe to be certain. If I believe I\u2019m a nice guy, I\u2019ll avoid situations that could potentially contradict that belief. If I believe I\u2019m an awesome cook, I\u2019ll seek out opportunities to prove that to myself over and over again. The belief always takes precedence. Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change.In this way, \u201cknowing yourself\u201d or \u201cfinding yourself\u201d can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities.I say don\u2019t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that\u2019s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.\u201dI didn't even realize I felt this way until I saw it so clearly on paper.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that\u2019s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you\u2019re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you\u2019re implicitly telling yourself, \u201cI\u2019m the exception; I\u2019m unlike everybody else; I\u2019m different and special.\u201dThis is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn\u2019t obey the laws of the physical universe.My recommendation: don\u2019t be special; don\u2019t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.\u201dThat thing about the plane is 100% me!! So I get it know: if you think you\u2019re special\u2014decide not to be.\u201cThe desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they deserve to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.\u201d\u201cIf you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you\u2019ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they\u2019re performed without conditions or expectations.\u201d\n\nDamn, I wasn\u2019t prepared for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck to completely change my worldview in such a meaningful way.

He is probably having a great old laugh at the fact that his mantra `dont try` has resulted in an awful written book, full of cliches, calling reader `dumbass`, referring to us wanting to feel jennifer aniston`s t#ts , and bigging himself up generally. He probably finds it hilarious that a load of suckers, like me , bought it. The zen in me tells me lesson is learned, don't fall for arresting titles and stop being impressed by introductory chapters referencing Bukowski. Don't make this mistake again!!!Ah, the money probably brings him little happiness. He probably in dire need of therapy or funds to hire ladies resembling Friends characters or writing classes. All is well with the world and I am happy these are much needed things my contribution can go toward.All's ok now. Don't give a fu#k.", "My, my! What a catchy title!I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I picked this up. And now that I'm done? Well, I agree with everything Manson says, but (like other reviewers have mentioned) everything he's written about is common sense stuff. Is that revolutionary?Maybe.What does it say about our society in general that any of what he's saying is...well, remotely necessary to say!?When the basic premise of a bestseller is that you should stop comparing yourself to what you see on television, movies, and social media, and just be content to be the best version of yourself - and scads of people find this to be awe-inspiring? Then perhaps it really did need to be said.The gist of this \"groundbreaking\" book is that there's no way to insulate yourself from bad times, and even if you could, those hardships are what make us better people. One of the biggest problems we seem to have is this nonsensical idea that chasing happiness is a worthwhile goal. I mean, it sounds great on paper, but it's not in any way, shape, or form realisitc...or healthy. Life will not give you a happy ending. Period. Endings are always sad. And we need to get over this ridiculous idea that at some point we'll get to sigh a big sigh of relief because our fairytale Happily Ever After has arrived.We can all save ourselves the trouble of trying to find happiness by just realizing that we need to choose to be happy now. Enjoy the small stuff, my friends, because tomorrow might just suck a giant dick. Your life will be good until it isn't. You'll be in love until you aren't. Your job will be fulfilling until you lose it. You'll be alive until you're dead. And nothing you do will change that.Ok, granted, that doesn't sound awesome.But the point is, if you stop trying to live for some future Happiness High, prioritize what means the most to you now, and live with a fearless attitude towards the future? Then you're going to be much more content (and yes, happy) than someone who is constantly trying to measure up to unrealistic goals they've set in order achieve a sense of fulfillment.The end.The book itself is fairly short and Manson's voice isn't terribly annoying.Read it or not. I don't give a fuck.", "A lot of necessary to hear hard truths.There is a distinction between what the title implies and what Manson intends. Manson is essentially inviting us to only care about what\u2019s important and let the rest take care of itself.I\u2019ve been accused of indifference or \u201cliving in a bubble\u201d for years because I don\u2019t follow politics and rarely watch the news. My mantra is the serenity prayer:God grant me the serenityto accept the things I cannot change;\u00a0courage to change the things I can;\u00a0and wisdom to know the difference.My Muslim friends will sometimes say \u201cInshallah\u201d which literally translates into \u201cif Allah wills it\u201d or \u201cIf God wills it\u201d. When I first heard this, I mistakenly thought it was akin to \u201cscrew it\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d but I think this is more similar to the serenity prayer and also what Manson is talking about.I learned years ago that I cannot help or fix everything and to even try is unfair to me, the people I most care about and ultimately the people I am trying to help also. Spread yourself too thin, care too much, give a f*** about stuff that is beyond your reach, and you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure.Manson steers clear of religion for the most part (he does reference Buddhism a few times) and most of his self-help is philosophical in nature. He also provides plenty of illuminating anecdotes to illustrate his perspicacious observations. This also made me consider Aaron James\u2019 2012 book Assholes: A Theory as Manson spends a fair amount of time describing the actions and motivations of those among us who feel entitled.A fun and insightful book.** 2018 - Great book to think back on and its simple truths. I do give a f***, but I can't fix everything and I accept that. Ultimately its about boundaries and priorities. ", "\n4 stars!  This book wasn't only about giving no fucks, it was about giving fucks about only the important things. If you're going to read it, I would recommend the audio book. I thought the narration was great and it was highly entertaining and made me laugh out loud more than once!!\n", "(Audiobook)It's not about not giving a f*ck about anything, it's about giving a f*ck about the things that matter most. In essence, the question is, should I really give a f*ck?This is sort of an anti-hero self-help book, something you should read (or hear) if you feel the world weighing up a little bit too much. It just unburdens you of some stuff. No real groundbreaking philosophy, just a couple of useful hints and insights on how to take things more lightly, when taking them seriously is hurting you. Chapters 1 and 2 were pure magic. The kind of magic that wouldn't be too bad to hear once or twice a year. If not for the hints, for the laughs. There are also some interesting comments on chapter 8, and some anecdotes here and there. The rest of the book was kind of meh. Funny meh, sure, but typical self-help textbook lines that tires a bit, if not a lot. Couldn't be happier to have chosen audio rather than ebook. Cursing can seem very aggressive when reading it on text, but hearing it through the voice of the narrator it became so much easier, and funnier. Tips: Don't take it too seriously, develop a tolerance to hear the word f*ck once too many often, and just enjoy the ride.Until next time,-----------------------------------------------No es sobre que nada te importe un c*rajo.

Algo que uno deber\u00eda leer (o escuchar) si empez\u00e1s a sent\u00edr que el mundo te pesa mucho sobre los hombros. S\u00f3lo te libera de algunas cosas.

Ese tipo de magia que no viene mal escucharla una o dos veces al a\u00f1o. Sino por los consejos, por las risas. Tiene tambi\u00e9n algunos comentarios interesantes en el cap\u00edtulo 8, y alguna que otra an\u00e9ctoda aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1. El resto del libro es medio meh, meh gracioso s\u00ed, pero t\u00edpica ret\u00f3rica de autoayuda que cansa un poco, sino mucho.No podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s feliz de haberlo escuchado en vez de leerlo. Las puteadas pueden sonar muy agresivas cuando uno las lee en texto, pero escucharlas a trav\u00e9s de la voz del narrador hace que sea mucho m\u00e1s ameno, y gracioso.Consejos: No tomarlo muy en serio, desarrollar una tolerancia a escuchar puteadas algo m\u00e1s que seguido, y s\u00f3lo disfrutar el viaje.Hasta la pr\u00f3xima,", "My sister asked me to get her this and I\u2019ve read it as well. It is basically the Buddha and Sartre giving advice by saying fuck every other word. Not a terrible thing, in itself, but a bit like seeing a play where all the actors are naked, the swearing loses its impact after about the third fuck, and then you\u2019re just left with the advice.I don\u2019t normally read self-help books \u2013 the problem I have with them is the first word, more than the second. We generally all need some sort of help, but that rarely is helped much by any notion of \u2018self\u2019. Ultimately, this guy says much the same thing, which rather surprised me, but shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 I\u2019ve already mentioned Buddhism, which has a particularly low opinion of selfhood. But we are so obsessed with being individuals in our society that he probably didn\u2019t feel he could just come out and say from the start \u2013 well, get over yourself, fuck face.His advice is basically that you only have so many fucks you can give in life \u2013 but life tries to structure itself so that we are in a near perpetual state of outrage. And that way heart attacks lie. His advice isn\u2019t to stop caring, that would be impossible, but to try to decide what you are going to care about and, well, do something about that. In some ways this isn\u2019t too different from something I read by Byung-Chul Han recently \u2013 that outrage never changed the world, only rage can. So, pick what you are going to be enraged about and skip the outrage.This isn\u2019t a terrible book, in fact, most of the advice is quite reasonable. All the same, I feel most of the problems we face as humans are to do with the fact we are social animals and our lives are becoming increasingly insular \u2013 not least due to various forms of technology \u2013 and this is making us feel pretty awful about ourselves. We need to find ways to rebuild communities and meaningful human interactions. And we\u2019ve known this for ages \u2013 have a quick read of Durkheim\u2019s Suicide and his explanation of why Catholics and Jews have lower rates of suicide than Protestants. Our obsession with being individuals is literally killing us. The fact this guy bases much of his advice on psychology, to me anyway, is part of the problem \u2013 I figure it involves him looking intently down the wrong end of the telescope \u2013 but all the same, this is a quick and easy read and parts of it are amusing.", "I'm not one for self-help books, but this one spoke to me: \"The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.\" I don't know how to review this book without typing out the whole book, so I'm going to try something different: to be brief. This book provides support for someone who wants to live in reality, someone who doesn't want to buy into our national capitalist mindset that life is about chasing one high after another. This book encourages you to embrace conflict, to be comfortable feeling uncomfortable, and to be confident in finding out what you truly believe in, then standing up for it. Fuck being likeable. Take responsibility for your own life, stop trying to solve other's problems (a big one for me to work on!), ask questions, and always try to make things better. \"Happiness is a struggle.\"My one criticism of this book eventually turned into a positive. Around Chapter Six my interest started to wane because Manson provided me with very little I didn't already know. Plus, he shares his own story about entering his adult life at \"rock bottom.\" His life's lowest points: getting caught with marijuana at school, his parents' divorce, not finding a job immediately after college. My initial reaction was, are you fucking kidding me? If that's rock bottom, my life exists in a subterranean cavern. However, Mark Manson's life is not mine. Everyone's experiences are subjective. And, in a way, I admire him even more because of our differences. He led an easy life compared to mine, but he recognized his own privileges and entitlements and worked toward fixing them. Then, he took his own personal realizations about life and shared them in this book, which in turn helps me and others. I rarely read a book that makes me want to thank the author, but -- Thanks for this, Mark. ", " \u2620 DNF at 29% By the end of chapter 1, I was OD'ing on the word fuck. Unbelievably improbable as it sounds, my best friend Kara Gillian has nothing on this guy here. And that, my Little Barnacles, is saying a whole bloody fucking lot.By the end of chapter 2, I'd had it with Mark Manson's smug, narcissistic, sanctimonious, clich\u00e9d-to-death-and-back, infantilizing, everyone-but-me-is-a-fucking complete-dumbass, self-indulgent, shamelessly-repackaged-Eastern-philsophy-for-nitwits rubbish hogwash drivel poppycock balderdash gibberish sorry I ran out of polite synonyms CRAP.By the end of chapter 3, I didn't give a bloody stinking fuck anymore. Yay! Mission accomplished and stuff! P.S. I'm so joyfully, blissfully happy I DNFed the fuck fish out of this one before getting to the sexist bullshit. Hadn't I displayed such amazing powers of prescience and precognition and stuff, the murderous crustaceans would have no doubt been slightly unleashed on a certain person who, come to think of it, probably would not have given half a quarter of a fuck about it, because he is so wonderfully detached like that. Oh, and by the way:(view spoiler)[You're welcome. (hide spoiler)]", "\n\nInstagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPsychological snake oil for the pseudo intellectual.Man, reading this book was so frustrating, because I'd heard so many good things. Some people told me that this book was life-changing, game-changing, and then one of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought, \"Cool, bring it on. I'm ready to hand out fuck-wafers like it's time for the Sunday Communion of Nobody-Gives-A-Damn.\" After reading this book, I've come to the conclusion that the people who like this book haven't taken any psychology classes or read any philosophy books, because this is like the watered-down, urban legend- and common sense-based rehashing of basic tenets you would learn in Phi or Psych 101. Mark Manson seems to me like a dudebro, tossing around the word \"fuck\" like a preteen who's just discovered swearing. But only for the first couple chapters. Then he forgets himself to his navel-gazing, talking about how we should change our values in life and how emotions only affect us insofar as we let them. Which is true, to an extent, but then he brings up how someone who had lost their son prematurely got mad at him on his blog, and Manson gets so upset about it that he feels the need to whine about his experience here, bragging to us about how he decided not to have the last word. But isn't that what you're doing here? You are giving a fuck, and you are immortalizing that fuck you gave in print, while telling us simultaneously that you did not give it. Hmm, sketchy.He also talks about his trip to Russia and praises the Russians for not sugar-coating and telling it like it is, the takeaway being that he admired them for saying \"That's stupid,\" when someone says something stupid. Then he brags about how he likes to tell his wife when she doesn't look good, and how much she appreciates this gaslighting, and how few men would dare to do this amazing thing that he is doing (telling her she looks like shit, according to him). She gets angry, he says, but ultimately she appreciates his honesty. Yeah, I fucking bet. This was straight out of those gross pick-up artist books that teach generations of young males how to neg women to win sex points. #NotAllMenManson had a couple good points, but they were buried in a lot of garbage. For example, in a chapter about relationships, he opens up with the synopsis of Romeo and Juliet as a cautionary example, but then he also tries to namedrop actual science like Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiments, and then also namedrops the Buddha when talking about suffering and the inevitability of pain and strife. I am a psychology major who worked in a research laboratory as an undergraduate and I like hard science with data and solid case examples. When I see an article that looks fishy, I look up the facts to determine whether or not it is true. I read scholarly articles. I don't fuck with bullshit. I would rather give a fuck than fuck with bullshit, if you get me. This book did not have facts. It had a lot of opinions masquerading with facts, but honestly, if I want someone to preach dime-store philosophy at me, I'll go to a bar in downtown San Francisco and listen to the vodka fume revelations of CFOs.2 fucks given", "\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: About This Book!\n", "Oh, wow. I loved this. I really really loved this. I loved that this was so... freely written. Who cares if there are tons of curses in it? Everything he says or teaches us is always followed or introduced with a personal or historical story. There are always examples, stories, explanations that are not overly complicated. The whole book was full of honest, true and really interesting stuff. These were my favorite: - Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. - Pain, in all of its forms, is our body\u2019s most effective means of spurring action. - People who become great at something become great because they understand that they\u2019re not already great - they are mediocre, they are average - and that they could be so much better. - Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you\u2019re going to start crying at inappropriate times. - This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. - Until we change how we view ourselves, what we believe we are and are not, we cannot overcome our avoidance and anxiety. We cannot change. - If you\u2019re stuck on a problem, don\u2019t sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. - You too are going to die, and that\u2019s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. All in all I\u2019ll just recommend this to all my non-reader friends and to you, my wonderful Goodreads people, because I loved it and I want you to read this too! Happy reading \u2665\ufe0f", "This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription  \u201cLife is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.\u201d\ud83c\udf1f I am not a big fan of Self Help books to be honest. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I just believe that we all have different experiences and we will learn by trying. I also believe that most of what those Self help books are saying is just so obvious and I don\u2019t need to read about it to know it. Despite that, I enjoyed the book and can not say that it won\u2019t affect me one way or another.\ud83c\udf1f The book starts out by cussing, actually a lot! I was not happy by all of that Effing going around but then it became cooler and easier to read. There was a lot of repetition to be honest. Like the idea would be repeated too many times through different chapter in a kind of similar wording.\ud83c\udf1f I enjoyed the real life examples that the book provides and these are always better than the theoretical part. One of the things that I will be applying is to check which metric I am using. A concept that was discussed for the whole part of the book and I think it was the most important one. For example: As book bloggers we have to choose a metric: Is it going to be how much followers I have and having a certain goal in mind or comparing your follower to a large blog. In the first case, a blogger will be happy for example with 100 followers while in the later case, the blogger will keep trying to reach an ever-growing blog and will feel that they are not achieving anything.\ud83c\udf1f Summary: I know this book will not be for everyone and that many will hate it as evidenced by the many 1 stars in the top reviews pages on GR. I believe that you can get something out of this book even if you are not a fan of self-help books as me. I read it because I wanted a less stressful 2019 and I hope it helps me in achieving so.

The more the choices we have, the more suffering it may bring to choose any one, no matter if we choose the right or wrong one. While commitment to a particular thing brings more peace and joy!SEEK THE TRUTH FOR YOURSELF AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE!The facts the author tried to convey through this part of the book are difficult to grab and hard to come to terms with!

They have huge insight in them. The art of living we should learn by always keeping in mind the inevitable truth of our mortality!What I din't like was that the book is repetitious at a lot of places.There weren't too many new concepts introduced. There was nothing I could say was eye opening to me!For people newly out in the practical life, this book can serve as the lighthouse.But for mature people, well guys we have already learnt a lot more than this book could offer!", "\nI don't recall how many times I failed to feel motivated to read a book for school or start an assignment but did it anyways because of a sense of duty, being a student and all.

So I agree that action can bring about inspiration which can lead to motivation. \n", "I think The Subtle Art... might have had more impact upon me if I was 20-something instead of 59-years-old. The language isn't really an issue (it just becomes another word that doesn't even seem to have much meaning); it's more that Manson is repetitive and doesn't offer anything original that most people haven't learned for themselves in a few decades of experience.
